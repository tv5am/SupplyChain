this place is a poster child for yet another over-rated SF restaurant,unprofessional service and food that is mediocre at best.Lots of attempts to be "creative" but once you clear away the fussy decorations on the plate,you are left w/maybe 3-4 decent bites of food!! Sorry,too many other places that are better and dont practice the art of pretension like this place does!! I was shocked that Bauer gave it such praise.......	0
The chicken was honestly JUST OK. Dried thyme in the dredge is terrible. I didn&#39;t finish my chicken. I don&#39;t even remember the waffle but the chicken was so sub par, with a name like Sweet Chick you&#39;d think they would have perfected the fried chicken. They did not.<br><br>Pluses: <br>The drinks are really good.<br>Nice atmosphere<br>Flavored butters<br><br>Negatives: <br>Long wait for no reason<br>Chicken.	0
After dining here, I can't really say I understand what the big deal is with this place. There was great anticipation for this restaurant as it was visited by Anthony Bourdain. I had to make a reservation three weeks out to get a decent time for my birthday dinner. When we arrived, the place was packed with wait times in the hour range. The food was good, but we did not find it be better than many places we frequent at home (Chicago). It's overpriced and you are rushed out of the restaurant by very cold serving staff. I wish I had done a bit better research to find a different place. Don't waste your time with a wait that could be hours long. If you are okay with an expensive dinner, spend it at another place that could be more worth it.	0
Let&#39;s get the facts down. This place has been open for so damned long it&#39;s practically a monument to the good ol&#39; days of Los Angeles before the skyscrapers, credit cards, douchebags, and expensive parking and horrendous traffic. And smog.<br><br>It&#39;s cash only, but they have an ATM.<br><br>Parking across the street for it specifically is $2. Two dollars, even when they require validation, in a city where half-a-block or even next door to that lot can be anywhere from $10 to $50 on a game night.<br><br>Yes, it&#39;s a bit pricey. But damn, is it good and filling. The milkshakes are plentiful and made from real ice cream. The food is hearty. The cole slaw is amazing. <br><br>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I don&#39;t like cole slaw. I can barely take a side salad if I don&#39;t have something to add to the flavor. But their cole slaw is the king of slaws. I would fill up alone on that if I didn&#39;t realize I had other food coming. <br><br>Granted, there are times when the food isn&#39;t great or worth the price, but just for the sheer staple of the place, I would pay for it. We got to sit at the counter the last time we visited, and ain&#39;t no one get to sit at the counter most of the time. Usually it&#39;s regulars with a line for the counter out the door. But, gurl, I&#39;m tellin&#39; you. We got sit at the counter like we was somebody, and it felt great. Until the other obnoxious patrons showed up.<br><br>Pro Tip: The menu is on the wall. Much easier to update a few chalkboards than reprint menus daily.<br><br>Look, I could care less about what you think of the place. I adore it, and no amount of human stupid is going to change that. Yes, I tipped our counter waiter $10 even though he lost our bill and had to wait on other demanding idiots. He was doing his best given the circumstances.<br><br>Now I want cole slaw.	1
This place came really highly recommended, so my husband and I were really excited to try it last weekend. Unfortunately, we had a terrible experience. We had a 10pm reservation; arrived on time, and were seated at a table in the middle of the restaurant. Service was a little slow, but we had our wine and it was Saturday night, so that was okay. We ordered the escargot and the sweet breads to start. The escargot were a little rubbery, but the garlic-y tomato sauce it was served in was excellent - the best thing we had all night. The sweet breads were fine on their own, but the sauce they were served with was too salty and totally overpowered the dish. We ordered the beef heart and the pork and clams for our entrees, but our server returned more than a little while later to tell us that they were out of beef heart. They were also out of the oxtail, but they managed to tell us about that before we ordered (we were told that they accidentally left it out all night, which doesn&#39;t inspire a lot of confidence!). So, we got the quail instead. Both entrees were extremely disappointing. The pork and clams was basically a mound of vinegar-y pulled pork covered with a layer of powdered parmesan cheese, and a handful of dry, flavorless clams. The dish not only looked unappetizing, but tasted really odd - very salty and heavy. The quail was overcooked and tough, and the sauce it was served on was overly sweet and really grainy (this seemed like a technical cooking error) - really unappetizing. The worst part, and what made us put down our forks after only a handful of bites of each dish, was that there was hair in our food! Both dishes! Actually, that wasn&#39;t even the worst part. The worst part of the experience was that our server and the host, who I believe is the chef/owner, pretty much ignored us once our entrees were served. We sat, food untouched, in the middle of the restaurant, for about 30 minutes before our server came to check on us. When we told her (in a polite and diplomatic way) how disappointed we were with the meal, she apologized and quickly whisked the dishes away. She didn&#39;t offer to bring us anything else or show us a dessert menu (I was still hungry! It was 11:30pm and I had barely had dinner!). And then she didn&#39;t come back! After about 20 minutes, because we had to leave to catch a show, my husband finally went to find her (again, this is a tiny place). She told us that they would comp the meal, which we appreciated, but it would have been much better if she, or the chef/owner, would have actually came to our table to tell us that. Overall, I got the impression that once they knew something was wrong in the kitchen, or with our experience, they decided to ignore us. Whether that was because it&#39;s such a small place, and they didn&#39;t want other diners to pick up on it, or because it was late and they had pretty much given up on service, I don&#39;t know. Bad food is one thing, but bad food paired with rude, inconsiderate service is unacceptable. We will not be returning to HB.	0
The best sushi possible at this price point! Made by japanese bare hands. Long wait line sometimes, but always worth it. I can&#39;t recommend this place enough. I also recommend eating at the bar. The sushi nigiri style is tops. Green muscles are fantastic. Favorite nigiri would have to be the halibut with ponzu sauce. <br>Lastly, you can request to drink while you wait ;)<br>I&#39;d eat here everyday if god would let me.	1
Came here after reading reviews. Arrived at 9pm on Sunday and three main smoked meats were already sold out, very disappointed. Way too much vinegar in the collard greens. The meats for tender but way overpriced.	0
I really wanted to like this place, but I just don&#39;t think it&#39;s meant to be. The first time I came in here with my boyfriend during brunch hours and was very excited about the menu. We sat at a high top near the bar and the bartenders were in deep conversation for 5-10 minutes, no one even offered us a menu until I asked a patron at the bar if he was done with his. Another few minutes go by and no one has acknowledged us - so we got up and left.<br><br>I tried it again with a friend after work one night, and unfortunately was disappointed again. We got a cocktail and ordered the shrimp po&#39; boys and fried green tomatoes. I&#39;m from the south and know how great these items should be. All of it sounded so delicious per the description from the menu, but once we got our food it was some of the most bland I have ever eaten. The chefs clearly did not understand what seasoning was.<br><br>Obviously others have had better experiences, but with the multitude of places competing for my limited funds, I will be passing on this from now on.	0
Ono was wonderful, as was the service.  Great as usual.  Love coming to AquaKnox.  Look forward to it every trip.	1
New place. Great vibe. Great food. Really enjoyed the Hawaiian Bowl. Lots of chicken and rice and some super tasty sauce. I will be back.	1
In honor of Small Business Saturday, we took a trip to West 3rd Street to hit up some local businesses and check it out. We stopped in Toast for a light lunch and were delighted with our experience! <br><br>I ordered the Toast salad (1/2 portion is a perfect size) and it was wonderful! It consists of mixed greens, pine nuts, sundried tomatoes, beets, and goat cheese. The balsalmic dressing ties it all together and the flavors are outstanding. If I lived nearby I&#39;m sure this would be my staple dish.<br><br>My boyfriend ordered a chicken sandwhich (can&#39;t remember the name) which had avocado and cheese and some other yummy things. He chose french fries as his side and they were really good! Very cripsy, not too greasy, not overly salted...I&#39;m definitely a fan of the fries. <br><br>I love the ambiance and decor. The candy in jars along the wall is really cute and the pastry selections looked scrumptious! Our order arrived pretty quickly, making this the perfect lunch stop for a busy day of shopping.	1
I left here pretty disappointed.<br><br>The only reason why I gave them 2 stars was because of the decor and friendly staff.<br><br>We ordered a few sushi rolls, tuna tataki, spicy conch salad...and everything tasted so......NOT fresh =/	0
worst service....never again	0
Brickhouse was my favorite lunch spot for years (been coming here since 2005). The Brickhouse melt was THE best sandwich in SoMA. Sadly, it has been purged with the new menu. Tried the Wagyu burger today, with sweet potato fries. Several problems with the lunch; the lettuce was limp/wilting, and onions soggy/limp. The buns were burnt. the burger wasn't anything special. It was juicy, I'll give them that, but there wasn't much flavor for the ensemble as a whole. (served dry w/no sauce) The fries were overcooked, dry and on the edge of burnt. All said, for 20+ bucks (I had cheese for an extra buck, with tip $25 total), I'd rather eat an Umami. New menu + higher prices + poorer quality = Brickhouse has jumped the shark :(	0
Went here today on a whim and boy am I glad I did!! The decor is really unique and casual, makes for a really comfortable atmosphere. Yes, this is not a fine dining restaurant, but it is very clean and the food is very tasty. Not to mention the staff was very friendly and easy to talk to. My friend and I had the midnight in the garden pizza, garlic, marinara, goat cheese, mozzarella red onion, basil and fresh tomatoes. The crust was on the thin side, not greasy at all and had a nice crunch to it. Pizza done very well. Can't wait to go back and try more!!	1
Okay its a pizza, and that means I am going to be tough. However, I think I am getting soft, or its just too cold to be mean. This is not pizza in the sense of NYC or North Jersey pizza. It is pizza in relation to Dominos or Papa Johns, in fact it is better than both and why I gave it three stars. It is a meaty crust and as such, it can handle toppings. The cheese is not a fresh creamy mozzarella or a buffalo mozzarella, it is just the standard pizza chain pizza cheese, rubbery and bland. However, Glass Nickel is a better pizza than those national chains. I would recommend ordering a pizza with a lot of toppings and extra cheese. You will be pleased.	0
Casa Juan is pretty lucky to be where it is - in the only shopping center it takes you less than 15 minutes to drive to from Blue Lagoon during lunch. <br><br>That&#39;s really the only competitive advantage this place has because the Cuban food is below average, and the prices above average. I had a palomilla, and while the steak was OK (just OK) the white rice - my favorite thing to eat in a Cuban restaurant - was utterly flavorless. This plate was also $1-2 more than I&#39;m used to paying at La Carreta, which has far superior food.<br><br>If you don&#39;t have any other options you could do worse, and at the very least I found the service to be quick and attentive if you need to get in and out quickly for lunch.	0
4.5 stars (simply b/c of if location)<br><br>I love everything that is happening in the Midtown area, so much that my offices are located in the heart of it (Midblock). There are great new restaurants in the area, including some of the latest additions like Cheese Course, Sugarcane, and the &#34;no fail&#34; spots like Michael&#39;s Genuine Food. Even with this growing list of options, I sometimes crave an old school, simple, inexpensive, and oversized sub with all the trimmings (ala Substantial for those Miami natives who understand the need). This spot is about 7 blocks west of NE 29th and North Miami Ave in a commercial/business zone close to Allapatah so don&#39;t expect beauty, and a possible serenade from the drunk dudes in the back is included. Forget the baguette, and no freakin paninis here, just fresh, good ole fashion subs off the grill. Imagine lunch for well under $10. Family run, quick, and damn good!	1
Wow this place is incredible! Peaceful atmosphere amazing food and really nice service. I think I found a new favorite!	1
They claim that the Pantry has been open nonstop and without a customer for over 75 years. This isn't true. They were shut down two years ago for a day when the health department was appalled by what they found. Ironic, Richard Riordan owns a majority stake in this L.A. landmark and even he couldn't prevent the shutdown. Opening a day later, having scraped the yellow off the ceiling and moved the trash bins away from the griller, the Pantry is one of Los Angeles's best institutions. A strong, believable rumor has it that the waiters are all ex-cons. This may or not be true, but they've all been there for decades. Lifer waiters are hard to find. But this place is the tops for a great diner steak. Go for breakfast and load up with pancakes, eggs, and bacon. With a grill that's been going nonstop for so long, everything is saturated with a rich, savory flavor. It's a dive, a greasy spoon, and it's perfect. Your typical dinner starts with homemade sourdough bread and coleslaw made from scratch. Dinner comes with the vegetable of the day and a side of glorious potatoes. They do other dishes, but who wants stroganoff when you can have steak for $13?	1
Fred 62 is a legend, is an institution known to everybody in town and most of the tourists, which come to Fred as a part of their vacation. Young, old, day, night, I mean, everybody at anytime goes to Fred:) The menu is overwhelmingly big, but in a good way, so you can always find something for yourself any time of the day or night. I love the vegetarian/vegan options, like tofu chilaquiles, salads and burritos - all substitute with tofu! Plus veggie burger, veggie sandwich, and tons 24/7 breakfast items. I love lunches and brunches there, it really tastes so much better when you are not rushing to work! My latest experience was crucial, because I had to return my noodle dish since it completely did not reflect what I wanted to eat. And much too my embarrassment, it wasn't a big deal and I was able to order something else, just like my friend, who exchanged her salad for with no chicken. It sucks you can't drink outside, but inside you can freely enjoy mimosas for two:)	1
Best burgers. Overall awesome food.	1
I came here late at night for music/dancing. Music was good, atmosphere okay and service was the worst I've experienced in my life. Everytime I went up to get a drink it took at least 20 minutes. The worst was when I had been waiting for about 20 minutes when a guy comes next to me is served immediately. When finally the bartender is getting my drink, another guy comes up next to me orders a drink and receives it before I even receive mine. I can't make this stuff up. Worst. Service. Ever.	0
the eagle rock location is further away from me and doesn't have as big a parking lot. it also is busier at that location. this location is just as good as the original. tasty burgers no matter which one you get and great beers. never have trouble parking and awesome staff who work there. suggested one of the best oatmeal stouts I have had. you have to go here.	1
I used to eat spicy beef noodles for breakfast and lunch almost every single day while living in China. After a bit of yelping, I trekked over to Lao Bei Fang with high expectations, but found the noodle soup (beef and tendon, #27) disappointing. <br><br>Service was fast and you get a HUGE portion for $5.50, so the price is right. Unfortunately, I could barely make it halfway through before feeling like the grease was congealing in my stomach. I have no problem with grease when a dish is worth it, but the broth itself was pretty flat, with little dimension beyond the initial saltiness. They were generous with the toppings but the beef was average - reasonably so though, considering the price. Same with the noodles, fresh and homemade, but far from the best I&#39;ve had. <br><br>TLDR: Come to this bare-bones joint if you want to fill up on a hearty meal and free tea, but don&#39;t go out of your way expecting a culinary epiphany or hole-in-the-wall gem. <br><br>I&#39;ll update if I ever come back to try the dumplings!	0
Yes, the decor is very pleasant and home like. At 2:30 on a Saturday afternoon this place was bumping. My girls table of three sat down and ordered our mimosas and bloody mary&#39;s a few minutes later. We were in a great mood.<br><br>About 10 minutes later we ordered our entrees. Then we waited. and waited and waited.. No drinks. Our food comes out about 20 minutes later and we had to wave our server down because still, we hadn&#39;t received our drinks. Honestly, at this point, the restaurant had emptied out a bit being it was 3pm. I have never waited this long for a drink. Pretty absurd if you ask me.<br><br>I ordered the heritage pork benedict and I can appreciate the dish but I don&#39;t think the menus describes it well at all. I like lean meats and this was not lean and was also EXTREMELY deep fried. Extremely. So it looked like a hash brown and therefore the pork served as the english muffin which i was eagerly looking forward to.<br><br>I agree I would have been much happier if I had ordered something else, but considering the lack of service, our apathetic waiter, and it not being a cheap place, I am not coming back here any time soon.	0
Their balsamic-glazed brussel sprouts are utterly addictive, and something I'd go back for over and over again. They come in a bowl, separated into chips rather than halved brussel sprouts. Every bite is crispy, slightly sweet, and utterly addictive.The Little Bear Burger, at $15, comes with a side of fries or a salad. Burgers with some element of sweet fruit are one of my favorite combinations, and this one's done pretty well with a great cherry gastrique.	1
I came here and got one of the lunch combos. I got 5 pieces of chicken, a choice of rice or fries, salad and some pickled radish. I chose the original chicken, but I would love to come back and try the honey one. The original chicken was delicious and incredibly satisfying. It was not greasy at all. The batter was light and crunchy. It had a nice peppery kick to it. I almost wish I didn't get the lunch combo and just stuck to the chicken. Go check this place out!	1
The history of this place and location I want to give this place an outstanding review so bad. I want to say the food and experience at this cool location is worth the price. BUT I cannot. The buffet is mediocre and you have to go early or you will feel like you are a buzzard eating what&#39;s left over. It seems the food at pollo tropical is fresher then this buffet (especially after the lunch rush). <br>I know our group will have lunch here again if there is no other option. <br>What a disappointment...again	0
Good salads pizza and atmosphere. It's fun to watch the team of two cooperatively prepare the personal pizzas with admirable speed in front of the signature oven. Take home. Even better the next day.	1
Came with a friend the other night and we had dinner here. :)<br><br>We walked in and after a few minutes of not noticing us, they saw us and cleaned a table immediately for us. <br><br>They have some nice dinner combos, so I ordered one with sashimi and chicken. Portions are pretty big, and the food was good! You can&#39;t really go wrong with chicken teriyaki (or you shouldn&#39;t), and the fish was fresh too! And it was all topped off with some green tea ice cream. :)<br><br>If you&#39;re looking for something simple and solid, I&#39;d suggest coming to Oomasa!	1
This place is okay. Good drinks. This is a place you come to for a drink and then move on.	1
I enjoyed my breakfast here. The location is a little shady, but they have a nice outdoor seating area. They made me an amazing soy chai latte. I got the scrambled tofu with veggie sausage and it was also very good. I appreciated that they had egg free breakfast options; a lot of places don't. The service was good and the prices were reasonable. The only thing I didn't appreciate was the people at the table next to us had two little dogs that started barking loudly.	1
My family and I ate at Faro for our Christmas dinner. The restuarant was beautiful, the staff was very friendly, and the food was delicious. A little expensive, perhaps, for just a &quot;let's go out for dinner&quot; spot, but perfect for a special occasion and the food was well worth the money. The desserts from Modern Pastry were also fantastic.	1
I loved it here....<br><br>I was staying across the street at Hardrock and wandered over....being a huge Yaki Niku fan I figured it was worth a try....I realized right away they were not Japanese but that&#39;s not important these days...the quality of the meat was good and the service was amazing...<br><br>I asked the waiter for atsukan....and he had no idea...so I told him it means hot sake...I was in one of those moods....I did send back a few pieces of the tongue they sent me, however the chef then replaced my tongue order and in addition made me another chefs special dish on the house....my friend and I left full of wagyu beef....happy...and maybe $60 lighter....which is a deal, given we were drinking...	1
One of my favorite late night eateries.<br><br>You can&#39;t come here during the day...it&#39;s overcrowded and for some reason the food tastes better late night (probably just me). anyways its conveniently open til 4am i think..perfect if you live in downtown la or the nearby areas or if you&#39;re coming back from the clubs and you have the munchies ;o) <br><br>I always get pork chops and eggs...and always ask for the sourdough bread to be toasted...it tastes extra scrumptious and more fatty. haha. im getting fat.	1
So I have heard legends of this place over the years. That lines stretch out the door because the food is so good. I was in the area so I had to try it out. It's open 24/7 which is pretty cool. They do not accept credit/debit which might be a problem for some of you. The atmosphere is pretty casual. Very old-fashioned which is pretty cool since so many of these types of places try to conform to modern looks. They have pictures on the walls of historic events and people of Los Angeles. Now the food. I ordered the French toast which was $6.25. They give you three thick whole slices unlike Denny's which gives you one and a half, sometimes two; but Denny's serves hash brown and eggs alongside the toast, The Pantry does not. The meal was not that good. Not terrible but not fantastic. I had a metallic type taste with it. Maybe it was the silverware. The bread wasn't warm. It didn't have a freshly cooked taste not feel. The butter is not the nice whipped butter you get at other restaurants. It comes in slices that you peel off paper, and it was given to me cold. So maybe I need to try something else from there, but if you can't get simple French toast right, I don't trust anything else you have.	0
Came here for brunch on Memorial day. They were obviously understaffed and heard one of the servers talking about it. Saw two customers storm out because they had been sitting and hadn't seen anyone come by to take drink orders or anything for awhile. Well we gave them the benefit of the doubt and sat. We REALLY wanted sweet potato fries, but they were out, BOO!The server seemed anxious and wayyy too busy. We ordered the "demon eggs" and spinach dip for appetizers. The demon eggs were NOTHING special, supposedly there is crab in them? The spinach dip was good but comes with way too salty way too hard bread. My boyfriend got eggs benedict florentine with hashbrown (the square kind you just buy from the store). He said it was nothing special. I ordered the chicken avocado salad sandwich, pretty yummy I must say. Probably the best food of our meal. All in all, it was definitely "meh"	0
This is maybe my fourth one star review for this place. It's amazing how this place continues to disappoint. The list of negatives keeps growing. This one focuses on the food. Their dishes are simply uninspiring. This place belongs in the lobby of a hotel. Where there is a certain degree of fakeness and you know your being taken advantage of. So many great places in Madison not sure why anyone would pick this place.	0
I think this is fine to go to for drinks and starters to sit outside on their very nice patio, but we had dinner here and were disappointed. The steak comes with a sweet sauce that is not very good, the burger (mario style) is just okay, and the baked then fried potatoes are bland. The service is great though, and the gooey cake was pretty good. Good, laid back atmosphere.	0
I met up with a friend for lunch and the place was pretty quiet, which was nice. The waiter treated me like a weirdo for wanting a sandwich without bread. He acquiesced, proof that you can make gluten-free happen here. However, eating paleo/dairy-free/low-carb is nearly impossible.<br><br>Verdict: The food tasted good and I might come back, but would probably end up preferring to try someplace new.	0
I&#39;ve been going to Oomasa as long as I can remember - my parents used to take me there as a small child - and it is still the same wonderful place it&#39;s always been. While the neighborhood around it glossies up and costs more and more, Oomasa stays constant, reasonably-priced, and delicious. To walk into Oomasa is to meet an unassuming, reliable old friend... who happens to serve you the freshest sushi in town.	1
It's small. It's messy. Probably over-priced. Trendy. You won't feel filled up. And you absolutely have to do it once. Because the Original Ramen Burger is the most enjoyable thing that has almost ruined my dress that I've eaten. It's not for everybody: that ramen bun really does come undone almost as soon as you take a bite: not a problem for us as we ordered it at Lock & Key and just returned it to our plates and navigated the rest with a knife and fork. If you opt not to eat it at Lock & Key (it is not more expensive there, though, so why wouldn't you?), you will have to take it home, because otherwise there is nowhere to eat it. Counter staff is friendly. Parking is easiest in the residential neighborhood behind, as long as you get there before the nightlife starts. My mouth is having a happy memory, and I am actually smelling it right now even though I'm a week out. Man: anything that sticks like that is worth coming back for!	1
Slooooooooow service. And as overpriced as they come	0
Such bad service! Went here earlier with friends and received the worst service! Such rude, cold waiters... Got the wrong food and an argument as the main course. Not returning here again..	0
Was in the mood for some deli treats...<br>Ordered the pastrami on rye and matzo ball soup. Cheers to tradition, culture and history but just wasn&#39;t my cup-a tea. Had better of both dishes...<br><br>I will say that I can easily get obsessed with their pickles... hell of a good pickle! =) and I&#39;d like to go back and try the freshly made cookies and pastries...	0
I had dinner with friends and the ambiance was perfect for our gathering.  the food service was timely, and our server Meredith along with the support staff were very attentive and friendly. I look forward to my next visit! Shae R.	0
Purbird--where the lady behind the counter will gladly tell you that she won&#39;t put your order in because it&#39;s too much to eat for one person--and you should listen to her even though you think you can down it all. <br><br>If it&#39;s your first time and you&#39;re hungry, get the grilled chicken with the sauces. I liked the purbird sauce, zucchini and chutney. If you&#39;re not as hungry, get the chicken breast sammich. Both of these choices, with a side of jalapeno mash..... it&#39;ll haunt you in your sleep. <br><br>I wasn&#39;t a big fan of the whole wheat mac and cheese... something about whole wheat in my cheesy greasy goodness just doesn&#39;t seem right. Also wasn&#39;t a big fan of the chicken burger--it was good, but the patty absorbed too much grease, which over powered everything else in the burger.	1
I am ruined for all other pizza.	1
This place was pretty busy on a Thursday night, and my friend and I had to wait around 25 minutes for a table. It's a relatively large place, though, so the wait is better than it would have been at someplace like Restaurant Komasa. I was craving zaru soba (I know, this is a sushi place ... but that's what I was craving!), and it was not good. I had to ask for grated daikon, and the noodles were just whatever. The sushi, however, is amazing. My friend had the philadelphia roll, and while I don't normally like cream cheese my sushi, the salmon was thick and fresh, the asparagus was cooked perfectly, and the cream cheese really worked! I was in shock. Also delicious were the salmon skin roll and the scallop sushi. I will definitely be back for more.	1
After hearing so much about Lola and seeing the delicious Yelp photos, my friend and I decided to have breakfast here one grey Seattle morning.	1
I will say, the people here are really nice, someone is usually there to open the door, which is nice. The food is also excellent. BUT, it is unnecessarily expensive. The quality of the meat isn&#39;t really that great, so I don&#39;t understand the charge of six dollars for extra meat. It&#39;s essentially chicken kitchen, but with steak and flavored chickens. A burrito with steak runs you about 11 dollars, and they charge for sour cream. A bowl queen chicken and steak, 15?! That&#39;s a full meal at chili&#39;s or Flanigans. Again, the taste and service is good, but it&#39;s not even Moes or chipotle quality, so it&#39;s definitely not worth the extra premium. I won&#39;t go back.	0
So yummy! Hamachi ceviche: yummy but it worth the $19, el pastor nachos: delicious, pork belly carnitas tacos: perfectly cooked pork belly, Baja fish taco: very sweet.	1
This place has got something special all of the burgers I have tried so far have just been mouth watering perfection.I do warn that they serve there meat rare so if you do not like pink in your patty then make sure to ask them to cook it medium.I will go again for sure.	1
We've eaten in once and ever since have been lazy bums ordering delivery. It's in the neighborhood and therefore really close but on nights like tonight (no energy it's raining outside insert-any-excuse-here...) the fact that Chef Liao offers delivery is a major bonus.	1
A Madison tradition?	0
Ordered a small caramel cappuccino today which was not tasty at all. Too much syrup so I could not drink it. 3.75 for a small coffee in this neighborhood is too expensive. The only good thing was that I got my money back. This happens when people think everyone could make a good coffee.	0
Good Pizza, good beer (we got the tasting flight) and a laid back atmosphere makes this place enjoyable and totally passable for a pie on a weeknight. Supremely limited hours (like, 4 hours a day? what a work schedule!) but it&#39;s worth it if you&#39;ve got the hankering for neighborhood pizza. <br><br>Bartenders/owners? were a bit non-responsive. They didn&#39;t bother greeting us when we came in, we found our own seats and had to actively ask them for menus, beers, and eventually our pizzas. Hopefully they get better in the future cause the food is pretty good.	1
Been waiting over an hour for delivery. When inquiring, they say they don&#39;t have Brussels Sprout app. So basically they haven&#39;t gotten to my order yet. Said very busy. I get it, it&#39;s a holiday. But I love across the street.	0
If you like be screamed at by illiterate rood Chinese servers who barely speak English when they screw up your order and get bitchy when they have to correct their mistake - then eat here. <br><br>This place is overrated. It was complete chaos in this joint as customers were bickering while pushing and shoving to grab tables. I was willing to let the terrible service fly, but the dumplings were salty, chewy and thick. I&#39;ve had much better and not much difference in price.<br><br>Skip this place. There are much better cheap eats nearby.	0
I found Far Bar on accident, while wandering around Little Tokyo district one summer evening with a friend. It's nice to stumble upon a place like this, and feel like you have found a secret hideaway. Clearly, this place is no secret, as there are 500-odd reviews prior to mine, but the mood of this place makes you feel that way, which is nice. We just stopped here for a couple of beers and there was a huge selection to choose from. I went with a Belgian selection (natch) and was pleased enough to stay for the ambiance. Very much charmed by the appearance of this little spot.As you wind through the small entrance which seems like a side door, sort of a speakeasy feel, as it opens up into an open to the air alley with small lights strung across the open space between buildings. At the back wall of this alley space there was a small plinth that looks to be a stage area, at this time there was a DJ providing moody mellow atmosphere tunes. Also some kind of vintage film was projected on the back wall. This could have gone the cheesy direction, if not executed well, but it really was. Cool. If you continue to the left, there is seating inside, and a bar, further on through the building and there seems to be more restaurant space beyond. They were hosting some sort of beer tasting event at the time. Another "win". The staff were nice and had a good balance of attentiveness, and knowing when you are content to be left alone.A quick scan of the menu showed me the kind of Japanese-pub food fusion that made me want to return another time, when I am hungry. Really? Japanese inspired dishes AND Belgian beer? Somebody pinch me.	1
chivitos are the way to go here. currently byob	1
I am so happy to see this place open in Downtown Miami, conveniently located across from my apartment :) <br><br>I have been here 2 times. Each time the items we ordered were excellent. LOVED the strawberry kiwi cupcake and their lattes where strong but not bitter. Why 4 stars? Well, I want them to stay open and I think their prices are bit too high for the area. I don&#39;t think downtown is ready to pay these prices (yet).<br><br>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;d totally be back. But I will totally consider my budget before paying $9 for a small cupcake and 2 lattes.	1
Yowza. That pig is good.<br><br>I do remember wanting some more pickle action or something acidic to break up the flavor, but pretty damn good sandwich. And the hazelnut mousse cookies are insane. Not so much for the bacon caramels...<br><br>BUT THE PORK IS SO TASTY. Worth the $$$ once in a while for sure.	1
Ridiculous! This must be the torture a parent goes through when asked which child they love more. Unless you ask my parents. It is obvious I am the favorite. I love both of these businesses so much and when it was announced that they would be doing a joint event, I jumped on the chance to be in one of the limited seats available.<br><br>Yonaka took lead with the menu and Snow Shavery played a vital part in elevating the dishes presented to us. We started with a palate cleanser of lemon shaved ice with frozen grapes. This was a treat during this blistering summer. Next was hamachi dish. I say that I don&#39;t like certain foods, but it never stops me from cleaning a plate. Hamachi is one of those fish I tend to shy away from, but good luck tearing the dish from me. The touch of grapefruit helped to mellow out the flavor. The fried bun with mixed seafood salad and fresh pickles were phenomenal. A group of us went back yesterday and it was added onto their happy hour menu. It is worth getting. The next two dishes helped put us all in a food coma. When they spoke about communal dining, I was not expecting a whole sea bass for every four individuals. If that was not enough than a plate of pork belly for every six made me want to take a nap. The fennel and apple slaw that accompanied the fish was amazing. I could eat a whole plate of that by itself. The citrus and pears paired well with the fattiness of the pork belly. I was ready to tap out until the dessert came out. Chocolate ganache with three kinds of strawberries, fried milk, and green tea snow was deadly. I ate mine and began devouring those around me. At the end of our three hour meal, I could not think about food again for the rest of the day. <br><br>Thank you Yonaka staff for staying until 5am to set up and turning around to serve us at 11am. Thank you Will and Mike, from Snow Shavery, you do produce the best product in Vegas. I cannot wait until the brick and mortar opens up in Chinatown.	1
Convenient location! Love their selection of draft beer and it's appropriately priced (6-7 for a pint). Also really like their selection of toppings and extras. You fill out a little paper menu check list. Super easy and simplified- we walked right in and instantly went to work without anyone telling us how. Turn your individual menu into your server and your good. Food was great. Turkey burger was nice and juicy- full of flavor. meal with one beer, burger and fries ended up being around 18.50 before tip. It's a very bright place with a large patio. The inside is very modern and has really high ceilings with a lofty feel. Overall, I would say the food was great but there are so many great LA burger bars that are so similar to this one. I would definitely go here if it's convenient to you!	1
I had my first ever Malt experience. I love chocolate shakes, now I love chocolate malts! Had a great fun experience and enjoyed the unique-edgy menu.	1
Likely the best samgyetang (Chicken Ginseng soup) restaurant in LA. Great for lunch/dinner.<br>If you&#39;re feeling sick, hangover, etc- you definitely need to get a hot bowl of samgyetang. It has many health benefits too. The soup is superrrr hot (usually burns my tongue so becareful!!) but inside the bowl it has a whole (small) chicken stuffed with ginseng, garlic, ginger, sticky rice, etc and it&#39;s also served with rice. You can dip the tender chicken in the salt and it&#39;ll definitely tingle your taste buds. It&#39;s a bit pricy but definitely aLOT of food, more than enough to fill you up! Tastes homemade and clean.	1
A Hollywod classic.LOVE IT!A must stop for everyone.	1
Not serving breakfast 5 minutes past 3. Out of many items on the menu. Chicken sandwich dry. Bread falling apart. Bacon way to salty<br><br>So we arrived at BLD for a late breakfast, we walked in at 3pm and when we sat down we where told that breakfast is over at 3pm. Usually i would i understand if the place is busy, but it was EMPTY! Maybe 4 groups of people where inside at the time. So now since where are already sitting down, and hungry we decide to settle for something else of the menu, somehow everything we chose was sold out? We ended up ordering something just to get the day going, and we where very unsatisfied. I DO NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE WASTE THEIR TIME AND MONEY!	0
My craveburger was loaded with chunks of grizzle which is totally unacceptable. In a highly competitive industry, putting out an inferior product, means you're not getting my hard earned money anymore. Good luck.	0
This bar strikes a great balance between casual dive bar and quaint cocktail lounge. Tucked into a nearly invisible alley in Little Tokyo, it boasts very knowledgeable, skilled and attentive bartenders who will NOT give you a drink you don't enjoy. They will let you sample, if necessary, and they follow up to make sure you like what you have. They usually offer really fun specials that showcase the diversity of their stock (in May, for example, they offered a tequila flight for $15, featuring a number of interesting, quality tequilas). They also happen to be one of few places that occasionally stock cherry brandy.PLUS: They serve great bar food: wasabi fries, sushi and chicken wings, among others.	1
Okay-- to summarize:- Great outdoor ambiance- Fun electro music - Good drinks- Fun Bartenders- Delicious Happy Hour (chicken wings, garlic wasabi fries!)- Super close (to me)I'd like to think of this place as "my local bar" :p	1
We waited 40 minutes before we were served our first drink. The waiter told us the ticket fell behind the register...ok, I get it, these things happen, but in my view they typically warrant a comped round of drinks.As this obviously cut into our time there, our party was stunned when the manager came over and told us the the next party with a reservation would be arriving soon, and were really excited for their table, our table.I understand blocking set amounts of time for reservations, but to literally kick a party of 3 out that ran a tab of over $180 is appalling.When I mentioned Yelp, she proceeded to apologize and told me she didn't mean to kick us out, but just to give us a heads up. I guess she meant a heads up that were were "going" to be kicked out.Food was good, but just "good", but nothing many of the 1,900 reviews claim as being the most amazing soul food experience ever.	0
I met a friend here for breakfast. I should have known by the bland interior decorating (and the fact I'd heard this was a chain) not to order the huevos rancheros, but I love them, so I couldn't stop myself.	0
Pickles with a smack of garlic and psychedelic ceilings 24 hours a day? It was about midnight as I sat down among whatever crowd Thursday night brought this total throwback to the mid-1900s. 1930-something to be exact, and I was THERE, last night! So glad I didn&#39;t need those 1.21 jigowatts[sic].<br><br>But I did need food. I realized something about Canter&#39;s on Yelp: no ones gonna read all 42 reviews! Here&#39;s a checklist for you skimmers:<br><br>1) Toasted rye Reuben with pastrami, sub chips with fries<br>2) Free pickles with garlic flava<br>3) If you dig it, Matzo ball soup <br>4) Some crazy lady swears by the grilled cheese<br>5) Parking doesn&#39;t exist during peak hours<br>6) The ceiling<br>7) People watching for white after Labor Day. Faux pas!<br><br>This is worth a visit or four, and many more for those late nights. Enjoy yourself!	1
I've ordered twice from this restaurant: once in person and once for delivery.	0
This is what the grilled cheese my mom made while mad at me tasted like. Sure, it&#39;s a cute touch to fold napkins the way the sandwich is cut, but somehow they managed to burn the one grilled cheese they made during the lunch rush. Nice guy working the Madison Square Eats 2013 during lunchtime took my card when I asked to pay with Square for my Classic Cheddar and that alone was an adventure, taking multiple tries and devices to process the 7 freaking dollars for my sandwich (better off since it took a long time for said food to emerge from the panini press).	0
Iam in love with my waiter!!! Desmon u are amazing ! I'm a very difficult customer but he made my night! Such a sweetheart! He was so polite and professional .Only coming back for him !	1
I&#39;ve been here twice for dinner, and both times it was a great experience. I love that it&#39;s secluded and if you blink, you&#39;ll miss it. The ambiance is fantastic, low lights, nice staff. Great for a b-day dinner with friends, a romantic evening with that special someone. I like that the service was kind of slow. I hate feeling rushed at a restaurant.<br><br>I can&#39;t remember too much about the food because I was drinking. I do remember whatever red wine I had, it was good. I&#39;m definitely going back...	1
LA&#39;s oldest and dopest. When it comes to pancakes and breakfast period yo. Dinner is equally as bomb but I come for the breakfast hands down. Despite the hipster influx that plagues this great city this icon has managed to sustain it&#39;s integrity. Come here expecting to wait in most days. And yes you guessed it the reason for the four stars is cash only. Booooo!! Lol	1
My girlfirend and I went there the other night. What a lovely spot with delicious food. We had no expectations since they just opened but left with full beliies and smiles on our face. We had the mozzerella appetizer in addition to the salmon carpaccio (yum). We shared a pasta and a meat entree, both very worthy. I highly recommend.	1
I ordered takeout and waited really long for food. prob 20 mins from time it was suppose to be ready.	0
I visited this place by myself. It was a lonely time. I looked at my face in the reflection of my menu and began to sob. I ordered the chicken cutlets with korean sauce. Apparently korean sauce = ketchup. The chicken was not salty enough so I cried on it. Still though, I would only give this place 5 stars after stumbling upon it in a post-apocalyptic scenario.	0
Order omelette with pork sausage. Gave me chicken sausage. Insisted that its pork. Otherwise, okay place with typical diner choices. Service slow and inattentive!	0
Delish!! Go there now	1
To be accurate, this review should rank between 2 and 3 stars. After several visits to this new entry to Madison's self actualized near east side, I have good news and bad news. The good news is that certain aspects of this loud but well meaning neighborhood bar are worth repeating as a customer, while others are not. The bad news is that, those aspects not worth repeating happen at unexpected and seemingly random intervals. Most recently, I visited with a fellow burger aficionado (I had based my enthusiastic expectations on my previous visit). Sadly, those expectations were dashed on this occasion, as the staff was clearly in over their head in handling the large overflow of customers. After seeing no food for ONE HOUR AND TEN MINUTES, we were extended several complimentary drinks from the bar. The burger itself, was more pedestrian than I remembered (my friend was not especially impressed). It must be made clear at this point that the menu is broad and worth exploring, but the most recent experience caused me to realize that until they are able to handle their weekend crush, a lower priority weeknight will likely be when I next visit, which I will review as an update.	1
spring cab miami . dont take this cab!!! my business partner took it today from miami airport to biscayne and the 100 st. after nearly hit a truck they ask the driver if he wanted they drive . he was so stone he was not able to keep his eyes open. hello!!!!	0
Food was not even good! The girls were nice however this guy server if your going to try to flirt with my dude don&#39;t make it obvious and plus he&#39;s team vagina so back off end of rant won&#39;t be back	0
This is one of my favorite spots in DTLA. Most every night, they have live music on the deck outside the restaurant level with a view of the skyscrapers. Perfect ambience! <br><br>You&#39;re sure to take pics of that view and post &#39;em on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram.... just to show your friends whatever they&#39;re doing at that very moment isn&#39;t as good as what you&#39;re doing; you know how our subconscious evil innards will go off on tangents like that..<br><br>Haven&#39;t had full on sit down meals here yet but the appetizers and drinks with the ambience are worth the visit. Did split another pasta dish on one Happy Hour visit that was worth ordering again as well.<br><br>FYI, When you enter the building, you&#39;re greeted by personnel who guide you to the elevator, then when you arrive at an upper floor, are greeted again by another person who guides you to the next elevator so you can find your way.<br><br>Can&#39;t recommend parking since we&#39;ve never driven here...our condo is in walking distance and walk when we go here. I do know the Red Line train stops at Pershing Square that is half a block away so if you&#39;re drinking, take that train. (FREE ADVICE from this former firefighter/paramedic who has seen many nasty wrecks over his lifetime). <br><br>Perch is a great spot. I say check it out.	1
My sister in-law and her boyfriend were in town visiting and we found ourselves downtown without a dinner reservation. I haaaaate being downtown in general because the food tends to be overpriced and mediocre. But, thanks to Yelp, I found this place and we decided to walk over and check it out. <br><br>We came in at 7pm on a Saturday night and were told it would be just a few minutes. Great! We sat in the bar area while we waited for the rest of our party to join us. The server in the bar area was fabulous and we tried the &#34;Not Your Father&#39;s Root Beer&#34;. Yelpers, please listen: you MUST try it. It&#39;s amazing! It&#39;s root beer with a 10.7% kick. So good. <br><br>When the rest of our party arrived we were sat. We had a fabulous booth for our party of six that was separated from the dining room with a tied back curtain. The little alcove made it much easier for us all to hear each other at dinner. Excellent! <br><br>Our server explained that it&#39;s an open kitchen so the food will come out when it&#39;s ready so you might not get everything in an order you would prefer. That&#39;s fine though, it ensures your food is hot. <br><br>I ordered the fork and knife pastrami sandwich. I will be dreaming about that sandwich for a long time. It was perfect. <br><br>I sampled my sister in-law&#39;s mac and cheese and it was delicious. <br><br>The only hiccup in the whole meal was when the server was clearing our plates and noticed that my sister in-law had gotten the pork tenderloin sandwich instead of the prime rib. She hadn&#39;t even notice but he gave us a complimentary dessert and adjusted our bill. Amazing service! <br><br>I would not hesitate to recommend this place and my husband and I might very well make the trip back downtown specifically to go here for a date night.	1
Sardine is a unique place. Maybe it's the decor or the ambience, I don't know? I do however love the food here. The frites have always been good, they have a good selection of beers. The Mussels are a real hit here. Their is two places in Madison with great Mussels, Bonfyre and Sardine. I've had other menu items here, I don't recall the name of a sandwich that I had here but it was phenomenal. I've also had the Duck e0 l'Orange and it was hands down one of the best meals I've ever had. Sardine is a great place for a special occasion. Parking is easy and your right by the lake for a nice stroll after dinner.	0
My family and I love to eat out; in fact it's our bona fide hobby. And while we're a critical bunch, we all LOVE Porta Alba. My husband, my two sons (ages 8 and 12) clean our plates - and guilt free too. Porta Alba's fresh, nutritious ingredients are lovingly prepared and leave us feeling full, but not fat.	0
LOVED this place! Aside from the food being amazing, each plate was served in a unique way, cocktails were not watered down, and service was incredible. We came with a group of 5 people. 3 of them were visitors from Armenia, so it was very entertaining for them. The mac and cheese appetizer is a must-have! For dinner, i had the salmon, which was flavored and cooked perfectly. It came in a plate that had a decorated fish on it, it was so cute! Each plate had a unique twist to it. For dessert, we got the famous cotton candy and the churros! the churros were served with a chocolate sauce and i have never had a churros taste that good. I give this place 5 stars and will go back for sure!!	1
Very nice dishes. Very satisfied. Nice pot dishes. Big portions for the fired chicken rice. fried chicken chop was tender and juicy. Rice mixed very fragrant. Soups from pot were flavorings.	1
They do chowder right!	1
My boyfriend and I were just in L.A. on vacation for our anniversary. Our original plan was to go to Mexi Cali Tacos & Co. but they were closed. And we stumbled upon this hidden gem instead. The service was good. The place is small with limited seating. They offer a nice, delicious salsa bar and have restrooms on the side. Now the best part: the TACOS! my boyfriend had their fish tacos, which they advertise as "LA's best fish tacos" and we agreed. They were amazing! I had the al pastor tacos and damn, so good. I can't wait to go back to Hollywood just to stop here again. If you get the chance, definitely check this place out!!	1
Saturday at noon, driving around LA trying to find a place to have brunch that has parking, doesn&#39;t have a 2 hour wait and has some veg friendly options.<br>Accidentally stumbled upon Luna Park and was excited since I frequented Luna Park SF on a regular basis.<br>Cereal appetizer mix, which is awesome when you&#39;re so hungry you&#39;re considering eating the leftovers on the table next to you.<br>Had the mimosa&#39;s, which were a ridiculously good deal - like $1 or $2 until 3pm, so naturally we drank them as fast as our waitress would bring them [and she was on it!].<br>I had some amazing mexican nacho/scramble thing, it was an insane amount of food and was delicious. Had I not been so into devouring my food I could tell you what the people I was with had, but I don&#39;t think my eyes ever left my plate.<br>After mimosa time was over I had a strawberry mojito, and it was delicious.<br>Spoke with the owner, super nice, they just purchased it.. bartender was our server and she was great as well.<br>Will definitely be coming back	1
a 'ramen' bar with VERY LIMITED ramen options. i ordered the pork one. think i managed 3 mouthfuls. the calamari, on the other hand - prob one of the best i've ever had. in a strip mall. if it leaves a bad taste in your mouth - you can pop into the pinkberry across the street afterwards.:(	0
It was a amazing atmosphere for our group attending a concert. The food was quick and tasty.	1
5 Stars!!!!	0
Yum! Old school steak house. Great filet & drinks!	0
We were a group of 20 and everyone in our group really enjoyed Carmine's. It was great to order several salads and entrees and share them, because everything is served family style. The portions were very generous and worth the price when you consider that each dish served 3-4 people. The service and atmosphere were great too.	1
I&#39;m bummed this place was a wash. It&#39;s so close to home, and with a charming outdoor patio, wifi and TVs, I thought I&#39;d have to love it. Sadly, the staff was less than friendly, which made me likely to never return.<br><br>We stopped in to do some work and nurse a couple drinks. I went with a bloody mary, which had wayyyyyy too much worschestershire. My friend had a latte, which she said was fine. We thought about ordering some food, but we had recently eaten, so we went without. Our waitress was very attentive when trying to get our order, but seemed unhappy with us when we didn&#39;t order more.<br><br>At one point the manager, or someone, came out and told me to keep my dog on a shorter leash because he was blocking people. He wasn&#39;t particularly nice about it, at all. <br><br>All in all, we felt pretty uncomfortable here. It wasn&#39;t exactly a welcoming atmosphere, and I probably won&#39;t return. Damn shame!	0
I love the democratizing effect San (Korean for "mountain") has on its patrons. This hole in the wall is open 24 hours and you'll see people of all ages here, all enjoying authentic Korean comfort food. It's also one of the tiniest little rooms I've ever eaten in and it has trouble seating more than a dozen people at once. If you order takeout, just give them your name and your order will be ready for pickup in 15 minutes, complete with nicely packaged banchan all in a brown paper bag. The service here is just typical for a Korean restaurant - they're not really rude, but they're constantly busy so you have to assert yourself a bit.The menu isn't as limited as you might think (about a dozen dishes posted on the wall), but the star of the show is the jeonbokjuk (abalone porridge). If you eat in, they'll crack a raw egg on top, but if you order takeout, it doesn't include the egg. It's easily the best jeonbokjuk in town, only surpassed by homemade cooking. The samgyetang (ginseng chicken soup) is also popular, but I've never thought it was that great - the cornish hen doesn't seem all that fresh and didn't feel that tender or succulent either. San also has excellent banchan but there's only 4 dishes: a good pungent cabbage kimchi, ggakdugi (cubed radish) kimchi, jangjorim (beef boiled in soy sauce), and shredded pickled radish. You can tell the jangjorim is the real deal because if you've ever ordered takeout and saved the leftovers in the fridge, the soy sauce will gelatinize in the cold - indicative of quality stock.	1
My friend and I had the pho here which was HORRIBLE . It didn't taste very good and some of the meat was more on the raw side because the pho was not hot enough . This is the worst pho place I've ever been to . I ordered a side of garlic noodles because it seemed to be popular here but it was disappointing as well . The garlic noodles were super bland ... I had to add hot sauce to it for it to taste decent . The beef carpaccio was actually not bad though . I will not be back here again ...	0
We eat sushi here about once a month but last night the sushi and service were both disappointing. We waited about 5 min for anyone to come greet and seat us. Once we were seated in one of their cubicles, we waited another 15 min for a waitress to come greet us.. Then she forgot our beer. Our cold sushi was warm and our hot eel came out cold.	1
Great place for lunch in what seems like the heart of the financial district here in NYC. They have many different options fitting every taste-including Sprinkles Cupcakes for dessert! Vietnamese to Sushi to Italian to Mexican food and more. You won&#39;t go hungry!<br><br>Only downside was its relatively high volume of people, but prices are as comparable as you&#39;ll find around this district and this entire city for sure.	1
This place has fallen from greatness and with great breakfasts all over Ballard I am surprised to see any line at all. My wife and I regularly enjoyed breakfast at the University location when we were in college. This was before the new locations when the wait could take 45 minutes to an hour. We loved it so we willingly did the time. However we moved out of the U-district and in doing so our thoughts of the Portage Bay cafe were lost. Fast-forward to the present. We had attempted to eat at the Ballard location on two prior dates but the line was imposing and we were bringing family from out of the city who are not accustomed to waiting. Saturday we finally woke up early enough to get in. It appears on Saturdays before 9	0
I don&#39;t understand why so many positive reviews. <br><br>Went to Maccheroni Republic with 3 friends on a Saturday night, and we were welcomed by probably the worst front-door guy ever. It was quite busy, but we were told we were the &#34;next in line&#34; to get in, several times! Turns out he was saying that to most of people in the line, too keep them happy? After one hour, we were still waiting outside.<br><br>At the end we got inside, and I was expecting that the homemade pasta would make the chaotic and long wait worth it. It did not. After 40 more minutes waiting for our food, I had a rather average pasta plate. Definitely not worth more than one star.<br><br>Perhaps it was just a super busy day, but they should get a more a more strict and reliable front-door guy.	0
I was somewhat disappointed by this place, coming in with almost no expectation (Mother always said to try new things right?). I have simply decided Nepali food is just not for me. There were very few meat options and the portions were not great. I almost felt I could have cooked a better meat and rice dish for a much cheaper price in my own home.	0
I&#39;ve been thinking, dreaming, fantasizing about the sashimi for days. You can watch it being made fresh to order. <br><br>The drunks=amazing. Great looking full bar.<br><br>Ceviche, second best item on the menu after sashimi.<br><br>This will be my happy hour, post theater, anytime I need food, go to place. <br><br>The owner Edgar is so kind and welcoming. For being a new spot the servers know their menu items and are honest.<br><br>Banana ICE CREAM...enough said. <br><br>The patio area is beautiful and the lights of Hollywood enhance the look even more.	1
Small but great place. The food is amazing and it&#39;s freshly cooked. It&#39;s pretty fast. I recommend the meat spin tops. Johnny is really hilarious and will make you laugh too.	1
i didnt like the kimchi ramen...the cabbage tasted like it had been around for awhile..chewy. i usually get their bbq pork ramen. their ramen is pretty mediocre. definitely better places to go for ramen.	0
I didn't eat, but the view is amazing.Great for drinks and good conversation.Vibe: Classy & Relaxed.	1
It was surely a 4-5 start a while ago. Portions sizes and recent wait staff has made us drop our rating. When they pulled out the Saturday Brunch, it started to slide down hill. Reservation policies have done numerous changes too.	0
By far, the best sandwiches in the area. They also have good prices. Go for the &#34;Go Ham&#34; sandwich, it&#39;s delicious. I highly recommend it.	1
Had been wanting to check this place out for a while... We finally went last night and were pretty impressed. I give the vibe and service 5 stars.... The restaurant itself is very quaint with about 12-15 tables... The food was very good. Although we we&#39;re not blown away that is why my overall rating is 4 stars. Great restaurant for a romantic date . The outside terrace looked very nice for drinks. They told us the have free live music every night which we definitely plan on checking out soo	1
I am starting to believe that I will never find a good Thai restaurant in Miami :( i had lunch here with my sister and the food left a lot to be desired. The pad Thai was greasy and bland, the tom yum soup was watery and had little flavor. It only earned two stars because the cute atmosphere was a redeeming quality. Will never eat here again.	0
The beat pizza I've ever had period.	0
I think I&#39;ve been to most burger joints around. This one was good, had a variety of special burgers and the fries where so tummy. We played it safe this time around with California burger but they had one with eggs.. Hmmm. Staff is very friendly, offered info on menu and quick. Location is small but has seating tables and counters. Private parking right across from bj&#39;s on 117. Burgers where juicy, big and yummy. Will go back to try out other options.	1
When I worked nearby, this place would be lunch 4 out of 5 days. You have to get there before 12 or else the line starts to build. The jerk chicken is spiced just like they do in Jamaica and has got a pretty strong kick to it too. It takes some conditioning not to have your tongue go complete number after the first bite but once you get over it, you can really enjoy the flavor. Shes on Govorner&#39;s Island on the weekends too,	1
This place definitely serves the BEST clam chowder ever! We came back twice in 2 days!!!	0
We went on Wednesday and the special was Pernil or roasted pork It was best I had ever! The service was outstanding and I agree with other comments about you feeling like family. We just moved to WA from Texas and we will drive here from Olympia in a heart beat.	1
I used to go to this place all the time. Of the seafood spots in the neighborhood this one definitely has the best deals. The Red White and Blue special of half a dozen blue point oysters and a PBR for $8 definitely had me won over for a bit and the lobster feast for only $19. At those bargain bottom prices you kind of convince yourself you like it because you&#39;re getting a great deal. <br><br>Then, if you happen to taste a real oyster somewhere else, you start to realize: these ones are so cheap because they&#39;re completely flavorless and why the hell am I drinking PBR. <br><br>They do have better oysters than blue points for a higher price, the Spinny Creeks are good. But here&#39;s what happened the last two times I went: I ordered a dozen spinny creeks, about double the price of the bland blue points, and they bring me blue points instead. Granted, you kind of have to know what you&#39;re dealing with to be able to see the difference between a large shell blue point and the smaller shell spinny creek. <br><br>I called attention to the fact that they brought me blue points instead of the spinny creeks that I ordered and the waiter apologized and took them back. No harm, no foul, right? <br><br>THEN the next time I went there the same thing happened, I ordered spinny creek and they brought me blue points. My theory is that this place assumes that the average customer has no idea what the difference between the cheap blue points and the more expensive varieties so why not just bring them all blue points and the customer will probably only catch it every once in a while. <br><br>The Lobster Feast feels like you&#39;re getting a deal, but really what you&#39;re getting is a small lobster that always feels tough. <br><br>The mussels are pretty uninspired. <br><br>The tuna burger is not appetizing. <br><br>Actually the king crab legs are great. But at 34 bucks you&#39;d be better served to choose one of the better seafood places around. <br><br>So that&#39;s ultimately my take on this place, it has deals that seem amazing but it&#39;s because you&#39;re getting sub-par stuff. Then there are higher priced things on the menu that aren&#39;t done as well there as at other spots like Mary&#39;s Fish Camp so why bother coming here really?<br><br>I&#39;m tempted to go back a third time to see if they pull the same oyster con just so I can confirm my theory, but Mary&#39;s Fish Camp is a hundred times better so I&#39;ll probably just walk a few blocks over instead. <br><br>It seemed like a good idea at the time, Fish, but I&#39;m sorry, it&#39;s time to move on.	0
I have been coming here for the past three years since I moved to LA, and keep coming back because the burgers are amazing, and so is the pie! Tonight I came in for dessert with a friend, and the older guy that works the counter took our order. We asked for apple pie a la mode, and he said they were out, so we opted for cherry and pecan. He then brought out our pie without the ice cream, so we kindly asked for a la mode again. Then a few minutes later the people next to us ordered apple pie, and were served it. I was too upset to confront him about it, so I asked for some change since they&#39;re cash only. He begrudgingly grabbed me change for my twenty, and my friend needed change as well, but he said he had no more. The people whom he gave Apple pie to, pulled out a fifty and he grabbed them change with out saying anything. So my friend asked again, and he pulled out his own cash and gave her change saying, &#34;That&#39;s from my own money.&#34; I am a server at a restaurant, and the way he treated us was unacceptable. I am always courteous and perspective of the role of people serving me when being on the other side, and am confused and angry as to why we were treated this way. I&#39;ve been trying to gather why we were served with such contempt, but there&#39;s really no excuse. I love the food, but won&#39;t be coming back after being so blindly discriminated against.	0
The margaritas were really reasonable and pretty good.	1
I really like this place. It wasn't at all what I was expecting; I pass by everyday on my way home and I imagined some small sad diner with tacky decor. But the inside is really small with a counter around a central kitchen with no tacky decor in sight. It is a little difficult to get a seat when it's busy but as long as you have manners and let people who were waiting first be seated, you will have a pleasant experience. My boyfriend and I shared a hickory burger, fries and a banana cream pie. I thought the food was pretty tasty, but I am a sucker for burgers. It's kind of pricey if you consider the simplicity of the food, but the Classic Americana feel to it just can be beat. Parking is kind of a hassle but we parked at the Westfield mall across the street since they have three free hours of parking. Also, don't expect too much from the staff; we went while it was busy, and they are super fast but not chatty, so don't expect a whole lotta chit chat.	1
I LOVE THIS PLACE and I really don&#39;t want to share this cute little place with any of you guys.... but I&#39;ll be nice and share. <br><br>This is a hard to find location unless you yelp. Like other says, it is inside the building where Alfred&#39;s coffee is and you will go down a short flight of stairs to find the door. <br><br>I ordered the Kale salad and scrambled eggs. Food has a very unique combination. Scrambled eggs came with prosciutto and avocado as well as tomato cheese toast. At first I was eating them separately and then the idea hits me.. OHH I was suppose to stack everything on top of the toast and then it was like fireworks in my mouth. Delicious and very creative!! <br>Kale salad was very refreshing and the waitress was kind to order half portion for me seeing that I ordered eggs already. (It doesn&#39;t state on the menu you can do that I think). However, I do think the kale salad was a little bit on the oily side but it was still good. <br><br>This place is very small and they have an open kitchen concept. There is outdoor patio for dogs as well. But its so cute.. almost feel like my own house. I will definitely come back.	1
I love Apple Pans. I go by every time I&#39;m in the area. I think its so funny reading these reviews of the prissy ass people who complain about it here.<br>It is what it is and that&#39;s what makes this place awsome. It&#39;s called character! Who cares if you have to stand and wait a while and if it&#39;s too many people go somewhere else. I think the grumpy old men are cool and they aren&#39;t always grumpy.<br>Every burger is great! I&#39;ve only had the apple and banana cream pies, but they were both amazing!	1
So happy we found this gem on a recent business trip to Seattle. They make fresh food with local in-season ingredients, allowing each flavor to sing. I read good reviews on Yelp and even though I was concerned it was mainly a brunch place also making dinner, I am so glad we gave it a try. Sarah, our waitress, was attentive and her recommendations did not fail. Specialty cocktails were delicious and refreshing on a warm summer evening. My vegetarian friend and I shared a fresh and delicious heirloom salad with mozzarella mousse (every restaurant should consider making this whipped cream and cheese concoction!) and fennel vinaigrette. Our non-vegetarian friend tried the pea and mint soup, which he declared also fresh and delicious. The table was then split between vegetarian savory crepes and pork tenderloin. Our 4th friend bit into his baked beans, closed his eyes and could barely speak for a moment he was so swept away by the taste. During the dinner, 3 of the 4 of us found ourselves closing our eyes and saying OMG, this is so good! As a final delight, we shared a smoked chocolate pot de creme. I thoughtlessly pushed it away when I was finished, and my friend grabbed it back to finish scraping the final bits from the pot. Next time in Seattle, we'll be sure to come here again. Sarah warned us that we'll need reservations if we come for brunch. If more people experience the dinner, soon it will be reservations-needed as well.	1
&#34;Meh&#34; encapsulates this place. I&#39;d say this is the first time Yelpers have failed me. <br><br>Overpriced doesn&#39;t even begin to describe this food. It&#39;s not *horrible* food, no. The portions are pretty small, but that&#39;s to be expected at a &#34;nice&#34; restaurant like Cliff&#39;s Edge. However, those small portions are supposed to be layered, sophisticated, rich. The best high-end restaurants take time to craft each dish both in terms of conception and execution; these dishes lacked inspiration, craft, technique, and soul. <br><br>I understand that thirty dollars isn&#39;t necessarily a lot to spend on one dish at a restaurant in a city like Los Angeles, but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s a moderate amount of money to spend on a dish in general. Plus, you can get a delicious taco al pastor for a dollar at so many places in this city. Thirty tacos = just one dish at a &#34;nice&#34; restaurant, so you really want that extra money to count. <br><br>Your mileage may vary, depending on the dish you choose. I had the shrimp and seared scallops atop saffron risotto. The scallops and shrimp were not too flavorful, though the scallops were well-cooked. The risotto was bland, almost diluted, as if they had used too much water. Too much water would also explain why the rice was overcooked and a little mushy, a big no-no for risotto, which should be al dente. The butter pooled on the plate. The peas seemed frozen. Overall, it was simply not flavorful, and not worth twenty-six dollars. If this dish were ten dollars cheaper, I might add a star, but please! I&#39;ve made better risotto milanese at home, and I&#39;m not much of a cook. <br><br>My boyfriend had the duck with &#34;crispy&#34; gnocchi. &#34;Crispy&#34; here doesn&#39;t mean gently pan-fried, but DEEP-FRIED. He joked that this meant they were trying to mask that the gnocchi was store-bought, but then we realized he was probably right. I suppose &#34;deep-fried gnocchi&#34; could have been good, but they over-fried them, and the oil tasted old. On the walk back to the car, boyfriend said he should have asked for ketchup to go with his gnocchi, because they tasted more like french fries than delicious morsels of potato pasta. The duck was well-cooked, but a bit too plain (just rubbed) to go with plainer, dry, deep-fried gnocchi and vegetables. Overall, the dish was ill-conceived. <br><br>Also, the hostess table isn&#39;t at the entrance; you need to walk a little bit to reach it. Not a great idea, in my opinion, but whatever. I wish we could try it again to see if it was a fluke (given the great reviews here), but there are just too many restaurants in L.A. to justify shelling out another 30 dollars+ each at Cliff&#39;s Edge.	0
I&#39;ve been here a few times, and I&#39;ve never had to wait.<br>If you come in from the front door (that is, from street parking, not the back parking lot), you don&#39;t get noticed so you kind of have to holla&#39; at them ... or just wait patiently until you get noticed.<br><br>They only have two side dishes (and they&#39;re both a type of kimchi - radish and cabbage). Their stone pot purple rice is always made to perfection. <br><br>I came here today because my mom&#39;s sick. Samgaetang ($13) is super good for flus and instantly makes you feel 100x better: the chicken is tender and comes off the bones easily, it&#39;s super healthy with Chinese dates and garlic and ginseng, and the chapssahl is always a plus!	1
The food was authentic Chinese full of delicious flavors. The atmosphere is awesome all orange and white, very cool vibe. The service not so authentic. They had no idea what teas they had and when delivered it was poured immediately without steeping. The first cup plain hot water. Three people $9 per pot. The appetizers arrived after the soup and entree. I thought they had forgotten but was told that the kitchen is just making things in the order they can.	1
I had 3 cheese with soup. Soup was awesome. Cider available. Lots of variation options, sweet and savory. Counter seating next to open street window was pleasant.<br>Basically I really like grilled cheese and wanted one and oh look this is close. I plan to return.	1
At the hours of dinner time, this place was the least waiting time compared to other kbbq areas. Service was gooddd, servers came whenever we needed anything. However, meat quality of briskets were quite disappointing. Briskets were mostly fatty without meat. For price of $17.99 ayce it felt like I was paying for $10.99 ayce at other restaurants.. However daechang large intestine was really gooodd, looked real fresh and firm. Overall 4 stars, it was a bit lacking that would make me crave for this restaurant.	1
My sister-in-law, daughter, my daughter's three friends and I had dinner at the All American Bar and Grill. Overall, the experience was very good. Our waiter, Jimmy, was overextended with tables-but he ended up taking good care of us. We had pretzels and spinach dip to start--both were great :) Everyone's dinner was also very good--the flat iron steaks were cooked PERFECTLY!! I felt like the mashed potatoes and the vegetables were probably cooked earlier in the afternoon because they did not seem fresh, and they were overcooked--veggies were too soft--mashed were sticky rather than creamy and smooth. We did eat what we were served, but I think the items served with a fabulous steak, should be as good as the steak itself.	1
Every single time I&#39;m back in LA, without fail, my first stop is the Apple Pan. Mind you, this is even before going home to see my family! I love it, I don&#39;t even need to tell my brother anymore, first stop from the airport, he knows it&#39;s the pan!!!<br><br>nuff said!!!! snobs/foodies can argue over this place day in and day out, but this place hasn&#39;t changed in 60+ years, they must be doing something right......	1
Cheap and delicious, just the way I like my food. And Tunisian? When&#39;s the last time you had Tunisian food? Granted, most of the menu seemed to be pretty generic middle eastern without too many Tunisia-specific specialties. But it was tasty nonetheless. The platters are massive and can feed 2 people.	1
Ate here last night and the food was amazing and service was great. Highly recommend and will definitely eat here again.	1
Used to love this place and bring all our out of town guests. Went here his morning for brunch and noticed quite a difference in the quality? Is this place under new management? Out pretzel knots were stale, food was bland,and sandwich bread was hard. We even found plastic in our salad! That being said, they did take the salad off the menu and apologize. (We appreciated this). Drinks and location still makes this place a possible stop in. Hope our next visit is better..... If there is one.	0
My husband and I are pie fanatics..and thankfully our friends referred us to this amazing place. We stopped by this morning and the pie selection was to die for.... I got the sour cherry, which was slightly tart and with a perfectly crisp crust. My hubbs got coconut cream pie, which was according to him... &#34;the best I&#39;ve ever had&#34;. The large slices are served on adorable plates with tiny forks. <br><br>I am excited to venture back for strawberry season, and peaches this summer! <br><br>There are about 6 comfortable stools for those who want to eat in the store.. and pies can be purchased to go. <br><br>And for those who like unique pie-related gifts, there are ceramic pie plates and gorgeous wooden pie servers.	1
I wont bore you with ALL the details, but I will tell you this: DO NOT GO HERE I can't even put into words how horribly my party was treated. Not by the waiter, who was wonderful or by the bartender who was perfect, but by the Assistant Manager, Sara. She was spiteful, rude and even drove away two of people in party who arrived late by saying "The restaurant is full, all of these empty tables are reserved all night" just because they had a small baby with them. The tables were sat by walk-ins (we asked) and she wouldn't allow my friends to even put their names in for a table, they had to leave a half empty restaurant! She forced the server to add a 25% service charge to our party of 6 (he was visibly embarrassed by this), and sat other people in our party at the opposite end of the restaurant. It was only 6pm and the restaurant was empty. When the bus boy moved the party closer to us, she yelled at him and glared at us. This was all AFTER she told us we were not able to add any people to our reservation when we called the day before to do so AND after she demanded that our party only order off of a $55 "special" menu. We are all professionals, all foodies, we all spend a lot of money on great food on a regular basis and I have never in my life been treated like a second class citizen until this event. Please, Please, don't go here. Besides that, the bone marrow is better at Animal, the escargot is better at Cafe Beaujolais, and the steak is better just about anywhere.	0
Yes, I am a HUGE fan of this place from the first time I visited. <br><br>I can still taste the steak sandwich with stick potato chips in it. YUMMY!. Keep in mind that most of the food sold at El Palacio De Los Jugos is cooked with lots of love which basically means, not the healthiest stuff you can eat. Think lots of grease, frying, and all the other stuff that makes food taste so damn good but it&#39;s so bad for our bodies. <br><br>Here you can find different stands that sell different types of foods. There is a sandwich stand, a seafood stand, a juice stand, a hot meal stand, and a stand with all fried goods, EXTRA YUMMY!!<br><br>I know makes this place a staple for those who come and visit. They have all loved it. So much so, that they usually make a pit stop on their way to Miami airport. Be it a juice, sandwich, or full meal, you know those other passengers on the plane will be very envious. So stop here before jumping on your flight. It sure beats what they sell on the plane nowadays.	1
fancied up chipotle<br>they have options like shredded chicken, carnitas, pickled cabbage<br>and a variety of salsas to choose from<br>wish the portion sizes were bigger (like chipotle!)<br>but that&#39;s probably because i&#39;m an oinker	1
The service was excellent, very accommodating as we changed our group size and they were very flexible. Several menu items were not available this particular time we visited. The orioles game was on so that we could watch from our seats which was very nice!	0
Interesting, 567 reviews and 47 say this place is terrible.... 1 star they give it! What are these people dense? What where they expecting? This is a diner. Maybe the best diner in Los Angeles. You don't survive in Los Angeles being open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year for EIGHTY-SIX YEARS if you are really terrible.I have been coming here as long as I can remember and that is 50+ years. My USC graduated parents have been coming here since they were children in Los Angeles in the 1930's and even more when they were in college at USC. We also came here for breakfast before USC games as I grew up and most of the crowd was in Cardinal & Gold.For breakfast the pancakes are really cakes, the tastes is amazing, but I am usually crisp bacon, two eggs over easy with potatoes, sourdough toast toasted on the grill.At night it is the poor man's Palm. There isn't a better bargain for a steak in Los Angeles.And at 2:30 in the morning when you just aren't ready to drive home, the Pantry is a life saver, steaming hot black coffee and greasy food, maybe a burger to help you home.	1
We totally enjoyed New Years Eve Dinner at Baja Miguel's @ the South Point Casino!!  Service was wonderful, friendly, efficient and patient for new diners!!!  Food was spectacular.  Everyone at our table totally enjoyed the entre that they had chosen.  Margaritas were good too, and the wine menu was appropriate for the menu.We were so fortunate to have found Baja Miguel's and we all look forward to going there again soon!!!We are impressed with the selection available!!Price point was very reasonable too!!!  Nice placed to take out your friends and family!!!Atmosphere was friendly with many large circular booths!!	1
Aroooooooga!LOVE this place. Friends and I have been here a couple of times - once for a girls night, and then recently a bunch of us went for Halloween. It's a super clever spot, tucked between two tall brick buildings. You'd never know it was there! Drinks are cheap, and there is plenty of indoor and outdoor seating (with propane heat lamps). There's a giant projector screen, where they'll play either music videos, Korean soap operas, or a random movie. Service is quick, and easy. On Halloween, they even gave everyone a free shot! How awesome is that? Love you, Far Bar!	1
Excellent restaurant! Food is great, very professional service. You got to try pork chops. I recommend this place for any occasion.	1
The bill here was gigantic as was the winelist - maybe as big as a phonebook but the food was just OK. The famous Canlis Salad was at best average tasting. It was a bit too dark for our liking. The service was exceptional. Out of the way to get to but the views are outstanding.	0
Went here for our anniversary and though the pictures looked romantic, it was just ok. Didn&#39;t get anything special for our anniversary either. The only saving grace was the Brussels sprouts! So delicious! We&#39;ve been trying to recreate it at home ever since. I&#39;d go back just for them, they were that good! But it might be odd to go just to order two or three orders of Brussels sprouts.	1
Love the coffee and atmosphere her. It's a unique group of people that I love, but sometimes the wait for your food can be quite a while. They have communal tables and laptop free time, which are great. Lovely addition to the community.	1
Wonderful food and great people!	1
Amazing spot. One of my top 3 in silverlake. I could each the hopped salad every day for the rest of my life. And the chicken liver crostone, pigs in a blanket, fusilli, tortellini, octopus and everything else you can order out of control. And the almond cake dessert...man I love this place.	1
Fun bar, especially the patio, with a good beer selection and tasty snacks.	1
My new fave: tripa tacos!!	1
Three words: Shark Fin Soup. &nbsp;Unconscionable.	0
Going from finish to start. Considering the pricing which is close if not the same as Morton's Steakhouse I would have expected better quality food, flavor and technique. I have received similar presentation and food taste (which I not saying is bad) at Joe's crabshack but Bruzio's prices are obviously higher. You can tell sometimes, they are cooking with higher quality seafood but then the taste seems like they are using the old bleaching of seafood that has become older and fishy. I have been eating seafood since a child and I can now taste the difference from fish that has been kept past its prime, bleached and then presented as fresh like the day it arrived. I will give a slight bit a slack considering the seafood arrived in that shape but trying to push it past costumers then falls right back onto the restaurant. Now the quality of the lesser food items like potatoes, corn, and other vegetables does not merit the pricing listed. I could have it wrong but it's called price shifting; to cover the price of a higher item the price of lesser items are raised slightly but at this restaurant the quality does not match the independent elevated price of that item. Anyway, first sight impression was a small place that doesn't really speak to one as an upscale seafood restaurant. However, the service was good and the food was good but not great. I received a $50 return credit and I'd come back for their crab cakes; they rose to the occasion and maybe the price if they gave 3 instead of just 2.	1
Stop numero 3 for me one night when I went bar hopping in DTLA. Boy oh boy was I in for a treat. First of all, the bar is located at the top of Pershing Square Building. ROOFTOP bar. Next to Pershing Square, hence the name, this bar has an amazing view of downtown and Pershing Square. Who would have thought DTLA could look so great with all of the lights.<br><br>Such a fan of this place, the atmosphere and ambiance were great. There is a lot of open seating, both inside and outside. There are fireplaces and heaters placed throughout the area. My group scored the little area in the corner of the outside patio with a fireplace and rocking bench. Such a good time!<br><br>Once you hit the lobby, you take an elevator to another level where you take another elevator to the bar on the roof. When we went, thankfully, there was no line and were whisked right away to the top. I hear that it can get crowded during heavy nights, so come a little early if you want to avoid lines. <br><br>Drinks were normal pricing. All I can remember was the round of Tequila shots I bought for people.. it was all history from there..<br><br>Oh Perch.. I&#39;ll be sure to be back to perch near your warm fireplace and enjoy the drinks, view and great company.	1
Great food! Good ambience. A little on the pricier side but the portions are great! My faves: kale+spinach salad, parades let with bolognesi; 8 hour smoked shortribs. The smoked tequila cocktail is fantastic! Will bring friends here next time for sure!	1
No sign. Just a pink door.  (I don't know why I was looking for a dark pink door......but it's actually a light pink door.) Might not even notice it as you walk down Post Alley.	0
Loved this place until one night my girlfriends purse was stolen out of the blue . No one approached our table except the workers their. Coincidently they happen to have found it but without her cc and iphone. this place is shady right now. Watch your purse and iphone carefuly.	0
For an AYCE place, it&#39;s pretty solid.<br><br>We got the $17.99 Deluxe AYCE and the selection was definitely more than most places that offer the same.<br><br>My favorites of the night were:<br><br>Seasoned prime short rib<br>Brisket<br>Kimchi Fried Rice<br>Pork jaw<br><br>Not so great to average meats were:<br><br>Beef tongue<br>Spicy pork belly<br>Intestine<br><br>The banchans were pretty standard but at least there&#39;s a decent selection. The service was above average (better than most KBBQ places) although their grills get very smoky and burns quickly so prepare to wash your clothes after the meal.<br><br>Overall, I like the quality of meat slightly better from Road to Seoul but this place definitely had more selection of meat and side dishes. I&#39;d give it B+ to A-	1
Taste: 4<br>Creativity/Authenticity: 3.5<br>Atmosphere: 4.5 <br>Service: 4.5<br>Bang for your buck: 3<br><br>This is my first time here took my friend for her bday lunch. What i love about this place is it brings out Los angeles un like anything you can find in the valley or anywhere else; warm breeze sitting outside during the summer. I love the ambiance of this place little italy feeling with a bakery connected brings back memories of NYC. Now to the food, got the special of the day salad, a snap pee with feta cheese, arugula, red onions, fried prosciutto and poached egg perfect salad to start doesn&#39;t fill you up. Had to get the rice balls; not bad nothing special but cooked perfectly with great seasoning. I got the pepper and cheese house linguini and my friend got the fried oyster sandwich. The pasta was ok was expecting more very small portion, great flavor but i should have gotten the wild boar bacon one, who have given it better texture. The oyster sandwich was ok, wasn&#39;t too keen on the bread chosen; the flat bread was a little too crispy but overall it was a solid sandwich. Now to dessert got the cheesecake and the rocky road OMG!! the rocky road ice cream was amazing, the cheese cake was too but i the texture was a little off still good though. Overall i like this place, will i be back yes there is still a lot of things on the menu breakfast lunch and dinner that i have to try.	1
Absolutely amazing, best restaurant I have ever been to. View is amazing, service was great. I have it four stars because it was crowded and i had to make a reservation a while in advance. Oh and also the food was delicious !	1
Great place for lunch. Super nice people, great sandwiches and salads, good coffee and a little kiddo play area makes it a great addition to the neighborhood. I will be back!	1
This new bar is without a doubt going to be a hit! Drinks are so affordable yet still very good top shelf drinks! Food is amazing! From hot wings, Mac and cheese, risotto mozzarella balls, the 9 burger. Give this place a try and you will keep coming back. Service is excellent. Parking is heavenly for Hollywood. Nothing bad about this place, only great things!	1
For all of you that say that this is the best burger, you really haven&#39;t had good burgers in your life. <br>It&#39;s by far one of the worst burgers I had, the menu is so limited and it&#39;s all about the hype, so go stand in line and have this oily gross burger if you really don&#39;t have any standards.	0
I&#39;ve been to Umiya a few times. The first time was outstanding. The fish was fresh and flavorful, the service attentive, and there&#39;s a decent menu selection for AYCE. Excited to have found a great new sushi place, I went back to try the lunch specials, which were also great. However, over the last few months the quality and service have taken a nosedive. <br><br>A friend and I were in on a Sat night for AYCE dinner. We were seated promptly even though it was somewhat busy, but we hadn&#39;t even got our coats off before someone came to take our order. Clearly not ready yet. Then, when we were ready, despite the army of staff, no one came. I&#39;ll spare the extensive list of service fails throughout the evening, but it&#39;s really the service that is earning the 2 star rating here. Basically, we didn&#39;t get what we ordered the first time, were unable to get someone to take a follow up order, had food thrown down on the table by servers on their way to somewhere else, and were overcharged. To top it off, the fish was bland and the portion sizes had shrunk from previous visits. I&#39;d rate the food about 2.5 stars. Time to scratch this one off the list. There&#39;s just so many better places in town.	0
Probably one of the best sandwiches Ive had in a long time and well worth the $14. The pork is perfectly cooked, the sauce is amazing and the ciabatta roll is a great touch to pull the sandwich together. The cole slaw is a bit bland but the caramel bacon is definitely something worth trying. I will certainly be back!	1
The Farmhouse theme is appropriate because you have a goat as your upstairs bartender.<br><br>When I arrived alone at the upstairs bar I sat down at the end. The Rob Zombie clone bartender took 10 minutes before he even acknowledged my existence. It took another 7 minutes for him to ask me if I wanted anything. If his goal was to make me feel unwelcome than I would give him 5 stars. <br><br>I ordered a housemade ginger ale and he made sure to comment to his coworkers about me ordering that. There were 5 or 6 staff members standing around talking to each other. In the meanwhile, I had no water or silverware.<br><br>The food was good but really nothing that amazing. I feel like they were trying to steal the Amish Chicken at the Bristol but it fell way short. Who know&#39;s maybe I just got the upstairs B-Team but on a Friday night but that just doesn&#39;t seem possible.<br><br>My suggestion is to get rid of the bartender upstairs who has a lot of hair and grooms himself with his hands every 5 minutes. You are serving food and pouring drinks so stop touching yourself.	0
Seriously, no toro? Home for ten days on leave and there's no fatty tuna, here or anywhere else I visited? Someone hates me...	0
the last time i went to this place was i have to fight for a taco they re expensive the tortillas were cold as fucking hell the cashier thinks shes the last person on earth but at the end no my kind of place to eat or pay for those tacos they re not good as i expected	0
Their pizza's are very yummy. I specifically like the pizza because they have thin crust..	1
I really like Manna. I work pretty close, and all my coworkers have always raved about it. It took me awhile to finally get my butt over there and try it, and when I finally did, I seriously wondered what took me so long. The first thing I had was a Rueben, and it was pretty much perfect. The meat was tender and juicy, the bread perfectly toasted. It was dripping with a delicious Russian dressing and it pretty much melted in my mouth. Since then, I've gone back multiple times, and it quickly became one of me and my boyfriend's favorite restaurants. While the Rueben isn't exactly an image of health, they have many healthy, fresh menu items that all taste equally as delectable. I've tried the vegetarian peter wrappit (light, fresh, flavorful), and the not-so-vegetarian southwest quinoa chicken wrap (also fresh, but spicy, savory, and really filling), and both were delicious. The staff has always been incredibly warm, friendly, and cheery, even amidst the chaos that is their regular weekend brunch madness (proceed with caution on the weekends, it is VERY popular, but absolutely worth the wait).	1
You get what you pay for. <br><br>This place is fairly cheap, $20 for breakfast for 2 but the quality is just not that good. I&#39;m pretty sure we were given 1 egg omelettes.<br><br>There&#39;s better places around with and without the excessive wait. Try them instead.	0
Overall very disappointed with the service received on multiple occasions. My wife (Jamaican of descent) and I live next door and were very excited to have this place so close, especially being avid Food Network watchers. But the lady who runs the place is extremely rude and seems more preoccupied with showboating her Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives poster that actually dishing out quality food and service. Now the first time we went there we received poor service. We gave them the benefit of the doubt and decided to try again. Unfortunately during the next 3 visits also received poor service (old, cold food, moldy bread, rude service in particular by the &#34;seemingly&#34; pleasant lady who runs the place) and I can affirmatively say that I will not be going back anymore. What a let down.	0
I used to love this place, but they replaced the earth burger with a different, awful option. Not worth attending if you're a vegetarian.	0
We made our reservation for 5:15pm, took about 10 minutes to seat a table for 5 , it was prepared with white dishes and very clean looking restaurant . We ordered drinks, the Fuji (not so good ) then a Mai tai (terrible) they need a seasoned bartender.the cocktails sound appetizing until you drink them they must be using unsweetened juices.we ordered some dishes family style beef chow fun, shrimp fried rice,,stated one price in the menu then another price when the check came  they should print for party size the extra money to be added ,large plates we ordered broiled coconut chicken/rice..it was tasty , appetizers lettuce wraps,Korean tacos pretty good ..the family style dinner selections were just warm not hot as well as the chicken, our server Christi was very sweet and accomdating, overall it was an ok experience but a better experience because it was family time	1
Came here for lunch with a friend, and we both really enjoyed our meals.	0
Love it! Super friendly and knowledge staff, fresh seafood and reasonable wine list. I fear it will become very popular very quickly...so I will have to wait in line :(<br>Must haves include: lobster roll (MUST have!), devil eggs, crude of the day and Kumamoto oysters,,.i am salivating as I am writing..time to go back!	1
Ordered delivery at 8:15, expecting a 45 minute delivery (as they told me). It&#39;s now almost 10 pm and I still haven&#39;t gotten my food. I understand that the weather&#39;s rainy but damn, warn a girl about the huge wait. When I called to check up the guy who answered the phone was rude as well. All I got was a half hearted &#34;sorry for the inconvenience, but we&#39;re busy.&#34; <br><br>Now that I&#39;ve received my food finally, it&#39;s not even the right order. Tasty, but not what I wanted in the first place and waited over an hour for. :( The nachos were still good but really soggy and my taco was cold.	0
What&#39;s better than hanging with great beer and whiskey? Doing it here! great vibes and exteremely friendly staff. So far I&#39;ve only had the whiskey and wasabi fries, but I&#39;m in love.	1
I really can&#39;t say enough great things about this establishment. I have been enjoying the food here for a good 25 years and I&#39;ve NEVER had a problem. The service is fast and the food is always on par. I love the steak burger! Though the egg salad and the tuna salad are just as good. And lets not forget the PIE! Yep, game over!	1
chips and salsa!!!... i'm a simple guy. i don't ask for much, but when i'm having mexican food, i must have unlimited supply of chips and salsa. that's not too much to ask, is it? well, it is if you happen to be at colibri. you see, after $140 later, the girlfriend and i are wholly unsatisfied with our experience at colibri because they do not serve chips and salsa. instead, they serve you tortilla and salsa.colibri, how authentic of you to serve tortilla and salsa, but can i also have the chips and salsa option? i mean, after all, my girlfriend and i spent $140 on food and drinks that we feel are inferior and bland to the other fancy mexican restaurant in town - maya. yes, your interior is nicely decorated. it's all warm and rich and classy, but damn it, i want my chips and salsa! so what do you say? will you in the future?oh, colibri, by the way, did you know when i left to use the restroom, your guacamole "chef" was trying to hit on my girlfriend. "hey, how you like my guacamole? you likey?" wink. wink. what?!?!?! of course, she told me about the encounter after we got home. classy, colibri. really classy. so in conclusion, as you can tell, we were completely underwhelmed and annoyed by the colibri experience. we'll take papalote or velvet cantina any day over colibri.........and they serve beautiful chips and salsa!	0
When you call to order, don't get surprised. Someone on the phone can't speak English well and don't explain anything and don't ask anything. She sounds like very angry person. A little annoying to me.And especially, I told them no cilantro many times but it came with cilantro.	0
Amazing ambiance, more NYC then LA, and delicious food make this place a hidden gem especially being in Little Tokyo surrounded by Japanese restaurants and bars. Walk in and sit at the tables between the brick walls, order a beer, a burger, and just watch day turn into night, the over hanging lights turn on, and feel transported to a whole new city. Discovered this place with a friend tonight with the help of Thrillist Rewards - had 2 flights of craft brews, endless wasabi fries (i think they were just ok) and fried chicken wings (best wings ever, like Bonchon and Kyochon, but just much better), and a choice of one of their half pound angus burgers. Burger reminds me of Father's Office (not as good but more gourmet then the typical franchise type like Islands). But its the wings. Amazing! And the waitstaff is very friendly. Definitely coming back here soon.	1
Their food is really good, service is great and prices are very reasonable. This is a must go everybody :)	1
Cool spot, tucked away on a small quiet street. A little hard to find since their storefront is blocked with insulating curtains but once you step in, it&#39;s a pretty chill cafe/restaurant that serves organic foods and smoothies for the health-conscious. I ordered a custom smoothie and sandwich and enjoyed the freshness of it all. I didn&#39;t even have to ask for no mayo to be included as they automatically prepare the foods with minimal dressings. There were a few other groups having more intimate dinners with bottles of wine and such but I came because I wanted a quick healthy bite.	1
If one is what one eats I'll come out as a piece of garbage!  You can't pay be to feed this stuff to my pets. And they charge too much for drinks!  Plus they don't sell single slices.	0
I was craving some late night chicken pad see ew, so I was thrilled to see that this place was open and also delivered. I called to place my order and was immediately told they were cash only and there was a minimum of $15 for delivery. No big deal, so I placed my order for pick up. When I arrived, I was happy to see that my order was ready, but the lady who checked me out could barely look at me and was distracted with something else. I requested a soda to go as well, which I was hoping would be refrigerated, but it was not. I paid and was not provided nor offered a receipt, there were also no napkins nor utensils provided. I was still excited to dig into my pad see ew but was unfortunately let down. It was cold and the chicken and noodles were all burned, which completely masked any good flavor. It definitely didn't hit the spot along with the warm soda. Perhaps it was just the dish that I ordered so am open to trying a different dish another time. However, the next time I'm craving pad see ew, I'll just go to Thai Time nearby or wait for Osha or Lers Ros to open.	0
La Boulanga is my new favorite place! I like the salads, the sweets and jams! I will keep trying and writing about this place...	1
We brought 100+ people from out of town to The Fountain for a Lacrosse team party.  Harold and his team did a great job taking care of us. Way to go 'D', Miles and all the bartenders! Great service and really good food! We'll be back!	0
Best best carne asada quesadilla! Aside from that, there&#39;s a lot of random goodies. The most tender chicken piccata I&#39;ve had. Few spots have that great customer service that only family owned businesses can give you. Vegetarian friendly. Recommend you have an agua fresca, I&#39;ve had horchata and the watermelon drinks. Good stuff.	1
The dinner pre-fixe is an amazing deal. All of the starters were standouts - green tomato pies, pretzel rolls, and bluefish pate were fantastic. We ordered the lamb and striped bass as mains - lamb was great, bass was a bit bland. Definitely redeemed with dessert though, as well as with the chocolates the chef brings out at the end of the meal. All in all a really great experience with exceptional service.	1
Not really sure why all the great reviews. I got the Fried strips. They were just ok. Without any sauce they are really flavorless. Much prefer Raising Canes. Had the famous Mac N Cheese...again just ok, no flavor. The BFG sauce was pretty decent. Would possibly go back if in the neighborhood and need some grub, but wouldn&#39;t go out of my way for it.	0
Normally I go the upper east side location on 1st avenue where their service and food is great! However, since I now work in midtown this location is more convenient. <br><br>I called and order the lunch special (green plantains, quarter chicken and a side order or rice and beans) for delivery at 1:39 PM. (I only order green plantains because I was told they don&#39;t have anymore yellow). Then I asked how long would it take to be delivered? And was told 30 - 40 minutes, which is normal. After I noticed an hour went by I called and was told the delivery man was on his way. He finally called me at 3:06 PM to come down for my food. I tip him and was on my way. <br><br>Normally when you order food the container is usually warm/hot but this time is wasn&#39;t. I then opened the container and realized the food was cold. My plantains were hard and disgusting! So I called Pio Pio to inform them that they delivered cold food. I was transferred to a horrible woman who was very rude! First, I confronted her about delivering the food about 1 hour late. Her response was &#34;well that is an estimate, so&#34;... Secondly, I said &#34;well the food is cold&#34;. She then said again &#34;well it&#39;s an estimate so we don&#39;t know the exact time&#34;. Then I asked, &#34;so you think it&#39;s OK to deliver cold food?&#34; and she said NOTHING! No apology, no sorry for your inconvenience. So I informed her that she &#34;just lost a customer&#34; and i will never order from them again and hung up! I was livid!!! Definitely a waste of $14.70 and $2 tip. In the future when I want good food, i will order from Havana Central. There food is much better and they have better customer service.	0
This place is legit. They not only have baked goods on lock down but they know what they're doing with sandwiches, cheese, iced tea and coffee. For being as fabulous as they are the prices are quite reasonable.	1
We waited in a non-busy restaurant over 15 minutes before we left without being served. What a disappointing experience for a Douglas restaurant. 2-15-2011	0
I was excited to try to this place given all the positive reviews so far and the fact its a block from my apartment. While the service and decor were on point, the food was severely lacking.<br><br>For appetizers we ordered the Lamb, crispy crab, and the tuna crudo. The lamb was dry and the au jus was flavorless. The crispy crab tasted more like a fish stick and was way too greasy because of the thick breading. The tuna crudo was actually great, but unfortunately this was the only good plate we had. They also served homemade bread which was great. If I could have done our order over again it would have consisted of just the tuna crudo and the Parmesan puffs.<br><br>For entrees we both had the rib-eye and it was probably the worst steak either me or my girlfriend had ever had at a restaurant. First, the menu said the cuts were 7 oz but they were not even close to the same size. Second, I didn&#39;t taste my girlfriends steak but mine did not seem like a rib-eye cut as it was so tough and had the consistency of a NY strip. I wasn&#39;t expecting this to measure up to a steakhouse cut, but I have made a much better rib-eye at home on a stove top. <br><br>Finally, for desert we ordered the cranberry cheesecake and were once again disappointed. I thought it was average but my girlfriend remarked how the desert lacked freshness and tasted &#34;like plastic&#34;.<br><br>The bill ended up being close to $200 and I did not feel like we received a meal with quality anywhere near the price. Given the number of fantastic restaurants in the city I cannot see myself coming back here again.	0
This place is fantastic. You can't go wrong with anything you order, from delicate sweet pastries to substantial grainy breads, to a rich assortment of cheeses, to delicious sandwiches. They make this apple pastry thing that's sooo good. Nancy Silverton is the mastermind of this bakery, and her books are a must to anyone who aspires to understand the intricacies of baking bread. The folks who work here are really patient, helpful, and make useful suggestions.	1
The service is horrible. Drinks are never re-filled. Waiters are hanging out nowhere near their tables. It's overstaffed too. There are always waiters hanging out with no tables.	0
I was excited to come here based on the high reviews however I was a bit disappointed. I ordered the beets as an appetizer and did not enjoy it. The beets were drenched in a bowl of cream and did not have a refreshing taste. I had the lacquered duck for my entree and though it was a bit on the fatty side and was not tender and moist like how I like my duck prepared. Narcissa lacks presentation both dishes didn&#39;t live up to the hype.<br><br>The restaurant is cute and has a farm like setting. Waiters were friendly and nice.	0
I love this place. . always consistent with quality food, prices, and service!	1
the $$$ heavily promoted dry-aged Rib Eye was not cooked to order and the waiterdidn't really care.  Had to send it back and then it came backover-cooked.  No effort to adjust the bill.	0
This is one of my favorite spots in LA. It is to me another Los Angeles landmark. With a huge selection of sandwiches, salads and deli specialties, you can find something for everyone at Canter's They make some decent breakfast dishes, but I always get a sandwich, it is hard to resist. If you are in a hurry, call ahead and pick up something from the deli counter. Wanna just grab something sweet, check out the bakery counter and take something home. If you are coming here for some late night dining, you may even want to pop into the Kibbitz Room next door for a drink and some live local music. Overall, this is my go to place when I want a good sandwich or simply when I cannot figure out what I want to eat!	1
So bad!! I had the yuckiest sweet potato quesadilla. Couldn't eat more than two bites. I won't give it another try.	0
Pretty good pies with a unique selection of toppings and prepared in a fire oven. Pricey for the personal size pie @ $15-$17 each. Add another 10 bucks for parking in the lot next door and a couple beers......	0
Stuff em is the place to go for a great burger. Everyone who disagrees, has no taste buds.<br><br>Went to downtown to find some suits and all of a sudden I get hungry.<br>So many food restaurants to choose from but yelp directed us to Stuff Em. We read many great reviews on this place so we had to try.<br><br>The place was definitely great! The meat was juicy and the fries were definitely tasty.<br>Thanks to mikes great service, I had a good experience and will definitely be a spot I will return to for a long time.<br><br>So now I write a good review so that way many other people can find out how great this place is.	1
Went back and they gave turkey cold cuts instead of real turkey lil disappointing the chef did take it off the bill so I do go back bc that&#39;s a good business man just ask before ordering	1
Best pancakes I've ever had - every other pancake disappoints me because my standard is the Original Pantry pancake - I live in CO now and I crave them (a lot).	1
This is a great place! I see the chef every Sunday at the Jackson Heights greenmarket, so I know it&#39;s fresh food! And it is very flavorful. The service it great. I&#39;m told that soon they will be accepting cards and have a liquor license. The only reason I didn&#39;t give it a full five stars is because there is only one vegetarian entree. BUT if you go for the 3 course meal, he will make it vegetarian for you!	1
Sorry I had such a high expectation for this place cuz the reviews were really good.<br>But unfortunately this place cannot beat the ceviche that I had at food truck...<br>Ceviche was too sour. Too salty...<br>I&#39;ll go to the truck at Venice for ceviche...	0
with out a doubt the is the BEST hamburger in LA. anyone who thinks otherwise is wrong. The hickory burger is great. Get the fries well done. It is not ment to be a high class place, it is a hamburger diner.	1
Walking around Japantown and after walking through a bazillion cool little shops, we were getting hungry. There were a plenty food options, but we wanted something close and this place was right in front of us.It's a small little place with a couple of tables inside and 3 tables outside. They have plenty of different ramen flavors and appetizers.I ordered the Miso Ramen (came with literally 1 slice of chashu) and it was alright. The hours to follow my meal - I needed water!! I was super thirsty... We also ordered Gyoza as an appetizer. Uhhh... no. Seriously? It was all OILY! First of all, server came by with the plate of gyoza and that was it. She didn't bring any plates or anything else with her. "Sure, we'll eat off our little napkins here while the three of us eat this gyoza." I placed the gyoza on my napkin and tried to soak up the oil that was glistening on the outside. My napkin was half soaked with oil by the time I was done and the gyoza wasn't even good. I also couldn't use my napkin anymore.End of story.	0
This place is very unique and delicious! I tried the spicy ramen burger and i loved it. I also tired the miso cheese fries and miso garlic fries, those were also really good. All of the food was really fresh. The prices are good and the service was friendly. I can't wait to come back and try more things on the menu.	1
This review is not about the margaritas, the eclectic food offerings, or the quality of the food served. The reason this review is not about any of those things is because they flat out refused to serve us...at least, that is the only conclusion we could come to after being seated and completely ignored until we&#39;d had enough of that nonsense and left. <br><br>My fiancee and I stopped in after drinks and fondue at the Bourgeois Pig (a personal favorite of mine) last night around 10:30pm. Since it closes at 1:00am on Saturday nights, it&#39;s not like we stopped in right before they closed. We saw the 4 1/2 star average on Yelp, and the fact that it seemed like it had just opened up, and decided to try it.<br><br>It was busy, but not inordinately so, and after we were seated we watched server after server after server zoom past us with zero acknowledgement that we were there. We remained for about 10 minutes looking at the menus and waiting for someone to say something to us (seriously, the busser who poured us some water paid more attention to us than they did). After the 10 minutes, we just got up and left. At that point the hostess was like &#34;OH, are you LEAVING?!&#34; My fiancee informed her of what happened, and we left.<br><br>For how expensive this place is (believe me, we had plenty of time to look at the menu), I wouldn&#39;t bother on this new fad that clearly believes it&#39;s god&#39;s gift to the East Village. I don&#39;t mind expensive so long as the service and food/drinks are good (again, see Bourgeois Pig earlier that night), but I won&#39;t pay those prices to be ignored all damn night.<br><br>My fellow Yelpers, don&#39;t be fooled by the 4 1/2 star average (I noticed not a single Elite has reviewed this place, and there are more than a few suspect &#34;5 star&#34; reviews).	0
This place is a hidden gem in an uninviting strip mall of popeyes and nail salons. We were looking for a place to eat before getting groceries at Mariano&#39;s and saw this had 5 stars on yelp so decided to try it out.<br><br>First off the owner was extremely nice and welcoming. He explained the menu thoroughly, everything is made fresh and you can tell after eating it.<br><br>We had a chicken shawarma plate, falafel, garlic pizza, strawberry lemonade, and baklava. The shawarma and falafel were some of the best I&#39;ve had in the city and I&#39;ve tried at least a dozen difference places. The cucumber salad and sauces that came with were tasty, but the meat is flavorful enough on its own. The pizza was solid as well, they make it in a legit wood fired oven. <br><br>You can tell that they aren&#39;t lying when they say everything is made fresh. I will definitely be back and recommend to friends. They also deliver through grubhub!	1
Went here while waiting for a St. Vitus show to start. Everything is rather expensive. Ordered the $8 clam chowder and an $8 apple pie. For an $8 clam chowder this better impress me...which it did not. It was watery, but perhaps a good sign since a lot of recipes call for flour. The taste was light and fine, the portion very small--it was like 1.25-1.5 cups of chowder. The apple pie was good and worth the $8 because you get a full mini sweet/tart pie topped with their special bourbon infused whipped cream. Everything was going okay after the sticker shock until my mouth met a piece of white plastic. At first I thought it was a piece of a lobster&#39;s inner skeleton, but it was too thick and opaque, definitely a piece of plastic. I have to say this is really disgusting. In school we were told to avoid working with burning plastics due to it being carcinogenic. <br><br>Trying to hold back my stomach from having eaten food tainted with heated plastic, I informed staff of this foreign object. The person asked if I wanted another pie. After declining that offer, he refunded my money. I felt guilty that they lost $8 + tax even though this was their fault, so just to be nice, I gave them a second tip. I know, I know, they really don&#39;t deserve it and I should never be pressured to tip more than once!<br><br>What is up with all these places leaving pieces of plastic in the food? That&#39;s just gross. <br><br>I could possibly go back for their fries if it&#39;s the only place around, but nah.	0
It&#39;s all about the ambiance. The lighting. The decor. The intricate safari themed wall paper. Although it&#39;s a small restroom tucked down a hallway, you feel like you&#39;ve been transported somewhere far away - maybe Morocco? <br><br>A large gold framed mirror takes center stage, while the small chandelier floods the room in a calming, low light. The white stall is wooden and impressively tall and the chair rail is a nice touch. The hand towel experience is refined, a basket on a pedestal and a small wire trash receptacle. The paint could use a touch up and the air was a little stagnant, but even with those issues I would highly recommend a visit. For the ambiance.	1
Have to confess, I&#39;m not impressed. Food was okay. Super heavy. Beer was okay. They have a decent happy hour. Parking lot in the back. Big tables for family style socializing. <br>TVs. It&#39;s German food. Nice staff. Just didn&#39;t leave too much of an impression for me and not top of my list to return, except maybe to try the outside seating area.	0
Yummy mocha and hot chocolate. Great breakfast for vegetarians and meat eaters, though not so good for vegans.	1
The menu sounds good, but it is not executed well and the service here is terrible.  If you are staying at the Renaissance, you are better off ordering room service, and you will get many of the items on the menu delivered to your room in 30 minutes.The &quot;we are all working together&quot; concept doesn't work-because noone knows when you need something or you are ready to order.  It took forever-like 20 minutes to get drinks (50% restaurant occupancy) and even longer to order.  We had to flag down the hostess to place our order because we didn't want to spend all night there.  I do not mind when there is a break between courses, but when we are all sitting there with empty plates and glasses, that's not a break, it's neglect.The food was so-so, because the service was terrible, it made the food taste worse.  The truffle mushroom appetizer was ok-the custard was wrong and out of place.  The pizza was cheese-soup.Sorry, but I have major buyers remorse for the amount of money I spent here.Get a glass of wine, but dine somewhere else.	0
WTF happened to this place? First time was amazing. Yea, spicy was probably a bit too spicy, but it was still very good and the soy garlic was so good, superior to BonChon or so that's what I remembered. This was about 3 years ago. Flash forward to July 2014. Was down in LA for a weekend and specifically bookmarked this place to eat at again, late night. I'm not even going to comment about the service, hours, etc. Just the chicken. I ordered the half/half and some fried wings for the hell of it, not knowing exactly what those were (I thought they're all fried?)I take it home, all excited (especially because I struck out a few days earlier when I tried to go there and it was closed) to eat and share with friends who hadn't tried it. First that white box you see in pictures has been replaced by a cardboard box. I'm not really complaining about that, but something was different already. I open up the box, and either they forgot the spicy, or they completely neutered it. The wings didn't even seem fried, more like grilled, without the sauciness that usually accompanies Korean wings. I can't even really explain them except that they were bad - dry, mediocre to nonexistent flavor. I had about 3 of the regular wings, and 1 fried wing before throwing in the towel. Friends did the same after politely saying they were decent, which of course was a big lie. Even the great Mary couldn't salvage them. To top it off, about an hour after eating a few wings, me and two other friends who had the displeasure of eating this stuff had stomach aches. Go figure.	0
This place cute but they totally rush you out. The food was so so. Wouldn&#39;t go back.	0
They have a fantastic happy hour from 4-6pm! A lot of stuff on the menu is only $6, including food, beer and wine. We enjoyed turkey sloppy joe sliders and a pizza, with the banana creme pie (Free to the Yelp check in!)Great service, too! We had no issues finding street parking right in front.	1
What a great restaurant what great food everything is awesome about this place, first thing to get is the Cuban coffee second for appetizers get some empanadas and then a sandwich or entree. We already bought two more coupons to come back here.	1
Gyro Cafe is delicious! Had the Lamb plate and WOW... Love this place! I will be coming again for some great food!	1
It&#39;s much better than any Jewish chain (like Jerry&#39;s) it may not be the best but it comes damn close!	1
The food is not bad considering the reviews. Overall, I would have rated the food as a 4 unfortunately the wait about killed the rating. We literally waited over an hour to receive our third course. The wait staff is attentive during delivery of food; other than that it&#39;s typical. The sushi chef did offer us food while we waited in all fairness. DON&#39;T come here if you&#39;re hungry or in a hurry. There&#39;re better yakitori type restaurants in LA or OC sans the ridiculous wait.	0
I just love the vibe of this restaurant, or cafe I should say. My friends and I were able to enjoy our brunch sitting outside. I tried the Coffee Cake Crusted French Toast with a cup of Toast coffee, and it was amazing. So delicious! And the staff is friendly. I would definitely come back when I'm in the area.	1
Great food and atmosphere - go for the hickory burger, fries, and a slice of banana or chocolate cream pie	1
This place rules, and what I imagine Bar Deville wishes it could be. <br><br>The decor is fantastic, and I love all the old antique chairs in the back room. All the drinks I had were excellent, and I don&#39;t even like gin! <br><br>The food was amazing as well -- I had the pork belly and the fries with aioli and I don&#39;t know how they make that aioli, but it was fantastic.<br><br>This might be my new go-to bar!	1
loving the vibe.. and the food ..couldve done better if they have more selection of bar drinks (most of the cocktails we requested they were out! even olives lol)<br>service..is a hit and miss especially on busy days or nights	1
Nice spot in pioneer square. I was here many years ago before Starbucks bought it. It used to have more character but is still nice and the coffee is good. The location with outdoor seating is great.	1
In my opinion this is the nicest restaurant in Madison. It is expensive but worth it. The view is great- floor to ceiling windows in the front of the restaurant provide great views of the Capitol. As one of the nicest restaurants in Madison the ambiance is formal and intimate but there is enough room in between the tables that you don't feel like you are a part of someone else's conversation. The cocktail menu is really unique and there are a lot of options (I hadn't even heard of some I the ingredients in the drinks). The menu changes regularly but I had the risotto with hazelnuts and brown butter as a second course and the scallops with sweet potato pure9e for my entree -both gluten free and delicious. The portions for both were perfect, larger than you would expect at a fine dining restaurant but not huge. I split the white chocolate banana bread pudding with chocolate custard with my boyfriend - it was really good and surprisingly gluten free! The staff is great. Our server was very attentive and walked me carefully through all of the gluten free menu options. Can't wait to come back in the summer and try some dishes!	1
This was the best meal we have enjoyed in a long time.  My friend looked up &quot;best game&quot;and Edgewater was the first place to come up.  He had a roast venison loin with parsnip and pear puree, brussel sprouts and sour cherry jus.  I could never imagine venison this tender and flavorful.  I had a venison carpaccio, similarly tender and flavorful, served with a quail egg, followed by a confit lamb shank with mixed bean ratatouille and a dash of grilled chorizo.  It fell off the bone alright, but in firm but tender bite sized pieces, and hardly any fat.  For &quot;dessert&quot; we shared a small cheese plate with 3 great selections.  The room is airy with wood beams and a view of Green Lake.  The service was impeccable; the waiter was attentive without hovering.  And the prices were quite reasonable considering what we got.  The restaurant is located in a lodge.  Well worth the short drive out of town.	0
Delicious food! Service is friendly and prices are very reasonable given the quality food. I&#39;ve been there three times and it is always consistently great.	1
Food too rough and salty. Pasta w greasy heavy cream. Atmosphere is bad and noisy. Pricy and not worth it. Won't come back anymore.	0
What's going on with the food here?Kale salad is mediocre with its off salad dressing. Off meaning it has a weird taste but cannot describe other than unpleasant:(The kale itself is of good quality ,hearty, great texture... But the flavor, other than its spicy little kick, is a mess.Don't mean to sound negative on the food here, but the pork steak and eggs.... Really not good! The pork taste so brined with spices that it was lost between a Moroccan ground kabob and an expired pork chop! Sorry.As for the atmosphere...really pretty bistro chic. Love that they did something so nice in the area, but the food I ate was a wreck!	0
Bomb gamjatang, samgyetang, galbi jjim...Everything I have tried here is just delicious.Portions are huge. Kimchi and kkakdoogi right thurr and I especially love the black rice mixed with white rice and beans (purple rice). Nooroongji (burnt rice with water) afterwards is the best part.	1
Fantastic burgers from this chain, served medium rare unless asked otherwise. My go-to is the Truffle Burger and Truffled fries. There's something innately comforting about the salt and black truffle-infused cheese used in both: it's really unbeatable. The servers here are all really very nice: quick, efficient, friendly. The bartenders are also great. My only complaint is that in the case of canned beer, they serve the can upside down in a pint glass. I have no idea what the thinking is behind this, but it's kind of disgusting. Aside from that, Umami makes a damn fine burger. The ice cream sandwiches are a wonderful antidote to kale-obsessed L.A. and well worth the caloric value.	1
The best food truck food ever. Found them when I was over at Vegas Streats about 2 months ago. Was so happy they were going to be at GES today because it&#39;s on my way home lunch! <br><br>Ordered 808 Nacho, da big boaz and pho-licious tacos. The tacos was the best with all the flavor! Yummy! Da big boaz was good except the meat was a bit chewy. 808, yummy as always!	1
Great ceviche and friendly service. The aji de gallina is delicious. Nice gem in this random strip mall.	1
A fantastic new spot. They&#39;ve got a great selection of signature cocktails that are delicious - the Hidalgo is a must!! Their chips and salsa were spot on, really flavorful salsas with a nice, crisp chip. Great variety of food choices, and it&#39;s currently limited menu as they just opened Wednesday! I had the chili relleno, which was good. I will say I&#39;m not wild about the fried chili, and it could&#39;ve used a tad more seasoning. My brother got the skirt steak and said it was delicious, melt in your mouth. <br><br>All in all, this is a great new neighborhood spot for some delicious Mexican food!	1
I was excited to try this place out since the reviews seemed great. Umm yeah, I've had way better pizza. What was the big deal I was expecting something delicious! All I got was some overly greasy and barely any crust or cheese on my pizza! The pizza was like a freaken slice of greasy paper! I'm very picky with my pizza's and I was very disappointed with this place. Won't be coming back.	0
My friends and I needed to find a Thai spot that opens late. BAM Yelp to the rescue and we crawled to this Thai Original. A very convenient location for USC students! I had low expectation for this place since I frequent the authentic Thai town in WeHo too often, but was pleasantly surprised!<br><br>Parking: dinky lot shared with other businesses. Eh just like everywhere else in K-town. <br><br>Service: decent... They&#39;re most Thai, yay I trust their authenticity now.<br><br>Food: 5 dishes consumed by 5 girls in a blink. <br><br>SPICY BEEF SALAD: 3/5 I like the kick of spice, just thought it was a little salty.<br><br>PAD SEE EW: 4/5 NOM I liked ours with beef<br><br>KAI YANG (B.B.Q. Chicken) 5/5: The chicken was so tender, fall off the bones paired delish honey sauce.<br><br>SEAFOOD COMBO SOUP: 4/5 Sooo much seafood. The soup base can be a little more flavorful but I was so hungry I didn&#39;t mind.<br><br>SPECIALTY CHICKEN CURRY 5/5 Oh my goodness, the chicken was super tender again and it feel off the bones... Thick sauce with potatoes. My friends loved this dish.<br><br>Overall, we left super satisfied. The staff were patient as we were the last party there. They didn&#39;t hush us out or anything. USC students... you can take a break from TG Express and come here for some legit Thai food :)	1
I went to Barley &amp; Brass on Friday night for dinner with a friend. Neither of us had been there before and we were seated almost immediately on the left side of the restaurant on the elevated section along the rail. The decor in this place is cool with a upscale yet rustic feel to it. The place was filled with a combination of overstuffed booths, high top tables, and lower tables, and if you sat anywhere other than a booth you were sitting on these cool metal chairs. The bar was massive and behind it was a giant chalk board with drink specials framed with shelving holding various bottles. Definitely pretty cool!<br><br>Our server stopped by and took our drink order very quickly and we were left to peruse the food menu. The menu has a variety of interesting sounding options however I was surprised how limited it was. There were a few entree options, a few appetizers, a few salads, and a few sandwich options, etc. but not exactly a big list of options. Neither of us were terribly hungry anyway so we decided on the chicken nachos and the grilled cheese with sweet potato fries. When our food arrived I was blown away how great the grilled cheese was. It was made with Brie cheese and had oven roasted grapes on it and the whole combination was incredible. Definitely one of the best grilled cheese sandwiches I have ever had! As for the nachos, these things were spicy. There were no jalapenos on them however the chicken was buffalo chicken. If you enjoy a little heat you&#39;ll love these however I couldn&#39;t finish more than a few of them. <br><br>Overall, the food was very good. I definitely would go back! The only negative thing about my experience was where we sat. Because our table was along the rail there was a high top table right next to us. Even with the music and noise from the dinner time crowd we could still hear every word of the couple next to us and I can only assume they heard every word of our conversation. 4 stars!	1
Wonderful! First time I went here fell in LOVE. The staff are all smiles when you walk in the door very welcoming. The service is the best in the area! And the food mouthwatering. The second time I brought my mom in from out of town and it was just as good (maybe better). Again the service is outstanding and the food is too! I look foward to the next time we go!	1
Girls should go because the food actually tastes good and the presentation is fine to look at. <br><br>Guys, stay the F away. Portions are tiny, even if they cut their price by 25% you&#39;ll still feel you are over paying for the amount of food they give you. <br><br>This is a hole in the wall place, but not hole in the wall price/portion.	0
Shhh, it's a hole in a wall so don't tell too many of your friends about Gastropod or it'll be mobbed! Oh wait, it's already mobbed. On a recent Saturday, 4 of us went early at 6:00pm to try to get a table at this fast-spreading-word-of-mouth place. Guess what, we had a wait. A group of 8 was hogging a table since when, lunch? By the time we got half a table (that's right, they only have communal tables that seat 8, so everybody has to share), there were already people waiting in the lobby. That's because there's literally no room to wait in this tiny restaurant -- just an 8-inch counter for your beer for about 2 people. The rest is bar seating for 8-9 and the 3 communal tables, that's it!	0
Main course (steak) well prepared, though sweetbreads did not add much.  Appetizer (fried clams) rather plain	1
i dont need to go all the way to queens just to eat a good sisig! excellent food and friendly service..feels like home..definitely coming back..	1
a big giant NO<br>HORRID food<br>I had the skirt steak <br>Came out fast <br>Stone cold stringy fries<br>Red wine 3 pours was generous<br> bananas&#39; oil rancid <br>bread butter ,rancid <br>oxtail soup decent flavor <br>vegetables mushy and nasty <br>this place was recommended <br>We hoped for GOOD CUBAN FOOD<br>The cost of this bad stuff $60,00<br>I think this is one of those restaurants that has existed for half a century and doesn&#39;t need to keep up with the times and doesn&#39;t CARE Just chugs along ,oblivious to <br>how food has evolved<br>SAD	0
I mean, its a cool looking place. The food is good and the customer service is good. Why not the 5 star rating? They didn&#39;t WOW me.	1
A friend and I wanted to try this place out for a study spot because it had such great reviews. Unfortunately, there were no seats available when I arrived there to study. So..I stayed a total of a minute...and told my friend not to come. I am hoping I can go early one day to get a seat and actually try out their drinks. Maybe I will have a better review then.	0
Pizza Brutta may be my favorite restaurant in the Monroe neighborhood, which is a mighty feat. They make excellent single serving pizzas, as well as very good & reasonably priced salads. This is because of their ingredients. They locally source nearly everything, from the meats, the veggies, the cheese, and even the beers, and it shows. It doesn't hurt that they also cook the pizzas Neapolitan style, so it makes the crust thin, crispy, and tasty enough to eat alone! My go to pizza there is the cremini, which is just flat out delectably savory with the fried onions, mushroom puree, and fried mushrooms. If you can take mushrooms, it's a real treat, and it ranks highly among my favorite madison pizzas. And don't forget to check in there on Yelp! They have a deal where you can get a free bread and oil.	0
Definitely worth checking out in DTLA. Amazing atmosphere and speechless scenery.. can&#39;t get better than this! <br><br>Came here around 10pm on Thursday, not a lot of people so we were able to get seats. Only got 2 drinks here, a little pricey but you pay for the environment. It&#39;s located in a hotel so you have to take an elevator up to the 13th floor (restaurant), after they let you in, you can either walk up or take another elevator to the 16th floor.	1
I love love love to brunch here! The service is usually pretty decent for a bottomless mimosa place. If it gets too busy the servers usually do a small carafes of champagne for your table to not keep you waiting!!! <br><br>Food is always fun and pretty good. Think big greasy pretty plates! Get whatever has the mini waffles bc they are the cutest!! 90 min table limit so bottoms up! Would I come for non-mimosas not sure.	1
Slow service &amp; okay food. The only thing I liked was the duck. The pad thai was overly sweet &amp; wet. The beef salad was chewy but the duck was good. It was however $25 for the duck. The meal came out to $70, which is a lot for 2 ppl eating Thai. I would not recommend this place nor would I ever return.	0
I wanted to love this place so badly, but if failed all expectations due to TERRIBLE SERVICE. We made a last minute reservation for a Friday night, and they happily accommodated us. However, upon being sat, everything went downhill. It took 20 minutes for our first round of drinks to be brought to the table, and we only ordered wine. Our appetizer (pate, which was great, but we had to ask and wait 10 minutes for more mustard), came before the wine. We ordered our second glasses of wine when the first were sat down as a result of the first delay, and exact same result. We were almost finished with our entre9e before our 2nd glass of wine, which we specifically ordered for the entre9e arrived. Once it did arrive, my wine was so terrible that I couldn't drink it. However, our server never came back to the table to check on us, after being so attentive to the tables on either side of us. Eventually, I had to return the wine to the bar myself.	1
What the hell is this? I ordered two tacos and what did I get? One giant wtf is this taco. I came here because of its great yelp reviews and I suspect all of those are from white people not from San Francisco who don't know what a good taqueria is. I Live not to far from this place and I never went in before because it looks too fancy which to me means expensive, little portions, and non-authentic and that is exactly what I did indeed get. This is not an authentic taqueria it is an American-Mexican taqueria like Pancho Villa or ChipotleThe taco tasted like it was made by some hippie putting only "green" ingredients in. Yes the ingredients seem to be fresh and the whole place seems sanitary, and the people are nice, but thats where the good ends. I guess I shouldn't be to harsh the taco was ok, but I had to use a fork since it was twice as large as a real taco you cant hold it while eating it. I wanted to eat it outside but had to go back home to eat it because I needed the fork.Point is when SF has so many great taquerias why would anyone settle for this one? Answer is, its for people that don't know no better.	0
I won&#39;t try and beat Kyle&#39;s 1st and brilliant review but thanks to Kyle<br>I made a little trek one lunchtime and scored myself a pastrami sandwich. My only complaint is that the bread is a little thin to hold the enormous amount of meat, and when you eat the sandwich it either spreads mustard all over you or the meat falls out. But all is forgiven when you taste the pastrami... Great neighbourhood find.	1
When we arrived we requested a table near the window to enjoy the view of the strip and they immediately fixed a table for us so we did enjoy the view. We were celebrating our 37th anniversary and our sever complimented us with a special dessert and greetings from the staff.Very courteous waiter and the food and wine was excellent as always.	1
If you're a girl, you'll like this place. If you have a gf, bring her here. If you have a mother-in-law, bring her here. You get the point...This is one of those restaurants that WOMEN seem to love. Everytime I go, the restaurant is filled with women (mostly Korean). But guys, don't be scared to try this place out because the food is delicious!! I think the main reason why there are so many women is because it's a "slim & healthy" restaurant so they have a good variety of salads, whole wheat pasta, very thin crust pizza, etc...My favorites are probably the PASTAS AND PIZZAS! Its not too cheesy/salty/greasy and doesn't make you feel too guilty afterwards either since it was whole wheat..... lolThey also serve you this olive bread beforehand and its pretty good, I wish it was warm/toasted though. They also have icecream, smoothies, coffee, desserts, etc. Dr.Robbin is unique because when you walk in, you order at the cashier first, then you take a number and find a seat. The servers will bring out the complimentary bread and your dishes to your table. Water is self-serve. The waiters are all very friendly and nice.Don't be fooled by the signage outside because at first, you may think it's a doctor's office or a plastic surgery clinic but its definitely NOT.PARKING is my only complaint because the lot they have is tinyy and filled up. Try street parking (beware of street cleaning).	1
Really nice atmosphere and decor. Very romantic. Food failed to impress except for desserts!! Most of the highlights don&#39;t exist anymore as their chef changed last January.	1
We had been referred by a friend who had been many times and raved about the place.  Good customer service, loved the wine and the fact that it was included in the meal  The salad was really  nice and fresh. Did not care for the bread as it  felt grainy in my mouth when eating.  We both ordered the seafood fettuccine and were terribly disappointed.  The seafood was overcooked and did not have a good flavour, the sauce had no flavour and the pasta was over cooked and tasteless.  We could hardly even eat the food. Maybe it was just a bad dish  as the wonderful reviews just puzzle us as to what happened.  We had to get to a show so we didn't bother to ask for anything else to replace it.  Just paid our bill and left.	0
Love Dirt Dog!!! Family friendly, Dirt Dog Cool, great folks with impeccable service. Dirt Dog to die for!!! A little pricey but totally worth it!	1
Piola looks like a a trendy, clean cafeteria, the servers are super friendly, the menu is large, but sadly the food sucks. I was feeling so adventurous tonight when ordering the napoli pizza which had anchovies, black olives, fresh mozzarella, basil and sun-dried tomatoes that I even went so far as to announce that I was going to go big or go home. What happened is I went home hungry. My pizza tasted like a salt lick, it was so salty that I could barely eat it. I am also not a fan of the Italian style of pizza which at Piola, has a ridiculously thin, soggy crust, too much cheese and wasn&#39;t filling at all. <br><br>The bf got a sausage pizza, which I also didn&#39;t like. Again, there was the crust and cheese issue, but additionally his was super oily.<br><br>The chairs in there are also horribly uncomfortable. They hit you right in the middle of the lower back. I recommend skipping this place.	0
Yeah, after at least four different times of ordering the chow mein and drunken noodles, we've gotten the grossest chicken which was basically 100 percent fat and gristle. A bit oily too for my liking. Meh. Probably wont be ordering again.	0
Shark-fin soup? Seriously? That's totally unacceptable.	0
Diablo Taco is yummy! They have great tacos and great beer! My favorite was the maple fried chicken, so good! I would defiantly recommend checking this place out. If you like good food and good drinks you will like Diablo! The tacos are so creative and fun I had a hard time not eating everything on the menu. I think their take on tacos is delicious and exciting. Way to go Diablo!	1
Best haitian food in Miami. Period. Location is NOT the best. But they do have a drive thru, it&#39;s best to call in advance to place your order. Only complaint is that even if you call in advance, you&#39;ll still be waiting in drive thru for quite some time. But it iFRESH off the stove and is def worth the wait. The fried shrimp platter w/the special yellow sauce on the side...rice, beans and plantains....OMG! Even if I&#39;m full, I have to finish it up till there is nothing left. Amazing!	1
Came here for a michelada and though the popsicle was a cool concept, it falls totally short in practicality and taste. First problem with it is you cant just order n drink it. You have to wait for the popsicle to melt, which in a cold beer you can imagine how long that takes. You&#39;ve already drank a third of th e beer by that time. Secondly, the popsicle itsself is watered down. If you want a real michelada, this is disappointing. <br><br>Service is good, parking is bad, pricing is steep but I cant speak for the food	0
Love the ambience and overall vibe. This place is huge! You can sit on the patio, at the bar, communal tables, upstairs.. Oh and don&#39;t forget the photo booth upstairs.<br><br>Drinks are amazing! Perfect for happy hour. My suggestion: Order a speciality cocktail and a burger.	1
for my 100th review, i feel like i should review one of my most favoritest spots everrr...the place i affectionately refer to as 'PP'.i discovered this spot on my daily commute down pico and happened to come in the first week they opened. total love at first sight. since that first visit, i have spent hundreds of hours here studying, socializing, and staring at people. i have listened to first dates, breakups, cancer announcements, fights, etc. i also watched rebecca black (yes, of "friday" fame) film her 2nd music video in the dance studio here. ~*highlight of 2011*~i'm that annoying girl who sits here for like 12 hours straight, cracked out studying, and only orders a latte. no one has ever given me shit. everyone is as nice as they need to be. and parking is never a problem. LOVE IT.	1
Have never seen a place so hungry for money... but when u try their food, u understand why.<br>I ordered their homemade gnocchi. It came out so fast within less than 5 minutes and tasted as if it was frozen. It actual hardly had any flavor and was sort of undercooked.<br>They never even had the decency to offer something else instead or to ask what was wrong.<br>They never even apologized about it.<br>They simply removed the plate almost untouched and handed me the bill.<br>Once again, very very hungry for money that they have no sense of decency or customer satisfaction.	0
I thought it was a great restaurant based on the 4-star average reviews, but it is not that good. We ordered a fried thai noodles, house steak, Miami heat roll, eel roll and other appetizers, so that we could try different styles of Asian food. Steak didn&#39;t taste like steak, more like boiled beef with soy sauce, the rolls had too much cream and the rice was hard, the fried crystal noodles was salty. If you want good Asian food, I won&#39;t recommend this one.	0
Loved the gachapas, the best since left Venezuela .	1
I found a bug (looked like a worm) in my sul lung tang and it came from the kimchi. I had taken it to-go and when I called to complain, they did NOT apologize but instead said that it&#39;s NORMAL to have bugs in kimchi. Their excuse was that bugs naturally form inside the sae-woo jut but... Anyway, after that experience, I&#39;m never going there.	0
Welcome to a West LA institution that has been nearly untouched by time for over sixty years. My dad grew up off of Westwood Blvd and has told me stories of being a kid and riding his bicycle to the Apple Pan for lunch in the 50's and 60's. My dad claims this restaurant is still "exactly the same" as when he was a child. I've personally been going to the Apple Pan for over twenty years and have never had a bad meal. The restaurant is like a small house with a lunch counter inside. Most of the servers have been there for as long as I can remember. The menu is simple and the food is excellent. I've always enjoyed the hickory burger (which I believe is the same as the steakburger, but only with BBQ sauce.) Sodas are served from cans into white paper cones that sit inside a holder which is a very cool authentic vintage touch. They have great apple pie and it's even better ala mode. The only major negative is that the parking is really tough. There is a small lot behind the restaurant, but good luck on that one. I usually just end up parking on the street and walking over. It also gets really crowded inside the restaurant and people end up having to stand while waiting for a counter seat. I remember a few years ago two friends of mine went there for lunch and two guys tried to snag the seats they were waiting for. It almost broke out into a fist fight and one of the old waiters with a white paper hat had to break the whole thing up! LOL!!!To me the parking and waiting issues are a small price to pay for a restaurant this awesome. I feel very lucky that this restaurant is not only still here, but is maintained as well as it is. I love the Apple Pan and it's truly one of the last original pieces of "Americana" left in a section of the city that has become increasingly diverse over the last fifty years.	1
WOWOWOWOW! been a while since a city establishment earned a 5-star rating in my book. My friend who introduced me to this unbelievable gem said it best: I&#39;ve lost all motivation to cook at home (he lives in Bucktown within walking distance so he&#39;s not even playin). The prices ($8-$12) for the bibimbap are ridiculous! How do they do it?? Such generous servings of visually appealing, brightly colored veggies with beef/pork/sashimi (depending on which one you order) served in a ginormous bowl! 2 people could easily share 1 order...but don&#39;t do that because this place is too good for sharing. <br><br>The interior of the restaurant is aesthetically curious relative to the menu....kinda looks like it&#39;s a cafe inside of an ex-Anthropologie! Cute.....but odd. I like how it&#39;s so casual and quick and yet SUPER HEALTHY and an amazing deal! If there was stock for this place I would buy ALL OF IT because I am 150% confident that En Hakkore dominates other quasi fast-food restaurants (such as Chipotle). It&#39;s not even right that the phrase &#34;fast-food&#34; is in the same review as En Hakkore....but honestly they are super fast! could there be anything better than super fast, super fresh, super cheap, korean cuisine??? no, there couldn&#39;t be. <br><br>you gotta GOGOGOGOGO! to say that i ****LOOVEEEEEEE**** this place is a big understatement. Let&#39;s just say, I ate here 2 days in a row and would have continued on to day #3 but they&#39;re closed on sundays. also, GET THE TACOS! 2 come in a naan-esque shell. they were so yummy that i chowed them down even though i already couldn&#39;t button my pants from the bimbimbap. <br><br>can i franchise this joint or what??<br><br>p.s. i find it weird that people are criticizing the &#34;limited&#34; menu here. Yea, the menu has only a few items (bibimbap, kimbap, and tacos)...but you&#39;re completely missing the point of the establishment if you think that&#39;s bad. It&#39;s a plus that they embraced what they can do best and then they deliver every time. Also, think about it: in what scenario would anyone bet the success of their restaurant on basically 1 dish?? Yea, it&#39;s *that* good. <br><br>if you want a regular menu go to a regular korean restaurant, duh. this place is a super fresh super fly fusion specialty house (korean with hints of indian and mexican and california - &#34;whaaa? korean w indian &amp; mexican &amp; californian?? that can&#39;t be right,&#34; u say! but no, don&#39;t fret - you&#39;ll be great.). fingers crossed En Hakkore goes global!<br><br>warning: they put cilantro on pretty much everything. I HATE CILANTRO. you can ask them to not put it on anything.	1
I wish this place existed in other places (like the Bay Area), everytime we go to LA my mouth automatically starts watering while I remember the boar bacon, the garlic roasted potatoes, skillet eggs and blueberry ricotta pancakes. It's a tad dark inside but hey, if you're hungover its a great place to recover and let the eyes adjust slowly. Mmm mimosas!	1
We were there today and ordered two mojitos, just finished lunch across the street and wanted to grab a cocktail. Closed out, and before I could even take a sip and got the bill, it was $12 each and they charged me for gratuity. I payed $30 for two small mojitos! Wtf! My lunch for two with appetizers, wine, and coffee at Exquisito was $23. I left with a sugary bad taste in my mouth. What a rip off!!! Great building tho. My question is why do you charge gratuity for two drinks, as a customer that should be my decision. Are you afraid your service is that bad that I won&#39;t leave gratuity? I guess you&#39;re right, your service is bad.	0
If you only read the first sentence: DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE. Went on a Tuesday night for a friends birthday dinner. We were a party of 20, but that&#39;s no excuse to give poor/non existent service. It was taco night for unlimited tacos. $15. Sounds like a good deal. The tacos came out family style, forcing us to share with strangers at this dinner. That was weird considering they took everyone&#39;s order individually. Whoever was expediting the food was obviously too lazy and inexperienced to handle placing 3 tacos together on a plate. The server disappeared and would drop items without checking to see if we needed refreshments on our over priced drinks. Who messes up sangria?? Batch does. I suspect this location will last awhile only because it&#39;s in a good area. Once everyone tries it once though, I doubt they&#39;ll be recieiving any repeat business. Terrible food, terrible service.	0
I've been here a few times and every time the ramen is pretty good or pretty bad. The quality is a hit or miss depending on what day you go I guess. This time it was a miss.I had the spicy miso ramen. The ramen noodles were good, the cha siu was a bit thick and it was super chewy, and menma was hard and crunchy. The soup was alright; can't really tell with the spiciness masking it.The service is good and quick.	0
We took our children with us to this restaurant. We weren't expecting it to be quite so 'grown up' - there was no children's menu and after sitting down, we wondered if we should stay! But, the restaurant did an excellent job of keeping the kids entertained with crayons and toys and helping us all feel welcome. They were very accommodating with their food options for all of us, nothing was too much trouble. I will wait until the kids are teenagers before taking them back, but it is an excellent restaurant for couples and adult groups. Highly recommended.	0
Oh, man does this place suck so much it&#39;s unbelievable.<br><br>My poor date...I took a girl here today for lunch and we ordered a pizza margherita. About 2 minutes later the waiter came back with a pizza. &#39;Yeah, it only takes 90 seconds,&#39; he said. I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s a crust that is somehow pre-baked, upon which they have dumped some of the nastiest, wateriest tomato sauce I have ever seen. It looked like someone had dribbled melted red Popsicle all over the dough. Sick, dude! Then to achieve the &#39;artisan&#39; pizza look you see in the photos, lumps of cheese are sporadically thrown across the pie. I&#39;m just glad I only wasted $11 on this pizza. Both my date and I were on the verge of sending it back and getting something else, but since the problem was the sauce, we guessed anything else on the menu would be lacking in that department, as well.<br><br>And I see below that the proprietor of this place has been responding to negative reviews on the sauce from the last month or so...if you read, this, I&#39;m sorry, but the sauce is awful.	0
Great view of the harbor and ocean, with wonderful sunsets.	1
Hello all,<br>Be aware the egg is not cooked on the french toast. We ended up not eating half of it cuz it tasted funny. Price is overrated for the portion, so just be aware. Most importantly, the place is way too tight. Dark and little depressing.	0
I went there for a birthday lunch with a friend. The waitress was slow taking our order and then we waited 45 minutes for our food. I had ordered Copper River salmon the most expensive item on the menu and I received two little pieces each about 1 inch in diameter.	0
Tasty food but outrageously overpriced -- even for lunch. It must not bother people because the place was full (probably business lunches on the company expense account...)	1
Always a good time coming here with coworkers after a long shift at work, very friendly bartenders and awesome drinks and games they have, a vibing spot !	1
Do not come here for breakfast. I stopped eating as soon as I realized I had to cut my pancakes with a knife. The coffee is bitter and the small pastries they give you before your meal are unremarkable. The rest of the group I was with had the same dismal experience.	0
When I read that Bar Boulud was opening in Boston I was so excited. I loved my visits to db Bistro, Cafe Boulud and Daniel in NYC. I thought this would be such a great addition to the Boston restaurant scene. I WAS WRONG. Le Voile, Butcher Shop, Aquitaine, Le Petit Robert and Mistral you have no competition here. In general the entire meal was unremarkable but the duck was inedible. The color of the sauce should have been the first clue to send it back. It was purple. It was the worst duck I have ever had. There are much better choices in Boston	1
Usually with all Chinese restaurant is that the dirtier the place is the better the food tastes. However, this place was so dirty I wanted to scrub myself with bleach afterward. The wall was dirty and on the floor was food and other unknown particles. Had 3 items:1) Beef Stew Noodle Soup: The soup should be rich and hearty, but it was watery and laden with msg.2) Pan Fried Lamp Dumpling: Didn't spend the time to fry the dumpling until it was golden brown and crispy. Somehow the ones from Noriega taste way better. 3) Shanghai Dumpling: From the waitress, it was supposed to be one of their top dish. Eh..........I had better and have been spoiled for many years with Ding Tai Fung in L.A. Next to us was actually a Shanghainese couple they had this OMG face after eating the dumpling, but not in a good way. I was thinking I totally feel youSo save your time, don't try this place and go to their other place in Noriega to buy a bag of frozen Lamb Dumpling, yum for me but not for everyone 'cause it does have a animal taste (don't know the correct term, whoever can tell me what is the correct terminology would be great) =)	0
If you haven&#39;t been here yet, go. If you are looking to impress a date, client or just have a nice happy hour with some friends you are in for a treat. You enter the elevator through in an elegant lobby and are greeted 2/3 of the way up by another gentlemen who takes you the the elevator which leads to perch. You walk in to a very upscale restaurant and bar with a very pleasant staff. I suggest making a reservation and request seating outside near the glass walls because you have amazing unobstructed views of the LA skyline. There are heaters and fireplaces throughout the outdoor seating area too. <br><br>As for the drains, all good. Food I have had the Filet which was good and my date had the Chilean Seabass which was amazing. For appetizers and happy hour I suggest the mixed nuts. They are delicious. So do yourself a favor and head over to Perch. I just heard that they are doing Sunday Brunch now too so that should be a great spot on Sunday Funday!	1
Awesome rooftop bar with great view. They have heaters. We came for happy hour to enjoy sunset from the rooftop:)	1
Food is just OK and service is just about as bad as it gets. There are many options for Pho on Broadway go somewhere else.	0
Every time I got to carrabbas its amazing service, food, and over all environment. But this carrabbas felt extra nice there was no wait went directly in and then to the table. The waitress Christine(I believe was her name) was very friendly, knowledgable and <br>just and all around great person. Food was delivered on time and cooked perfectly with no details missed, got a tomato basil soup as our starter, that was so good alone it would of been a great meal, but the ever classic chicken parm they make there is delicious and has nothing to be envious of other restaurants. Best experience in a while since it&#39;s so hard to find that here in Miami sometimes. The only knock was the hostess was a little snarky and said &#34;it&#39;s going to be noisy everywhere&#34; when we requested to sit in a quieter location farther from the bar where a large party was but after the waitress came and again address the noise issue and asked if we would like to sit outside, so honestly we forgot about what the hostess had said and enjoyed our night.	1
I wouldn't give this a one star. 1) Walked in the front door and was not acknowledged by any of the staff.2) Stood there for about 2 minutes until finally getting service.3) Sat outside the waitress stepped on my shoes, and was insincere with her apology.4) Waited almost 20 minutes for 1 appetizer and 1 entree in an EMPTY restaurant with no other dining customers.5) Never followed up with our opinion of the food.Overall bad service, bad food, don't waste your time or money!RATING: GARBAGE!	0
I loved the sea food platter. WOW - it comes with 2 lobster tails, Tiger shrimp, green lips mussels, calamari, and 2 white fish filets - all grilled and healthy. The price? .... just $49. It goes very well with Vino Verde, the popular Portuguese white wine that is so difficult to find in most US restaurants.	1
I am hooked... <br><br>Found Dave&#39;s food at the Studio City Farmer&#39;s Market yesterday... <br><br>Brought home a tub of BBQ Tofu and Tempeh.... Almost gone. <br><br>Will be back for more soon!	1
First, this place is open 24/7. Major plus for late night cravings. And plus, it's pretty spacious, so usually no problem getting seated right when you walk in. Had the sulungtang, $5.99. For the price, it was perfect! I'm definitely used to shelling out a few more bucks at other Korean places. Great broth, tender meat, and stone pot rice to mix in. The gakduki (spicy radish) was so good! I also hear the gamja tang is really good here too...will have to try it next. But yea, I'm definitely coming here for my sulungtang fix :)Side note, they have their own parking lot, I think it's usually valet, but when I came during lunchtime on Saturday, we rolled on in without having to worry about valet. Wooo.	1
I came here for a delicious bite and swig with some girlfriends and @IsawJesusinLA aka Kevin grabbing a drink at the bar. It gets pretty breezy sitting in the shade of the museum so dress accordingly. My cocktail, Ginger Rogers was a lovely summer refresher. Drinks are $16 and under, but well made. There is NO Happy Hour, and the kitchen does not start serving until 5PM. However there is a special Egg night menu served on Mondays only which we ordered from.Pilota - soft poached egg, crispy farro, pork belly, broccoli, scallion, fermented chile $15Spaghetti - lobster, uni, wild ramps, dashi, crunchy buckwheat, egg yolk $26	1
Big portions, average food	0
It was good! But after seeing the other review with the roach in her stew... it made me cringe to think what if my stew was a roach stew and not a mixed guts stew. EEEEK! not like mixed guts stew sounds any better... but it was good!Let's hope it was not a roach stew!	1
Far Bar is a popular spot in Little Tokyo, probably thanks to their quaint outdoor seating which you access through a short alleyway. The outdoor nook is situated between brick buildings and decorated with hanging lights. It reminds me of New York, or what I would assume a fine summer evening in New York would feel like. <br><br>There are two interiors, a small, cramped red bar room that always looks packed, and further in, a spacious, ambiently-lit dining area. There is a bar in there too, a television, and the music is a selection of indie favorites.<br><br>They have a wide selection of beers; lots of imports. I have no complaints. But I&#39;m here to comment about the bar food because it is really great. For $5, you can buy a reasonably-sized roti shrimp pizza, which is amazing. Then there&#39;s the ever-popular wasabi fries, and they have a nice array of sushi. Again, for inexpensive bar food, I&#39;ve heard nothing but compliments from the people who&#39;ve tasted it.<br><br>Since Far Bar is a happening place, expect that it will be crowded upon arrival, especially further into the night. The outdoor seating is usually full as is the bar room, so I would mosey on into the dining room unless being with throngs of people is your thing.<br><br>It is a nice place to go during happy hour, around twilight before the nighttime after-party rush, and once I was able to experience a live jazz performance to go with my meal.	1
For anyone who you are bringing in from out of town Super Subs&#39;s is a must. If you have never been there and you are a Miami native it is also a must. It has been there for years and the food is awesome. I would recommend it to anyone who needs a joint to take out of townees to munch!!	1
My review feels pointless, what with 1300 some-odd other reviews. But nonetheless....	0
I love this place. The staff is friendly, the new chef has meticulously prepared, delicious seasonal food, and the vibe is very cool and comfy. Feels like a creative space but without the attitude. They don&#39;t want you to camp out with a laptop at the front dining tables but you can work at the back tables or at any of the bar seats or upstairs.	1
kyochon is the best friend chicken i have ever had. hands down. no questions asked.	1
the food is great here! especially the sushi!	1
This is primarily a review for the drinks & the view, which were both amazing!! The worst part of downtown of course is the whole parking situation...but it was worth it! Prices were on the higher side, but nothing out of the ordinary for a LA bar. I had the "My Fair Lady," which was nice and fruity :p I went when it was not as crowded, but when I walked out a TON of people were waiting outside in line...which I don't think I would've done lol It was nice that we were able to just walk in!	1
I was at Wynwood Kitchen and Bar, and I must say that the food is very bad and also the pricing for that food is crazy. And other thing I don&#39;t like about this place is that they don&#39;t allow dogs at the outside area. Very disappointing, my recommendation to you is not to visit this place. BAD FOOD &amp; PET NOT FRIENDLY	0
Miam is an excellent bistro-style restaurant in Wynwood. I&#39;ve had breakfast and lunch there on a number of occasions and their consistently high quality, use of local ingredients and great service continue to impress me. I recommend the veggie quiche and the roast beef sandwich for lunch--just make sure you ask them to heat them up for you since you&#39;re definitely not in a rush.	1
It was my first time and it was delicious! Everything was great, my boyfriend and I enjoyed everything. Let me tell you the drinks were outstanding! We both got a very good buzz on! The appetizer was out of this world! We got the lobster pop-tart, it's a must!!! I got the birds eye view and my boyfriend got the lamb. Both plates were scrumdiliumcious! A nice unique place to go to for a special occasion. The one thing that I didn't like was that the tables are a little to close to each other but other then that it's a nice restaurant.	1
Love love love this place. Most breweries have one beer that is great but you can order a flight here and enjoy every flavor. And bonus the food is excellent! The curry hand battered pork with rice is the best meal I've had in Seattle!!!!!	1
went there for their always amazing "monday supper". Drove across town only to discover they were out of the nights offering. Bummer. We decided to stay any way and pay twice what we were expecting, but at the end of the dinner the hostess offered to buy us dessert. Impressive display of customer service that I rarely see anymore. Of course.. lol.. they forgot to actually deduct it from the bill forcing me awkwardly to say something, but an honest mistake. All in all, an excellent experience. Have never had a bad meal here and they really do what they do well.	1
lol. was here on Wednesday and the price for the set meal was still $9. now, on Sunday, it&#39;s $15 -- didn&#39;t take long!<br><br>still worth a shot though, good food in rare style	1
I&#39;m not Scandinavian, but I am from Seattle and a lot of my friends are swede/wegie Midwesterners, so I have a general understanding of the food scene. and good lord this place is great. I had the best brioche of my life here and if my french pals found out, they&#39;d die. it was perfect. I had the shrimp roll and it was A++++. The staff were SO nice and they checked in on is a few times to make sure everything was okay with our meal, which was really sweet. 10/10 will come here often!	1
Been coming here for YEARS (close to a decade).... still not sick of it. I stick with the steak tacos, although burritos are good.	0
Never mind that Mall of the Americas has become my favorite mall in Miami, this is stuff for a different review, but housed in the mall, is OTG. In our new quest to eat as healthy as possible, especially when eating out we found Off the Grille Bistro, lured in primarily by the suitable choices in their menu, we hadn&#39;t even read the other reviews about this place.<br><br>A very generous, tasty, cooked to order grilled vegetable wrap we quite possible one of the best we have ever had. This is a testament to the chefs meticulous desire to get it right, he listened to our order, acknowledged and went to work, and the results were perfect !<br><br>Extra star for follow through, the chef stepped out from the behind the counter and solicited our feedback, again he listened , offered a few suggestions for our next visit and made us feel just a little bit extra special, which in addition to his wonderful cooking skills, make the place stand just above others.<br><br>The options are quite diverse, and I am quite certain that there is something in their menu that will please and satisfy just about any request.	1
I was really looking forward to eating here but the overall experience was hit and miss. Some of the menu items were very good while others were a struggle to enjoy.	0
Ok, so I really wanted to like this place. Let&#39;s start that we came here for Father&#39;s Day and had reservations for 12:30PM and we were not sat until 12:45PM. It was so packed inside that you were constantly tripping or bumping into people. It smelled like vomit inside of there and it was so hot that we were sweating in there. Service was meh, we had to continuously find our server for water and we were only served the unlimited mimosas once. They have an omelet station with some minimal other breakfast items. They have a carving stations and the only good thing from that was the pork, but we didn&#39;t come here for pork. We are in Miami for pete&#39;s sake we can have pork anywhere for a quarter of the price. They had an overcooked pasta, rice that smelled rancid. Well, I think you get the drift. Not worth the money. The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because the kids had fun taking pictures outside with all the need stuff and watching the planes take off from the airport.	0
HOLY. KIMCHI . FRIED . RICE .<br><br>I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s what I had last night.<br><br>Albeit it was a Thursday night and I had to wait an hour and did not get seated until 10pm (well into my bed time)...it was well worth it.<br><br>I have been on the search for the perfect kimchi fried rice for YEARS ever since I got split with my favorite place in norcal and I am so happy that I finally found the place!<br><br>If kimchi isn&#39;t really your thing, don&#39;t be afraid. The kimchi fried rice is not laden with humongous chunks of kimchi like other places I&#39;ve tried and the entire dish is very flavorful without being overbearingly spicy and pickled tasting. Making it easy to eat just on its own or with any other dishes you have. And if it wasn&#39;t wonderful enough, the thing that took me over the moon and back was that perfectly runny egg resting on top of it all. I read all the previous reviews describe how wonderful the egg was and thought, that&#39;s great but how amazing can an egg really be? WELL I WAS WRONG. IT WAS THE MOST DELICIOUS UNDERCOOKED RUNNY EGG I HAVE EVER CONSUMED. Pop that sucker open and let it mix into your fried rice. It&#39;s gooey texture was a match made in heaven with the slightly crisped/burned pieces of fried rice being constantly heated by the giant stone bowl it came in. <br><br>The size small is $8 (comes with one egg) and will easily fill up 2 people. However, this is what we came for so we opted for the large for $12 which came out with 2 beautiful eggs!<br><br>As for the pots, we shared an individual size of the Boot Knocker which comes with all your favorite canned meats like Spam and Vienna sausages. The amount of actual ramen in the bowl was non existent. Maybe like 2 spoonfuls which I didn&#39;t really care for anyways because in such a hot broth, the ramen gets extremely overcooked and soggy. The broth is very very flavor packed and can&#39;t really be eaten like soup because it was pretty salty. Then again my experience with korean pots/soups are pretty non existent so maybe it&#39;s just not my thing. <br><br>I probably wouldn&#39;t be getting another pot ... but I would definitely wait another hour to get another taste of the magnificent kimchi fried rice.<br><br>And hey, any place I can get my grub on while grooving to some Jagged Edge and KC &amp; Jojo deserves some serious props!	1
Flies Galore.<br><br>If I were to title this review, that would be it. Went for breakfast once, upon entry I saw flies everywhere. These guys need to seriously do something about the pest issue. It was really hard to enjoy the food when you are constantly fighting off flies from landing on your meal. I would return a second time, maybe in a month or two and see if the there&#39;s less flies this time around.	0
If you&#39;re looking for really authentic or fusion Thai, then you&#39;ve come to the wrong place. The Original Thai BBQ Restaurant isn&#39;t fancy or hip, but it serves a purpose. That purpose is to provide quick, inexpensive, and satisfying food. Kind of like a Thai version of Denny&#39;s. Original Thai BBQ has been around for years and the menu has stayed the same for the most part. Their Kai Yang is still my favorite version of Thai BBQ Chicken, and I&#39;ve tried a lot of variations since I was seven years old (before most people knew what Thai food was). The servings of beef or chicken Sate (or Satay) are plentiful. I&#39;ve ordered Sate at other Thai restaurants where only three or four pieces are served, at a higher price. The soups are good, as well as some of their vegetarian dishes. I am also a fan of their Phad See-Ew. It&#39;s nice and greasy. The Sen-Yai Rard-Nar (or Rad Na) is a fav too.	1
Rob at the bar and Alex the waitress really excel. Great specialty drinks and happy hour.	1
The help is so slow and apathetic I'm convinced they really don't care if I ever come back. So I'll go to bainbridge bakers from now on.	0
Just back from a long trip to New York, I had no food in the house and was craving some San Francisco comfort. And what says SF better than a burrito? Well, my chicken burrito at Papalote was more like a slap in the face than a warm embrace. Dry, dry, dry. No flavor. And at $8, I felt downright ripped off. Sure, it came with a small container of their fantastic salsa but the chips tasted like they came out of one of those giant Costco sized bags that you can get for $3.No fucking bueno.	0
Cliff's Edge has a new chef, and I couldn't possibly be more pleased. In fact, I was actually there twice this week...Dropped in for dinner with vegetarian friends on a Thursday night. Highlights of the meal were the burrata salad (grilled pears with sweet and creamy mozzarella burrata made for a magnificent pairing... who would've thunk?!) and the taleggio risotto (fragrant beyond belief... love, love, love). Very satisfying.Stopped by again on Sunday for brunch - this time with my three month-old baby girl. She loved staring at the strings of edison bulbs hanging from above, and I loved that the magical space kept her busy enough for me to inhale a really lovely frisee salad- one topped with bacon and a poached egg.The restaurant's food has finally caught up with its magical ambience. I look forward to returning again soon.	1
never disappoints	1
So first based on fact that this is in Vegas not that it&#39;s nem noung so for your cravings yeah!!!<br><br>The spring roll not as good I think the meat was less fresh or had been sitting longer prob cause not as busy <br><br>The banh koht was ok. Somewhat crispy<br>The grilled pork not so good I&#39;m used to a bit sweet and salty this was just salty <br><br>And they didn&#39;t have small orders of pho soup. Just wanted something for the diaghter but they were basically like small soup 5 dollars. <br><br>And lastly no easy way to get to	1
A-maz-zing! Attentive staff, feel-good music &amp; delicious food! <br><br>We ordered one of everything on the food menu! The brisket sandwich is delectable! The fries are yummy &amp; ohh too cute inside the mini frying basket! <br><br>I love the Victorian sofas &amp; chairs, elegant and cozy decor!<br>If you haven&#39;t been here yet.. get off your ass &amp; go! Do it.	1
After craving a pastrami sandwich all day, I made the drive over to Canters. The Canters Fairfax signature sandwich, pastrami & corned beef stacked high on rye, was everything I wanted. It wasn't quite a heaping behemoth you'd find at Carnegie Deli, but just as delicious. Don't come here if you are planning to eat a salad, but if you want a savory deli sandwich chased with a slice of strawberry cheesecake, Canters gets it right.	1
I had bread to go.Pecan Raisin! Was recommended, and it was really good! Even better when you toast it slightly and eat it with some jam. =DThey also have this Cherry Tart or something like that, and it is realllyyyyyy good. Only if it was a little closer to home, I'd be a regular!	1
This is a solid four stars for friendly staff, delicious authentic tapas, and good prices. <br><br>I think that this place has been highly under-rated on yelp. It seems to me that unsatisfied yelpers are probably the result of poor ordering. Don&#39;t go to a restaurant known for tapas and plan to order a fish entree. <br><br>The three items I had tonight were excellent: garbanzos, tortilla de chorizo, and a bocadillo with Jamon Serrano and a hefty serving of manchego. The restaurant was also packed with spaniards- always a good sign.	1
Attitude alert--especially for gluten/dairy free. I cannot eat gluten or dairy and yes I realize that makes me a pain in the ass for many, but when I dine out I am always able to pick my way thru a menu and find something satisfying. Animal is the most rigidified restaurant I&#39;ve ever encountered. They were completely unwilling to leave a garnish of fried shallots (rolled in flour) off my meal. Mind you, that&#39;s a GARNISH, nothing that&#39;s already mixed in or part of a sauce. And this was the ONLY item on the entire menu that I could eat. Everything else has wheat and/or dairy. I can understand a chef wanting to maintain the integrity of a recipe, but the attitude here is they would rather you leave than to have to alter a dish in any way. <br><br>Griping aside, the hamachi tostada that I ordered was delightful--even tho I had to pick the fried shallots out of the cabbage mixture that crowned the hamachi and move them to the side. My friend ordered quail and it was sublime. These folks know what they&#39;re doing, in terms of food quality, creativity, and preparation. <br><br>Nonetheless, I won&#39;t return because the message I got was : &#34;Don&#39;t bother us with your special needs--we&#39;re way too cool.&#34; Places that take themselves so seriously, to the point where they are more important than the customer, become very boring. Really, I wasn&#39;t asking for that much--just leave the freakin&#39; shallots off the dish...	0
If you are a foodie and like tapas style you will love this place. I thought the ambiance was a little lacking for a wannabe date night spot but the food is outstanding for the area.	1
Great lunch place, friendly service, and awesome coffee	1
Great Happy Hour! Friendly bartenders, great beer selection. Could use a little more character, decor wise but honestly it&#39;s nice to at least see a clean bar in Wynwood, one where I&#39;m not afraid to use the bathroom. The music is always good here!	1
Delicious! I can't wait to take advantage of the fact this place Is open 24 hours. Very good and fresh food.	1
Not happy. They won&#39;t let a party over 10 sit together. They separate the tables and what&#39;s the fun of going out with people to have that happen? Then, bc you&#39;re a group they force you to order the same appetizers and share. The regular menu you&#39;d get an app with every entree.<br><br>You cannot share without a $10 fee<br><br>You cannot only order an appetizer<br><br>The appetizers were better than the entrees. Small portionsa and all around not worth it. Entree start at $18.99. <br><br>It was nice they provided blankets on the windy, chilly night the heaters were not providing much heat at all. No one in my large party was impressed and I&#39;d never return.	0
I dragged my boyfriend here because of all the great yelp reviews and we were really disappointed. I really don&#39;t understand the hype around this place... Yeah, the galbi jjim was good but it definitely was not worth the money and it was tiny! We also ordered the mackerel cause the waitress recommended it and it was not what we expected and it was just ok. <br><br>Overpriced. You can find better authentic korean food in LA.	0
Used them for a corporate lunch in Coconut Grove and couldn&#39;t have had a better experience. They were on time and the food was amazing. Everyone in the meeting was very impressed with the quality of lunch. I would use them again in a heartbeat!	1
I was happily taken to Sardine for brunch today (Saturday) in which I was in rare form after a night out. We sat out on the pleasant terrace by the lake and it felt like a relaxed, welcoming place even though I couldn't bear to take off my sunglasses.	0
Any chance I get to eat here I come. The pancakes are my favorite! The only downside is the line to get in is always so long! Once you&#39;re seated the food comes out quick though. Overall, it&#39;s always a good experience.	1
I walk in. I order. 2 muffins and a small tea. I show the guy my 10% off Yelp check-in. &#34;I don&#39;t know how to do that so I&#39;ll just give you back 10% in cash,&#34; he says. No prob bob. I tell him to just put the 10% in the tip jar. He then says to me, &#34;let me ask you something. How come only Asians use the 10% off Yelp check in?&#34; I don&#39;t know, dude, how come you lump all Asians together and assume the worst of us? He himself was Asian, by the way. Also, why offer something only to resent it when people accept the offer? (And tip you with it, no less. Not a word of thanks about that.) Really rubbed me the wrong way. I won&#39;t be returning here. Try a little self-love, bro. Just because we&#39;re both Asian (huge continent btw buddy) doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m anything like you. Weirdest vibe ever. Auf Nimmerwiedersehen.	0
Nice ambience, attentive staff. Festive atmosphere. Too bad the food was so wretched. Maybe it&#39;s because we arrived at the tail end of brunch, around 4 pm? I don&#39;t know. My salad was limp and lifeless, and my wife juevos ranchero sans salsa, needed a post-mortem. If you go, stick with bottled beer and the raw bar. I think that would have been a better bet.	0
Heard about this place from a friend so I decided to try it out. It's a little pricey for the food you get, but it was good. You are really paying for the show that's put on for every entree. The tables are to small for what is brought to you. I must say it was fun. I'd go back for a birthday or something like that. I certainly wouldn't go for a Friday night dinner out, but if it's your first time I would defiantly check it out. Lobster Mac and cheese was really good.	1
This place was a 4 star on food and value, but lost points in other key areas:Service - Although she was prompt, she was not friendly, did not smile, and walked up to the table chewing food twice.In addition, I bit down on a staple in my tender greens, most likely from the vegetable's packaging. If I had swallowed it, I could have seriously jacked up my insides.I wish I could give a better rating because the food was very tasty, the tea was perfect and to get lunch specials for only $4.60 is insanity!	0
I have been a loyal customer of the Original Pantry since 1972. That's 40 years, folks! Having said that, I believe my unbiased opinion has value when it comes to an honest review of this establishment. I will admit I haven't eaten there in a long time (a few years) since I don't get up that way much anymore. However, I ate there twice in the last month alone. The first visit was absolutely terrible. I decided to get the "Hamburger Steak", as it was always one of my favorites. I would always drench it in the Original Pantry Steak Sauce. After noticing there were no bottles of this outstanding steak sauce on the table, I asked the waitress (yes, that's right "waitress" as in female, something they also never had before) for a bottle. I was told they didn't carry it anymore, as it was too expensive to supply. After years of serving this traditional steak sauce, he has eliminated it from the tables! This was a great disappointment as I would always buy two bottles to go when I left. A couple of weeks later I decided to give it another try, since I had never had a bad meal there before. The second (and my last) time was a disaster. I can honestly say I have patronized this place in excess of 500 times over the course of the years. I have had nearly everything on the menu numerous times. My favorites have changed over the years as well. Not because of any new taste I may have acquired, but because they changed the recipe of a particular dish or how they prepared it. Here's where my opinion comes in. The changes that current owner Richard Riordan have implemented since he acquired this establishment have most definitely not been for the better. The quality of the food has plummeted downward, while the prices have sky rocketed upwards. Sadly, no longer was this a place that served up quality comfort-food fare in large quantities at affordable prices. This establishment was founded in 1924. Founder Dewy Logan carried this business through the great depression, giving people quality food and value for their hard earned money. Unlike Richard Riordan, Dewey was more concerned with the people of his community, serving up quality food and value in those economically depressed times, rather than squeezing the last dollar out of his patrons for substandard food. Rather than maintain the once legendary tradition, Richard Riordan has done the exact opposite of what founder Dewey Logan believed in. Too keep prices reasonable while maintaining high quality food standards consistent of yesteryear. Mr. Riordan has cut so many corners the negative changes cannot be overlooked or go unnoticed. It's absurdly evident. Another not so clever trick was his change of dishware. All plates and bowls have been changed to a smaller size in order to give the illusion you are getting the same quantity as always, while the portions have shrunk dramatically. The quality of the food is terrible, often over cooked and tough. The standards appear to have dropped dramatically. I had the "Short Ribs" last Saturday evening on my second return visit. The meat was so tough a dinner steak knife struggled to cut through it. In prior years, the meat literally fell off the bone. In addition , there was an equal amount of pure fat as there was lean meat. An inferior cut of meat and absolutely unacceptable.There is very little left that resembles the long standing traditions of what the Original Pantry was all about and known for. I will point out one positive mention though. Their famous Cole Slaw is still a winner. However, the overall experience was an incredible disappointment and not worth the Cole Slaw alone! My recommendation would be to save your money and stay away from this place regardless of what you remember about it. Those memories no longer exist. There are far too many other places in Los Angeles that serve up quality food fare at reasonable prices. I don't mind paying a little more for a good meal but that is not the case here. I know for one I WILL NOT BE BACK! You've been WARNED! Don't say I didn't tell you so.	0
My review is for breakfast only:	1
Fish tacos! Great spot to sit down and eat a quick bite or grab something on the go, they&#39;re fast and always get my order right. I always get the fish tacos and a margarita, soooo good. Makes me a happy person coming to calle :)	1
Very busy place but we can&#39;t figure out why. We had to wait for about an hour. We were seated upstairs which was nice but it went down hill from there. Food was not good at all. Tonight we drove by there to go to La Comida (another let down), and they were packed. Unbelievable!	0
Ordered a couple of sandwiches during a questionable weather period. Had to call twice, the food arrived 1.15 hr later, usually it&#39;s under 30 min, I should mention that I live 2 blocks away, not even.<br>There were a number of items missing in the order, I decided to call and ask, the reply was, among other things &#34;you were not even charged for those items&#34;. (Clearly that was my concern)<br><br>So the service was very slow and rude, I will be ordering elsewhere.	0
Worst service ever. How did this place ever get 4 stars? Really?<br><br>When we first get to our table, I see a server hanging out along the wall by the server&#39;s station and she&#39;s BITING her nails. Health department, where you at? I was hoping and praying that this lady was NOT our server, but as luck would have it, she was indeed our server. Completely unsanitary. Strike ONE.<br><br>When the food comes out, almost everything we ordered is served room-temperature or colder. The only thing that is hot is the paella. So when we tell our server that the Lamb Stew was cold, she took it from us without another look and walked away. 2 minutes later, she brings it back microwaved. Just drops it on the table without a word or an apology. Cold food? Strike TWO.<br><br>The entire meal, our server was not present, did not once ask us how the food was, and was rude as hell. She was so incredibly terrible. And lazy. So when it came time to check out and we couldnt get our server to take our credit card, we told the MANAGER or at least this guy wearing a gray shirt who told us he was the manager, about the horrible service we had. And all he did was grab the check from us, gave it to our horrible server, and that lady ended up closing us out and that was that. No apology from the server, or the manager. Bad service from all staff? STRIKE THREE.<br><br>Food itself is just ok. The Lamb Stew smelled like sweat. The skirt steak was good. Paella was overcooked and mushy. The Cuban Sandwich was super dry. Like desert dry.<br><br>I do not recommend this restaurant. Go elsewhere. Save yourself the headache of bad service with average food.	0
Horrendous customer service and only average food. My order was ninety minutes late and I got hung up on--twice! Just go to New Tsing Tao on West Portal.	0
My girlfriends and I had my bachelorette dinner at Lucia and it was a great experience. The food was amazing, so was the service and the Prosecco we ordered for our drinks. It was a great choice for both food and ambiance. At some point I found it a little noisy but I think we contributed significantly :) Will definitely return again.	1
Beware this more upscale Mexican restaurant is for those who are 21+ years or older !! don't get me wrong their alcoholic drinks are to die for and their menu is fabulous !! It is a restaurant that attracts people to the downtown area !!	1
OMG Yum! Stopped in while thrifting in Silverlake and so glad we did. Super basic but cute setup; chalkboard menu and beers on draft. Ordered the carne asada nachos, a few tacos and a couple of beers. Everything we ate, including the sauces, was exceptionally good. (I'm still having dreams about the nachos).If I were you, I'd make a special trip to pop in for lunch. **If in doubt when ordering, get the barbacoa tacos. Amazing.	1
Referred by a friend and not disappointed! Great food and service.	1
I was there last night, they re designed the patio and it is really cute now. I really like the food but especially the corn flakes schnitzel. For the starters mix sausages are perfect. And I drank the best beer with das boot. Was a great night, highly suggested	1
Been to Playa Provisions twice (once for lunch, once for dinner)--both times the food has been great, but the service is rather lackluster. The host and hostess have been friendly and welcoming on both occasions, but the waiter and waitress were both disinterested and absent. They need to step it up. That being said, the food is great and there is valet!	1
Open 24 hours! super awesome<br><br>I think I would come here alot if I live in the area<br><br>their oxtail soup was delicious and cheap! I think it was around $5 dollars. <br><br>Their kimchi and raddish sides were fresh and delicious too!	1
Overall i think the place had to much hype about it.<br><br>The food tasted like quickly prepared diner food/borderline cafeteria food to me. The sides were super bland and the main courses we ordered didn&#39;t fall too far from that tree either.<br><br>Its cool that it has plenty of history and such behind it, but the food was really off for me.	0
Delicious but for the price the portions could have produced more leftovers.	1
This was my first time here with my girlfriend.  It was awesome.  The food was great and the service was impeccable.	1
I can't understand why there were people waiting to eat at this place. Food was mediocre. Service was awful. No one on the staff was the least bit pleasant. Everyone acted like they were in a hurry to do something but had no time to provide any customer service. Like they were doing us a favor by waiting on us. I would never go back and can't recommend this place.	0
Pricey? Yes, but everything I have ordered has been worth the price. Delicious. Make sure you get a black and white cookie from the bakery on your way out!	1
Great place, try the lamb rolls and the grilled octopus. Good service too. We are definitely coming back and trying other plates. Good place for a date.	1
THE spot for LA&#39;s best burger + pie combo. You can&#39;t get much simpler than this place, which only has counter seating and about 5 things on the menu. Its a classic burger joint. I like to imagine that Richie Cunningham and the Fonze would have eaten here if they lived in Cali..and if they were real people. This place should win the Nobel Prize for banana cream pie. Its spectacular. I&#39;ve also heard a rumor that this was the location of James Dean&#39;s last meal. Can anyone confirm that?	1
A good rainy Seattle day will be just perfect if you add a warm market chowder in a bread bowl. You can't go wrong with it!	1
After seeing all of the hype this place has received, I took the chance to visit Bun Mee during the Fillmore Jazz Festival. It was surprisingly uncrowded and I was able to get a seat without waiting. Unfortunately, they were running a limited menu that day with only three or four sandwiches available. I got something not, apparently, on the usual menu - I think it was a lemon seasoned pork. The seasonings were a nice twist and quite flavorful. Disappointingly, the sandwiches that day had been premade and were sitting in the back; I received mine about 30 seconds after I ordered it. Sadly, this had a dramatic effect on the bun.A further disappointment came when I asked the woman at the register for a glass of water. She denied my request, and offered to sell me a bottle. Looking around the restaurant, I noted several other patrons with pint glasses filled with tap water. One day I may return to explore the full menu that is not pre-prepared, but I will not go out of my way for it.	0
Was very excited to try but super disappointed !! Service was horrible food was ok . The interior was beautifully decorated that was worth the visit ! Went in before a show and had to track our server down just to get out of there!!! Same with drinks and food waited a loooong time for everything !!!	0
Without a doubt the best rooftop and views in DTLA.The food continues to improve and the drinks are always good.My recommendation is to come on a weekday when it isn't so busy; otherwise, you'll spend a lot of time waiting in line. That's never fun.	1
We had our wedding cake catered by La Brioche and couldn't have been happier. The design was exactly what we had discussed, and they managed to perfectly match a tiny color sample I had given them. More than that, the flavor of the cake was amazing. We had lemon poppy seed with a lemon curd filling and vanilla buttercream. The lemon was just tart enough, and the buttercream was smooth, lightly flavored, and not overly sweet. The cake itself was perfectly moist; not soggy or gummy, but not dry. The staff were great to work with in the planning process, and they delivered an excellent product for a reasonable price.	0
Super cool space, love the decor and they have some pretty awesome drinks as well. Must try the octopus tacos!	1
Worst experience ever, we visited this place since we watched an episode from Guy Fieri on the Food Network.<br>Food is horrible and overpriced, $9.00 for conch fritters each piece was the size of a quarter, and the famous minuta was dark meat less than 0.5cm thick more breading than fish, tasted fishy and greasy.<br>Cup of soup it was only rice and consome not even a piece of fish or carrot or anything.<br>McDonalds Filet of Fish is way better quality than theirs.	0
This place is out of this world.	1
The dal. The dal. The dal.	1
I was craving for samgaetang for awhile and could not find any good place near Long Beach on yelp. After reading all the reviews on Yelp, I decided to give Mountain cafe a try. Mountain cafe is indeed a hole in the wall type of place. It's small inside and most of space were used as a kitchen. Waitress and cooks are all middle-aged Korean women. It reminded me of home cooking. Waitress was very friendly even though we spoke no Korean. I ordered samgaetang and was surprised with the portion. The baby chicken was served in a big boiling bowl. The soup was light and I get to season it myself. It's my first time to try samgaetang. I didn't know what to expect. I admit the soup was not as flavorful as I imagined it. But it was not bad either. Hubby ordered kimchee stew. He loved it. There were some glass noodles and rice cakes in the stew. I liked his too. But what impressed us the most were the side dishes. The marinated daikons were crunch. Homemade kimchee's the best I ever had. If I live/work close by, this would be my No. 1 comfort food choice!	1
The sugar brioche the croissants the rhubarb strawberry tarts...	1
I really wanted to like this place. The decor is cute, and the menu seemed like they put a lot of thought in it. The cornbread was very yummy...and I am not much of a cornbread person, so maybe I am not qualified to judge. My husband, though is southern and really went to town on it. I ordered the polenta with baked eggs. Okay, full disclosure, I don&#39;t like my eggs undercooked. I like them with a well cooked yolk. That said I can eat them with the yolk a little runny like most restaurants serve them at brunch. I don&#39;t LOVE them that way, but I will eat them that way from time to time. I forgot to ask that the eggs be well cooked but since I can deal with medium cooked eggs I didn&#39;t bother to change the order with the waitress - I fully expected them to have runny yolks. But these eggs were beyond runny. The egg was so undercooked white part was still clear and gelatinous on top and it smelled like a raw egg. It takes a lot to turn my stomach but that certainly did. The blood orange mimosa was just alright. It felt like it was trying too hard - if a mimosa can try too hard- I would have expected it to taste a little more blood-orangey. My husband ordered the corned beef hash. I had a nibble and it was good. I will say the lady next to me was enjoying her mean tremendously. She ordered two entrees and seemed to enjoy them both. At least she finished them both - but that may be because she was pregnant. It&#39;s not a fun brunch place. It&#39;s cute and quiet. Its for civilized brunchers so not really my scene as a brunch place. I would go there if my parents are in town, but not with my friends for raucous afternoon fun.	0
Great restaurant! We (group of 4) went on a Friday evening but didn't have reservations. None were available until Saturday,but were informed the day before if we got there by 7, we'd most likely get seated. We got seated,but had to wait 2 hours! We didn't have a problem because we were enjoying the awesome view and great drinks! I had a couple Weihenstephaners and French Maids (cognac). Both were great! We had the surf and turf skewers. It comes with four and were quite tasty. For dinner I had the steak frites with truffle fries! DAMN, I could eat those fries for dinner without the meat! Food was delicious! I would suggest to make reservations or do as we did and get there by 7 and enjoy the view and drinks! If you want to go upstairs, you might have to wait. When we left around 12, they asked if we were done. It's like, 3 people walk out, 3 people go in! Didn't realize, but there's another line outside to actually get into the building. So get there early or get reservations!We will definitely return WITH reservations!	1
This is a review for the bar only.<br><br>There&#39;s a line to get upstairs. I was in a trio of me and my girlfriends so after the lady at the front door confirmed that we were only a group of 3 girls, she pulled us out of line with these 2 other girls and let us in, saving the 10-20 minute wait.<br><br>I would say the average age in the crowd was 32. <br><br>There&#39;s another line to get to the very top bar above the restaurant bar level. My friend wanted to throw up right when we made it to the front of this line so my other friend took her and I stayed in line. I told the security man at the front what happened and he was nice enough to let them resume first in line when they came back. <br><br>This place is classy. It&#39;s not a club. You go here to talk.	1
I love these rice balls!! <br><br>I just wanna stuff my mouth with them all of the time.<br><br>This is the second official location of Sunny Blue; the original being in Santa Monica. This location definitely has more room with a cute wooden communal table that could sit roughly ten or so. Complimentary barley tea and water are offered and parking consists of metered (free on Sunday&#39;s). <br><br>Now let&#39;s move on to the omusubi aka rice ball aka onigiri. I have to say this location is just as yummy as the original. I get easily stuffed just eating three or four of them personally. There&#39;s a variety to choose from including meat, seafood, and a fair amount of vegan. I love them all. My personal favorites consist of the spicy salmon (not spicy), chicken curry, and the ume (plum). I also like the miso mushroom. You can also substitute white rice for brown for an additional fee. <br><br>Overall, I am happy that this location is more convenient for us Los Angelenos on the East side.	1
We wanted to eat in the MGM before seeing Ka. We were looking for someplace nice, with good food, but but not too expensive.  A couple places we called were already booked up for the time we needed. We were able to get a table in Crush, but weren't really sure what to expect. Well,  we couldn't have been more pleased!  It's beautifully decorated, not noisy or smokey, and from our table we  couldn't even tell we were in a casino. The service was good, nothing to complain about, but nothing remarkable. The food, though, was amazing!  It is mostly small plates, but you may order them dinner sized. We shared several items. The mini angus burgers are about the best any of us have ever had!  They have blue cheese crumbles and carmelized onions and are incredible!  We also had a mushroom pizza, which was delicious. We got the 1/2 chicken, which was very good, but more closely resembled a Cornish game hen in size.  (I guess we should have &quot;up sized&quot; it).  All the food was wonderful. The prices are quite reasonable for terrific food in a lovely atmosphere. It was a great dining experience.  I highly recommend it and we will be back.	1
Of my 1009 reviews, only 12 have been 1-star. Basically, it takes a lot to annoy me enough to give 1-star.<br><br>If your job is seating a dining room, you should know the wait time for walk-ins on the tip of your tongue. Here&#39;s what a host or hostess should NOT do when someone approaches your station.<br><br>Me: How long for two?<br>Hostess: Do you have reservations?<br>Me: No.<br>Hostess: Okay, let me seat these people first.<br>Me: Okay.<br><br>Because she didn&#39;t answer my easy question, I&#39;m thinking that they have seating available, but she has a few things to do with guests who made reservations. As a walk-in, I can accept lower priority, so I patiently wait.<br><br>The hostess then returns to seat someone who came in after us, but was joining a party that was already there. The hostess then returns to work on the reservation system. The hostess then wanders to look around the dining area and pour some drinks. The hostess returns to press more buttons on the reservation system. The hostess answers the phone as she presses more buttons on the reservation system. I see people at the bar pay their tab. Five to ten minutes have passed and hostess gets back to us and says &#34;It&#39;ll be about thirty minutes.&#34;<br><br>What?!?! I waited because I thought she had seating eminently available. She made me wait to say I had to wait some more? She clearly didn&#39;t want to deal with us. If her goal was to make us feel unwanted, then she 100% succeeded along with creating an awful start to dinner.<br><br>Don&#39;t come here without a reservation, because you might not be treated well. Oh wait, that might not be true. It looks some Yelpers wrote on 1/17/15 that they had reservations and were still terribly treated by a condescending hostess. Sound familiar?	0
Cute little place. If I'm here with a friend we usually sit at the window and eat indian style. As in, pillows, low table and legs crossed. I love that little seating area. It feels so private and intimate. The food here is exceptional. I've had the thai salad, and that was really flavorful and filling. Their breakfast is also delicious. My favorite item off their menu is the bossanova waffle. Try it! It's really good. I used to really like their red velvet cupcakes as well but, the last time I went there (about a month ago) it was absolutely inedible. We had to take it back, it was really gross. But I will forgive that incident and perhaps it was just a fluke. I am a little scared to order it again now though. The servers are usually friendly. We got a weird old guy last time. He seemed like he hated his life. He was so out of place. I hope he doesn't last. The bathrooms are ok. Not dirty but not clean either. There is parking on the street (if you can find it) and also a parking lot where you have to pay by meter.	1
Wonderful food, service and ambiance. We always make sure to stop here when we're in Vegas. Nice quiet place to have a evening of conversation or romance, away from the sounds of the casino. Staff has always been very friendly. Enjoy the salads &amp; banana flame that are prepared at your table. Highly recommend it.	1
It's terrible, stay away!!	1
Local favorite food truck Arepa Lady moves into a physical location. A story made in Brooklyn, Queens edition, so the target audience is not predominantly young white hipsters.<br><br>I&#39;d had arepas before visiting the Lady but I wasn&#39;t not used to the degree of choice on offer here with four different styles. I&#39;m still not since the arepas here are huge and I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t try to order two.<br><br>The chocolo con carne asada ($8) and the array of sauces (which are unlabeled but the staff helpfully explained) was a delicious mix of savory and slightly sweet with the cornmeal itself. One is plenty; maybe share an appetizer or something else but unless you&#39;re starving after a workout that&#39;s going to be enough.<br><br>Juices ($4) are available with water or milk. The mango with milk (which let&#39;s be honest and call it a mango milkshake) was deliciously thick and creamy and seemed to last longer than I expected and probably longer than was healthy.<br><br>The one thing Arepa Lady does not have much of is space. I ventured here alone around dinnertime on a Saturday and I was the last to sit before needing to wait (and only because of my party size.) I&#39;d like to be able to return here... so, on second thought, maybe it&#39;s not so good. Ignore this review. Please?	1
I was expecting a normal bar burger but to my surprise it was really juicy and very tasty,...the fries are the bomb....<br><br>I will be returning very soon	1
Felt like I walked into old school Brooklyn and we loved every bite of it. The owner was sincere and told it how it was; specials and all. Can&#39;t find that charm much anymore from a guy doing it all. We loved all the food that was made and served for us. Chicken parms, fresh made linguine in oil and garlic, huge plate of meatballs and fresh mozzarella with tomato. The desserts were amazing..and the bill...was very well priced as we rolled out of this wonderful restaurant. Thanks Brian for a great dinner with some awesome live music to go with it as well!	1
Im sorry but this is so far the worst service i had in a colombian restaurant, the food is a 6, because the meat had half a pound of salt and the rice none, the chicharron was cold and hard, and i went to buy some food and the bakery side and they said they will add the balance to my check, when i received my check they had already charge me 15% tip , when it was just me my wife and my 2 kids i wouldnt mind paying the tip but when your server is impossible to find is just not riight read your bill before you leave really worst experience ever	0
Just ate my first manly burger and sweet potato French fries from umami burger.... YUMMY!!! Eric... 5stars just for you and your stellar service!! You are lovely! I'm definitely coming back! ... Ps, loved your space... Super cozy comfy!	1
Hot dogs are ok<br><br>Nothing special with their sauces <br><br>The place is uncomfortable to eat and they are not clean<br>Bathroom had piss all over and if you try to wash your hand their you&#39;ll leave there with Ebola <br><br>Parking is a head ache as their is literally 6 spots only <br><br>They do not accept credit card only cash <br><br>Fries with cheese are very basic... Same cheese you get anywhere <br><br>Their was no ice because they said it was raining.... Rain melted their ice??<br><br>Comeback? No I won&#39;t be back as it&#39;s not a healthy place	0
I loved the idea of all local food and tried this place- I was greatly disappointed by the bland food and less than great service. Next time I will go elsewhere	0
I came here yesterday for a friend's bday dinner. Good things : *Food was good. I had the hangar steak. Cooked to my liking of medium rare and it was actually medium rare unlike other places. It had this tasty sauce on it......forgot what it was called. Other ppl ordered the mac n cheese which was better than expected. I read earlier on yelp how it was bomb but ppl were skeptical. It turned out better than expected for what it was..mac n cheese..haha. *Prices for food were reasonable. My steak was less than $20. It was about a 12 oz hangar steak w/ sum sides. Pretty bomb steak for less than $20.*MOJITO...damn good mojito...all fresh mint leaves....took a while to make...good stuff*Service was attentive and water was filled up rather quick. Waitresses actually knew what they were doing even though we had a big party. *Surprised how the laker game was on....since it seemed more like a date spot.......i was glad to see the lakers blow out the jazz..niceeeeOther things :*The place is more of a date spot...so the lights were really dim...hard to see the menu....damn*The seating area of the table was pretty crammed. Each table had a table leg at the end of each corner ....old school style...so the seats were really close together. At least i didn't sit at the edge...but still crammed. *Bigass bday cake....w/ a sparkler like at clubs when ppl order a bottle of cris or sumshit...it was funny cuz the cake was fake...it was a hugeeee cake...*Place is pretty packed and busy that there is a line for the bathroom....this ain't no lounge or club...wtf! haha	1
I love India Bistro. I am a vegetarian and there are a lot of great options. The Daal and the Shahi Paneer are really good. Also the service is awesome.	1
Our server, Dimitri, was so knowledgeable not only about the food preparation, but where the food originated from and beer and wine pairings. He also had a very comfortable way about him and made us feel right at home. Lucien, the bartender, was an expert at drinks and service. Everything was perfect for my husband's birthday. Thank you!	0
A 20 min. wait for an almond milk latte. *sigh* While this place makes amazing coffee, it&#39;s not worth the wait. The chick at the cashier messed up the 3 orders before me and then then messed up mine even though I read it back to her twice. I will take my business down the street where hipsters don&#39;t flock for artisan coffee that they soak in magical fairy dust for 20 mins. Prior to serving.	0
Had my 28th bday get together here along with other events. I absolutely love this place. If you love a stunning view of LA's most beautiful sky scrapers, this is your place. The drinks are great. The food is ok.. very small menu.	1
I went with my boyfriend.. Only a couple of tables were taken.. Waited for almost ten mins to get service. the waiters were just walking around. One of them passed by us attended every table except us. Got tired of waiting so we left to eat across the street!	0
They definitely don&#39;t skimp. Tacos are full and super tasty. I wanna eat like 20 of these into sickness. That combined with insanely friendly service will keep me coming back!	1
We came here for our first meal after moving to town and had an amazing experience! Great service, the chef came out to check on us! Romantic ambiance & really good food. We had the lamb sliders and fries --- they were delicious! Great beer selection and cider too but their specialty is infused liquors and unique cocktails! Thanks for welcoming us to town, we will be back!	0
My son bought a few pounds of lechon.. And boy I was highly disappointed. The lechon was very soggy (not crispy at all) drenched in oil.(its almost like a soup of oil) It did not taste or look like lechon at all. It looked like it was left over pulled pork. They also included the trimmings of the herbs that they use to make lechon in to the mix. Which is not cool at all. Your paying for the lechon not the herb trimmings (which they manage to hide underneath the meat. What a rip off!	0
I have finally experienced AJ BOMBERS!!!! And here is what I have to say... It is DELICIOUS. Now let's get a little past the bombs dropping peanuts, yes its funny and cool and all but really not what the place is all about. Their food is pretty freakin' good if ya ask me and the atmosphere is something to marvel at. Writing on the wall, industrial type decor, and some cool artwork in some places. I came here a couple of times to really get the sense of the place and here is my review in full (might seem a bit short but there is a reason for that). The happy hour prices are pretty awesome and the prices for food is pretty average. The people that work here though are awesome and really make you feel welcome.	0
the burgers are good. but not THE best. <br><br>but i&#39;d give this place 5 stars just for their banana creme pie!<br>it&#39;s the best ever.<br><br>i think the creme pies are what they are known for. YUM.	1
You get what you paid for.<br><br>I seriously don&#39;t understand why this place has 5 starts. They use the wrong bread, and it&#39;s not toasted. They use the cheap meats, or if there&#39;s any meat at all. My pork belly bahn mi was all fat with no meat. My grilled pork bahn mi had a couple piece of dry and flavorless meat. And it took them 15 minutes to make the 2 sandwiches.<br><br>It&#39;s a great concept, but lacks quality. <br><br>We left feeling ripped off and disgusted.	0
Roy Choi's 2nd restaurant located in The Line. It's located on the second floor by the pool. You can't miss it cause it's a greenhouse! We came here for breakfast and already I felt I would love this place. What better way to start the day than to eat breakfast in a greenhouse on a gorgeous sunny day. Love the random mix-up of styles of chairs, tables, and dinnerware. It definitely gave off a home-y, casual vibe. While waiting for our food, I checked out the bar and whoever chose their alcohol selection has great taste in dark liquor. Some names that caught my eye: Aberlour, Balvenie, Laphroaig, Glenlivet, Yamazaki, and Michter's. Amazing selection for scotch and bourbon drinkers. The food came and it looked amazing. For how much our dishes (Sourdough breakfast sandwich - $12 and Spam, eggs, and rice - $10), the portions were pretty big and filling. The first thing I noticed about the Spam and Eggs looked like a disassembled spam musubi. The spam had seaweed pieces garnishing them and the rice had sesame seeds and the eggs were garnished with scallions. Definitely felt like a breakfast I would have had from my grandma in Hawaii. The sourdough breakfast sandwich was on point. I ate half and was full. The sourdough was perfectly toasted and buttered and the perfectly crisp bacon was delicious with the egg and cheese. If you're looking for a casual breakfast spot with a great vibe or just want to start your day feeling relaxed, then come grab some breakfast at Commissary.	1
It&#39;s a nice place on the corner along Pico Blvd. Behind this place is all residential, so street parking is an option. Watch out for certain days from 12- 3 PM when it&#39;s street cleaning. <br><br>I wanted to try their cold brew, but sadly they were all out. I resorted for an Iced Americano. It&#39;s lighter than how I usually drink it. It had a pleasant fragrance. They had some great selection of pastry as well. It seems like a good place for meeting since it wasn&#39;t so loud. I would love to come back here for brunch or lunch.	1
I went here for dinner - as a guy who has had a lot of middle estern food in his life - I gotta say the food was really good - especially the Kefteh kabob. The prices are a bit expensive, and there is only one waiter (but that worked fine for us as there weren't that many people there) With that said, it is good food and good atmosphere/decor. Would go here again. If they changed their prices a bit, It would attract a lot more customers.	0
This place is in the area, and I really wanted to support it... but it&#39;s kind of terrible. This place gives vegan food a bad name. (I&#39;m not vegan, but I&#39;ve dabbled in vegan cooking and eaten at other vegan restaurants before.)<br><br>I had a latte and a crepe here. The coffee was terrible. Pretty tasteless and whatever milk they used totally overpowered the taste of the espresso. Yuck. The crepe was okay. The filling was tasty (berries and some sort of whipped cream) but nothing special. However, the crepe itself was not very thin or crispy--too much batter.<br><br>I mostly came here to get some work done since there&#39;s free wifi that works fairly well. The place is bright, and it never got super loud, so if you don&#39;t mind background noise, this is an okay place to do some light work. There is music playing in the background, but it was all music I normally listen to, so it was fine (Florence and the Machine, Feist, etc.) However, the cafe isn&#39;t that large, and so the tables are all rather small. If you need to spread your things out, this isn&#39;t really the place to go.	0
Reserved a table through Yelp and it was ready right when I arrived on a Sunday afternoon for brunch. Waiter was super nice and quick to bring everything. Manager walking around to make sure everything was ok. He was very friendly as well. Had the unlimited mimosas (great and inexpensive!!!) and loved my grilled cheese. View of HW, sunshine, mimosa brunch... what more can you ask for??? Waited a while to write a review because, well, I don&#39;t want this place to start getting too crowded ;-)	1
I really wish I could give this place more stars.It's super close to home, it offers healthy food that isn't overly granola-fied (I can make up words!), and it's super adorable! That being said, the service SUCKS. Not in that "I'm slightly annoyed" way, but in that "WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON HERE?!" way. The first time I came to Bloom, I figured that with the weekend rush these things happen and sometimes you regrettably get bad service. However yesterday morning I took my cousin here for brunch and it was terrible. There were open tables, but it was really confusing about where we were supposed to stand to try to get a table. Then we waited 20 minutes for menus. Then our food came out cold. Our coffees left empty for long stretches of time. Our check took over 30 minutes.Luckily my cousin and I had a lot to talk about.Definitely not worth the trouble. Next time I'll try the Little Owl across the street.	0
Definitely get there early to grab a seat. Outside seating is the best, but inside is great too. Had the Turkey Avocado Wrap, which was A LOT, so I couldn&#39;t finish it but soooo wanted to. Also tried their Strawberry-Banana Frappe - which was very tasty. Our waiter (forgot to remember his name) was so awesome and I will definitely hit this place up when I go back!	1
Very good hotel restaurant. The Tasting menu with wine pairing is very reasonable with good choices.	1
first time here and I&#39;m in a food coma...big portions, reasonable price, can&#39;t wait to come back	1
The fries are good, and so is the spiced house ketchup. From there, it goes downhill. From the salads to the BBQ, it's all meat and no finesse. The decor is lacking, but the service is really friendly and, apparently, the chocolate malt is good. Why the pork isn't better at a place called the Oinkster is hard to imagine though. Dry crumbly garbage.	0
Just a bunch of fried stuff, I must of tried the wrong things.	0
The last 2 times they missed up our reservation.  Thankfully, they've added Open Table!	1
Just finished eating here and loved it. Great happy hour and and atmosphere.	1
Go there and sit outside, start by ordering french fries with gorgonzola cheese sauce. We almost always go there when friends come from outside the LA area.	1
The food is very good and well priced. I&#39;ve tried most of the plates and have been pleasantly surprised by most. The rices are good and the fishes as well. Must get the croquetas and stuffed bacalao peppers as starters! Nice ambiance and newly renovated. Good date place.	1
I loved it.<br>Two thumb up !<br>I definitely want to come back again.<br>I strongly recommend this place as the best &#34;pho&#34; in K TOWN.	1
Best biscuits I have had since I moved from Texas! Make sure to eat them with honey!!	1
love the noodle soups!	1
The Mint Lemonade was interesting, very sharp and minty. I couldn&#39;t finish it.<br><br>The chicken teriyaki plate was horrendous. The chicken was bite sized and tiny. The sushi roll was made of salmon, but the salmon was gummy and warm. Ugh. Worst way to eat any raw fish.<br><br>The only highlight was the cookie with cream. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be back.	0
I love that this great cafe is just a few blocks from home. And, the crepes and coffee are amazing. I haven&#39;t had a crepe that I didn&#39;t like. The owners are really lovely people, too, with great service. I highly recommend you check this place out, if you&#39;re in the neighborhood.	1
It was next to our hotel, looked better than what they offered. I have been to better Irish Pubs with better food authentic food selections. It was nice, clean and large restaurant.	0
I took my fiancee and my parents here on a Sunday evening. The restaurant itself is attractive. A nice view good looking chairs and tables and a cozy atmosphere that is aided by the wine bars and large chalkboard wall. The service was friendly but possibly had a hand in the largest issue of the evening. 	0
$10 bottomless mimosas. Good deal.Great for brunch with friends on the weekend. I wish I could give 3.5 stars because the food could be a little better, but I've never been disappointed with it. The breakfast burrito is A-Okay.	1
1 hour wait time for a table of 6. You can drop your number and grab a beer next door. We all shared pizzas and the bill came out to be $21 pp.	1
Great food great people always a good food. Freshest sushi I have had.	1
The beer selection here is pretty massive which is good, unless you&#39;re super indecisive like me. I had one of their burgers and it was good (not great, but good) but the real winner was their wings. Mmmmm...<br><br>The outdoor patio is a perfect spot to have a drink (and some food, mayhaps) and take in nice summer evening -- a cool date spot? Me thinks it is!	1
Loved the cannoli & hubby loved tiramisu. Pizza & pasta fresh . Def go back. The balsamic on burrata the best I have tasted.	1
I like this place, good vibe and nice beer selection. We just had some apps which included the meatball poutine and shrimp. Both were solid dishes that hit the spot and filled us up. I'd recommend this place if you're looking for something casual in the area or want to sit at a bar for a while.	1
The current plethora of restaurants in this category makes for a competitive field here in Madison. While the menu selection rings of authenticity and the location allows for convenience as a destination for the inebriated college demographic in the late hours, the food itself is selectively pedestrian.  On a positive note, certain items like the burrito suizo give the patron a nice composite taste which is tied to this popular genre. At the end of the day however, a restaurant must go the extra mile to distinguish itself from it's competition, and that is something this place needs to consider. On a recent late night visit, I ordered the enchilada, which, for $6.49 came across as a meager version of what I have had at other competitive restaurants. Another time, I picked up some tacos to go-although they met the bar with regard to taste and quality, there was nothing about them that stood out above the competition (with the exception of the hot sauce which accompanied the order).	1
After being on a plane that landed late, we were happy to find that Buca di Beppo was still open and serving food. The bar area was open much later too but we wanted a meal. Our server Hector was extremely attentive, polite, knowledgeable and professional.	1
Delicious! You order at the counter and then find seating. Even though the place was very busy, the waiters were very helpful in finding us seating and getting us through the ordering/seating process quickly. The food was fantastic and every person in our 6 party group loved their meals.	0
I came here upon the suggestion of my new yelp friend, Ian W! I am so glad I did, as this is definitely a neighborhood gem. The six has been open for awhile ( about a year), but somehow it did not make it onto my radar. We had the opportunity to go for lunch, and I'm so glad I did!Gazpacho- chunky, flavorful, lots of croutonsPizza Special- Pizza with garlic spread, tomato, and arugula. A+! Crust was thin and bubbly, just how I like it.Salad- Meh- nothing too special here. It was good, but also expensive ($13). I wouldn't order it again.The ambiance is really cute. Overall, this restaurant reminds me of a more low-key westside tavern. Happy to have it in the neighborhood, and I cant wait to come back for Brunch and Dinner!	1
white people sure love this place.	0
POT is sort of like a sadomasochistic foodie fantasy with equal amounts of pleasure and pain. Delicious food and painfully loud music. Delicious food so spicy your lips and mouth burn for hours. Coming here stoned just might be a prerequisite to numb some of the pain and enhance the pleasure. <br><br>The food is seriously pretty fantastic with flavors on the far right of the pleasure spectrum. <br><br>(Note: This is not traditional Korean fare so don&#39;t expect that. This is Korean food that takes a long bong rip of some fine OG. Open your mind, be in the moment and just enjoy this creative culinary derivation, dude.) <br><br>To start the banchan is amazing. White kimchi, sprouts, spicy spinach and fish cakes, each one is incredible. And just like at Korean BBQ the banchan here is freeee.<br><br>The Kush Salad is an absolute must. So is the Poke Me tuna sashimi salad. The flavors are so very delicate and complimentary. This course is like the soft patch of fur that&#39;s rubbed across your entire body before the bull whip comes out.<br><br>The Old School Pot with rice noodles, kimchi and bulgogi in spicy red sauce was one of the most deliciously spicy things I&#39;ve had in my mouth in years. They set that big ass family style pot on a warmer at your table so it stays bubbling hot the entire time you&#39;re eating it. Those noodles become like hot mini whips smacking against your lips and cheeks as you slurp them up. If you have noodles left over do yourself a favor and take them home, they are fantastic the next day eaten cold.<br><br>You&#39;ll wonder why the water glasses here are a cute 2 ounces and soon realize they want to keep you thirsty and let that fire burn. Your server is a super friendly &#34;sadist&#34; who stops by every so often to refill you and your eyes will light up like Christmas when you see that pitcher of ice water.<br><br>Then there&#39;s the music. Damn. It&#39;s like Snoop Dogg&#39;s birthday party up here, all they need is a cloud of thick smoke. Your ears are in pain, your mouth is in pain yet your belly is completely happy. Don&#39;t be confused, according to Freud we all have some masochistic tendencies. You&#39;ll love POT. You might want to consider bringing ear plugs tho.	1
They have top of the line guacamole here, and the chips are perfectly spiced. The food is yummy, and they really do have the best margaritas in town. The waitstaff is friendly and helpful, I've never had any problems there. All in all, a great place.	0
If you're going to purport to make a fancy burger and charge above average for it, it better be good. I've only found the burgers to be sub par and the fries average. If I'm going to grab a burger in this area, I'd rather pay half the price for a Five Guys burg. Much better. I have, however, been to late night Happy hour here and had a $3 (?) PBR in a can, which was a fun surprise.There was a short while when I came here for four mini burgers and four accompanying taster beers. That was fine, but more as a gimmick than an unforgettable experience. Overall, I'll pass on this place.	0
Awesome every time. Great ambiance, bar, menu and staff. This is exactly what a bar is supposed to be. Spicy tuna and a burger won&#39;t disappoint!	1
Food was cooked to absolute perfection I could not fault a thing. Great ambiance which made our experience at Canlis all the more fun. Staff were lovely as well.	1
This place defines trendy. I felt at times I was in an 80s space movie. <br><br>The main draw here is ambiance and presentation. I don&#39;t agree that looking at the posted yelp pictures ruins anything. They all pack much more of a punch in person. <br><br>I do agree that the donut bread rolls aren&#39;t anything except a waste of tummy space though.<br><br>Our waitress was a little aggressive in how often she came by when we were orders (and then proceeded to never come back after we put our order in).<br><br>I was at a party of 3 and we ordered: the chopped salad (good), the popcorn shrimp (also good), lobster pop tarts (good -- super rich though), and the lobster macaroni and cheese (good with huge chunks of lobster, though the truffle flavoring was a tad overwhelming). For entrees we got the seared tuna (perfectly seared and crispy), sea bass (I don&#39;t normally enjoy sea bass, but the bite I got was so good), and the chicken (it&#39;s a huge portion, big enough to share). We got the cotton candy dessert -- the cotton candy was good, but the cakes that come with it are awful. <br><br>We didn&#39;t get any of the cocktails, but considering how much food we ordered I think we cleaned up okay. We were so full after the appetizers that we all took half the entrees home. <br><br>Service by the end was pretty awful and we waited about 20 minutes for the dessert to come out and about 15 minutes for the bill to come. It got more crowded as the night went on, but it would have been easy enough to just let us know it was gonna be a while. <br><br>Definitely not cheap, but you probably knew that going in?	1
Chicken was extremely mediocre!I ordered the bool dahk with cheese. The chicken was very bland and you can tell that the chicken was NOT marinaded over night. There were measly pieces of chicken with more fat than actual meat in a majority of the chicken pieces. There was also a man smoking in the outdoor seating area. WTF. Clear health code violation! The only plus I found were the variety of hand soaps in the restroom to wipe off the stench of this restaurant.Won't be coming back here. Go eat at OB BEAR if you want to eat Korean styled chicken dishes!!!! This place is a joke!	0
$18 for pasta. But, I will admit that it is pretty tasty. Actually, everything is pretty tasty here.<br><br>I might&#39;ve felt better about paying for this if the service was good. There are a lot of wait staff, but it seemed super inefficient. As someone who has worked in the service industry since I was a teenager, I was wondering why it took 5(?) people to handle less than twenty tables. Maybe because half the staff is chit-chatting and dancing or just really not focused on the tasks at hand. It takes a while to get your food...maybe if that guy standing by the food window was doing less head bobbing and more...well...I&#39;m not sure what his job was.<br><br>Also, definitely don&#39;t do delivery.<br><br>1. It took over an hour for the food to come.<br>2. The food was cold.<br>3. They over charged us.<br>4. They compensated by giving us $10 dollars off our NEXT order. (Sounded like some United Airlines kind of service)	0
Love this new place, great pizza, great staff.....welcome to Sunnyside!My wife and I were there last night, had the fresh mozzarella and mushroom pizza that they made for us ..... Delicioso! Very reasonable prices to boot!	1
AMAZING! For starters I had no clue what to order and the gentlemen there were very informative about the available selections. I chose the sweet salmon bowl which was full of flavor to the very last drop! The entire meal was fresh in taste. Definitely will be returning and I recommend anyone who cares about eating quality, healthy, great tasting food to stop in and treat yourself! <br><br>An added factor is that the place is very clean and well organized! <br><br>Thanks for making my night! Good food does that for me! :)	1
Decent Mexican food at really reasonable prices. In my opinion the food is pretty mediocre when it comes to Mexican in Madison, better than (but more expensive than) Francisco's on the square but worse than(and cheaper than) Abuelo's in Middleton. I had the white chicken chile with quesadilla gill cheese (gluten free!), it was ok but I probably could have made the same if not better at home. The location at Hilldale mall is nice but if you are looking for great Mexican food in Madison look elsewhere.	0
Here is the Best Place in US. <br>It&#39;s awesome JAPANESE RANEN!!<br>Thank you for serving best RAMEN!!!!	1
Not worth it whatsoever! The burger was bland and lacked consistency to hold it together. I was not impressed and assuming most of the people who went here lack a seasoned palette for good food. Jump on the bandwagon and eat in mediocrity if you would prefer. I&#39;m assuming these reviews were given with beer mouth (the equivalent to beer goggles). <br><br>This was by far worse than Shake Shack, hard to believe, but yes it was a waste of my money. The place smells dingy too like stale beer from the night before. Try Paul&#39;s or Hamburger Harry&#39;s.	0
Standard LA Cafe/restaurant fare. Yummy and fun. Very LA crowd w/ celebrity sightings on the regular. Parking :(	1
We have been here a number of times, trying to like the food, but cannot. The patio is great, the beers are cold and the vibe is super chill, but the food is just average. We ordered the brussel sprouts, which were WAY over cooked and tasted like burnt marshmallows. The burata bruschetta tasted bland and not fresh at all. And the burger was WAY under cooked. Always disappointed with the food (in the past my veggie burger was also undercooked) The patio is great ..The service is okay, and the food, well...it sucks. sorry.	0
I have been a big fan of The Great Dane and living in between two of them has always been a plus for me. I always suggest coming here whenever someone new comes in to town, the people, beer and food have always been up to par. That being said the last two times I visited the Hilldale establishment I have been very embarrassed at my suggestion and just plain disappointed that the cooks and waitress had the nerve to serve me grease slop. Both times my guest and I ordered cheese curds and they were completely drenched in oil, soggy and gross. This past time not only were they slightly burnt, slopping in oil, but 6 of them didn't even have cheese in the curd which I assume is because it was cooked so long the cheese came out. It seems to me a new breading or curd is being used, please go back to the original. The other food there is great, but I truly love cheese curds and my appetite has been ruined by the choice to serve me and I would assume other customers In The best words crap. Please doing something about this Great Dane, because I love giving you my money, but right now that's not going to happen.	0
Been here 7 or 8 times now and I have to say it's not one of my favorite places.The number one reason is INCONSISTENCY.We've had good pasta here one week only to come come back for it the next week and find it has been prepared a completely different way ... and not good.Same goes for the pizza. The entrees, of which there are only 3, are not exciting and again have been inconsistent, especially the salmon... eeww. Number 2 reason: They will nickel and dime you here, which is kind of ugly especially for a restaurant with this pricepoint.The last time we came we brought 2 friends for a total of 4 people and spent a little over $300. before tip. The waiter notified us that we would be charged for the extra parmesan we requested. Mind you the cheese came in a shaker and was not even hand grated at the table.No bread is served at this self proclaimed "old-school Italian" restaurant even upon request, but you can buy bread and butter for $4. Aside from the tall waiter with the ponytail who's quite friendly & knowledgable and the super nice bussers, the rest of the waitstaff are personality-less robots. Valet attendants are very nice & accommodating.Never say never, but probably won't be chancing Maximillianos in the future.	0
So I often use yelp to help me make dinning decisions. But I have never written a review so here it goes.... Place looked nice from the outside which is always a plus! Inside was actually wonderful as described by others on here which was great. Then my 40-45 min wait(which I think is acceptable) turned into a 1 hour and 15 min wait!!!! Totally not acceptable in my opinion. Then to top it off the food was average. I would say 2.5 out of 5. Philly rolls were extremely greasy Mac N Cheese was ok. The truffle part was confusing to me unless waving the bottle of truffle oil over the top and not actually making it flavored with it is considered acceptable. Overall would never wait in line for an hour to eat at a place like this. Only plus side was the short rib sliders were great!! And lastly the part on the bottom of every receipt that I received while having 3 beers while waiting so long stated &#34;now accepting reservations&#34; which was a complete lie, confirmed from my phone call before I got here!! Good luck	0
A solid dining experience. The staff is super friendly and the BYOB idea is genious. Portions are on the smaller side which is a good thing. I had the salmon and my mom had the chicken. Both were delish. The almond stuffed dates are a must try. I&#39;m looking forward to going back and trying their lamb burger with truffle fries.	1
Came here for a Saturday brunch. I had heard great things about this place and was very excited to try it, but ended up disappointed by my meal. I have a feeling I should&#39;ve gone with what fellow Yelpers had raved about: the kale salad with two baked eggs... but I felt like corned beef hash that day.<br><br>The corned beef hash did not look or taste as I expected it to - and not in a good way! Instead of tasty bits of corned beef mixed in well with potato bits, I got rather large chunks of brisket and potato wedges with a poached egg. Usually corned beef hash is a bit more mixed and seasoned than they do it here at Northern Spy. Besides missing expectations, it did not look and was not very tasty. <br><br>My sister got the chicken and biscuit sandwich which was much tastier, but I didn&#39;t think it was anything special. The side of crispy potato did not taste great/had a weird texture.<br><br>The coffee was bitter and not great in quality - it was nice that the waiters came around to re-fill cups, but I didn&#39;t really want any more after my first. <br><br>It was very crowded - with people outside waiting to be seated - so get here early if you want to try it out yourself! Small space so not good for groups.	0
Awful food. Worst rib tips I've ever had, and it wasn't particularly close. I still ate them because I really like tips, but I did not finish the slaw, which had a peculiar smell to it.	0
I had a group of 6 and we were in Baltimore for an event at the Royal Farms Arena.  I wanted to eat at a place nearby and tis restaurant is only a block away.  The service was great and the food was very good.  The crab cake had no filler and was delicious.	0
I definitely love coming to this place. Although parking in Little Tokyo is absolutely the worst, Far Bar is worth coming to for a drink and some finger foods. The decor and ambiance is classy and cute. Sometimes at night they have live music playing in the background and it blends perfectly with the lights scattered right above you. The place is sort of easy to miss because it is located in a small alleyway. When my friends and I came, we ordered (from what I remember): The Italian Samurai (all the burgers taste the same), Wasabi Fries (do not order unless you like wasabi because the fries taste like french fries you microwave), mings wings (BOMB!) . Food was okay. Personally I liked this place mainly because of the ambiance. For drinks I ordered from their cocktail menu. I love juicy drinks so I ordered the Lilac (yum!) and some of my other friends ordered the far bar mojito (taste like any ordinary mojito), frozen melon (yum!), some beers, and whiskey. Overall, this is a fun environment with decent food!	1
Great dinner. Good service.	0
I recently read a review in the Wisconsin State Journal that brought me to 43 North, and I have to agree with the excited tone that the reviewer had.  If you follow my Yelp reviews, you'll know that I consider myself to be quite the savvy diner, so when I found out 43 North had a happy hour running from 5-7, I couldn't stay away. From drinks to dinner, everything on our bill was 30% off.  They were premiering a new menu a bit different from the one accessible on their website, which seemed to be an improvement.  Most of the dishes have an option of a small or large portion, so if you like to share like we do, it's perfect.	0
It's kind of a small spot, so definitely get there earlier so you can grab a seat. I tried their steak burger and a side of fries. The burger was delicious, it just melted in my mouth. You can also tell they make their own relish, so tasty!!! The fries were perfectly cooked. Crispy on the outside and nice and soft on the inside. They're pretty fairly priced too! Can't wait to go back and try those delicious looking pies!!!	1
yes. the burger is good.	1
Besides being new this place sucks. If you enjoy fruity drinks with no alcohol this is the place for you. Plus the staff is rude which was apparent since we were the only people in the bar on a sat night.	0
The doughnuts were heavenly! Food in general was great. Nice atmosphere but a bit on the noisy side. Quality of service is highly dependent on the waiter or waitress you get. I have had awesome service and have also experienced really mediocre service. However, taking the whole experience into consideration, I enjoyed Lola.	0
yes!!!!!!!!!!!	1

I live around the corner from BluJam so I am well aware of the long wait time. This past Saturday around 11am I put my name on the list for a party of 4. Knowing the wait would be long (and it was, 50 mins that morning) I went to the car wash down the street to kill time. I was already on my way back to the restaurant when I received the text saying my table was ready. The nice African American host quickly sat me at a table inside. As I was about to sit down a second host named Mc something came and threw me out of my table because my party was walking in and not seated with me. He was so rude, dismissive and aggressive for no reason. I have come here many times and with all the competition on Melrose this most likely will be my last despite the kindness of my waiter and the manager. Between the humiliation and another 20minutes I had to wait for another table, nothing on their menu makes that worth it. I think so much could have been avoided with proper explanation and simple kindness.	0
I started out on a quest to find Madison's best fish fry and stumbled upon this place. One thing to know beforehand is they do not take reservations and they pack the place on Friday nights. Expect to wait a while. This is a nice little neighborhood bar on the east side of Madison that has a huge following. They offer several different types of fish for the Friday fish fry. Fried or Baked Cod, Perch, or Walleye. I went with the fried cod which was absolutely delicious. I couldn't turn down the garlic chili fries or their home made chili. Needless to say I could have used a wheel chair for the way out! It was by far one of the better fish fry joints to go to in town and I will for sure be back. My only complaint with the place was that they don't take reservations and they won't do carry out during lent (due to an overwhelming amount of business) but it's good to see a business that does so much business they have to turn some away.	1
Great food, perfect pizza	0
Just so cute.	1
Was here last night with a large group for a birthday party. It was my second time here and at first I was excited to be back based on my experience the first time around. I was shocked to find customer service and quality control so horrendous this second time around! Long story short, this place has totally gone downhill and I likely won&#39;t be back. I wouldn&#39;t recommend anyone waste their time coming here either unless you want your food to come out an hour late and then take a half hour at the end to pay your group&#39;s tab!<br><br>Rachel and I got here about 40 min before our party&#39;s reservation so we decided to sit at the bar for some drinks and salad as an appetizer. After being greeted by the bartender we didn&#39;t see him again for another 15 min and sat around waiting for our order to be taken. What bartender doesn&#39;t ask for a drink order right away?<br><br>After everyone placed their orders we proceeded to wait about 45-50 min before any of food even came out. I was wondering if it was even going to come out at all! When our food arrived they brought everyone&#39;s except Roger&#39;s with no explanation of any kind...it was almost like the forgot that he had ordered anything. When this was brought to the server&#39;s attention she checked on it and came back to inform us that they had just &#34;fired it up&#34; and that it would &#34;be out shortly&#34; with no further explanation of what happened to the original order, nor an apology. About 10-15 min passes before the server returns to inform us that Roger&#39;s steak would be out soon and that they had overcooked the original one. Funny how they would wait to tell us this instead of being up front about it...I call bs!<br><br>When Roger&#39;s steak finally came it was overcooked and not cooked medium rare like ordered. How hard is it for a steak restaurant to not overcook 2 steaks in a row?! After this debacle they still wanted to charge us for his steak at first and then decided not to in the end...I&#39;m sure they heard that we were all Yelpers lol! But seriously this place is ridiculous. No updates on your food and no service whatsoever. It&#39;s almost like they don&#39;t care if their customers are happy or not, and we definitely were not.<br><br>At the end of the night we attempted to settle our table&#39;s tab. We had asked the server at the beginning of the meal to split our tabs, however, at the end of the meal she told us that this wasn&#39;t possible. WTF! Why didn&#39;t you just tell us that in the first place? The manager came out to explain that it was against store policy to split checks of groups with 6 or more people...Ok, so it&#39;s possible...you&#39;re just not going to do it? Who says that? Especially after the crap service we just endured? <br><br>It was a debacle trying to figure out the tab due to this and they had to run about a dozen cards separately. I almost wanted our group just to leave because the servers didn&#39;t know what was going on, except that they couldn&#39;t split the tab. If it wasn&#39;t for the manager coming out to handle the situation I&#39;m pretty sure it would&#39;ve taken longer than 30 min to figure this out and I would&#39;ve just left. I don&#39;t have the patience or time to deal with crap like this. Get your shit together or don&#39;t run business! We were also pissed to see a 20% auto gratuity which is bs because they deserve nothing<br><br>Save your time and your money and avoid this place. There are so many other steak places here in Vegas and there&#39;s really nothing special about this one. Steaks after overpriced just so they can do a &#34;happy hour&#34; 50% deal and even then the appetizers are $15, sides are $7 and sauces are $3.50 for such a crap place that&#39;s not even fancy at all.	0
The meat was good. (Just good, not great. I know places within walking distance that would beat it). What really pissed me off was the sides. I ordered the broccoli salad and the potato salad, each of which was inedible. At $5-6 a piece this is unacceptable, even for BBQ place sides. Don&#39;t waste your time and money. Go elsewhere.	0
Super yummy! Best Belgian waffle ever!	1
this environment makes you eat super fast because it's on an old school counter type. My bf and I both got the hickory burger and it was really good. Although different from the father's office burger (which i think is the best beside nepenthe), it was good for the price and the quality. The meat was very good. We had the apple pie thing with vanilla ice cream on top, it was good, but not as good as how people rave about it. I think I've tasted better apple pie. But definitely better than an umami burger. I've yet to try the counter.	1
Excellent service, fantastic food, beautiful room, a definitely repeat dining experience.	0
Extremely bad service!!! No smiles- no thank you- no service!!! Also floors and walls are sticky oily looking - bad idea!!!!	0
I love this quaint little tapas wine bar. It&#39;s pretty small but worth the wait. Sat at the bar while they were setting up our table and I couldn&#39;t recognize any of the drinks on the menu. I also wasn&#39;t feeling the wine, so silly me, I ordered the one thing I did recognize: Rum Old Fashioned made with Gosling&#39;s Black Seal Rum, angostura bitters, sugar, water, preserved orange and brandied cherry rocks. Talk about a strong drink. Ack. Never again. It was the cherry rocks that gave it a different taste. My drinking partner got the same thing. And of course, we got egged onto downing both drinks and felt the buzz throughout the night. Good times.<br><br>Food was oh so good. I&#39;m beginning to really like tapas. Simple approach, small sharable portions and really good flavors. <br><br>Some of the must gets:<br><br>- Creamy Polenta w/ sausage, cipollini - a staple signature dish, never knew polenta can taste so good. Creamy. Sausage gave it body, texture and a perfect amount of saltiness. I could have eaten 3 of these. <br><br>- Porkbelly Croquetas w/ chicken liver dipping sauce - pork belly inside a battered golden crispy goodness. Be prepared to fight for the last one. I wasn&#39;t a fan of the ck liver sauce. The croquetas was great on its own pillar. <br><br>- Patatas Brava w/ mayonnaise, siracha - ever had potatoes before? No, you haven&#39;t until you try these. Boiled and fried (just with a slight crunch). Paired with two dollops of mayonnaise and we had siracha on the side since some couldn&#39;t take the heat. One of the best potatoes I ever had, and trust me, it&#39;s that good.	1
Enjoyed the sandwiches, especially the dessert sampler. Prices are great and I like how you can try a variety of things. The meatball and pulled pork were my two favorites. I would recommend not getting the sangria as I felt it was mainly soda.	1
delish! We order from work every once in awhile.	1
the naeng myun was good. the galbi was good. the bibimbap was HORRIBLE.<br><br>THE SERVICE WAS BAD. NO HORRIBLE.<br><br>we walk in. no one greets. <br>we seat ourselves. 5 minutes later we get our menu.<br><br>10 minutes pass by no waitress. I tried waving them down calling them everything still no luck.<br><br>i went to the front to order the food. the guy took my order.<br><br>i tried to flag down another waitress no luck. i asked the guy in the front he says ok and he tells the waitress to get us water. <br><br>5 minutes later. no waitress i went to go get my water myself.<br><br>10 minutes later food came out.<br><br>went up to day. that was it.<br><br>i saw my waitress 2x and the end. <br><br>i served myself and got my own order.<br><br>yay.<br><br>not.	0
Oyster happy hour? Oyster happy hour. Yes, this place can get expensive if you order recklessly, but it doesn&#39;t have to.	1
We ordered tacos and meatballs and the tacos was ok but the meatballs were so disappointed, 6 meatballs for 12$ and no french fries or nothing else...expensive!!	0
I always enjoy ramen, but tatsu ramen has to improve alot of things.. there interior and system might be fancy. There ramen is soooooooooo salty and there noodle was all tangled into one chunk of piece. How could chefs and staff bring the ramen like that... one bowl ramen unstandable but othet bowl same !! I don&#39;t think they are train well!!!.. Wrost ramen I ever tasted!!!	0
Was in from out of town. Head east to the sleepy burg of Los Feliz. The food is inventive and very good indeed. Good retro diner feel. Go late after a night out.	1
I really wanted to like this place, so it pains me to write this review. I was so excited to come here after following the business on FB and seeing all the pictures of their yummy looking food. We arrived on a Sunday night around 8:30pm. There were patrons there but the place was not full. We wanted to sit at a booth and there were several available, but all needed to be cleaned. Waited for a bit for staff to clean the area. It shouldn&#39;t take that long to wipe down a table and sweep. We were finally seated after 10 minutes. Then we just waited and waited. No one came to take a drink order. There were a couple of employees that looked like servers just standing around and talking. There was a server near us that never looked our way. We eventually decided to walk out. No one stopped us and asked how they could help. It was a miserable experience.<br>Good food is important but service is just as well. <br><br>I realize that making a transition from a food truck to a restaurant may not be easy, but the lack of attention to this very important detail (service) is baffling. Maybe I will give them a shot one more time once the taste of that experience has worn off.	0
Really happy for the groupon! Good food great atmosphere. They serve alcohol! Pretty cool. Try it out if you are ever here! I had a chicken burrito it did not disappoint. My friend got a beef burrito he was happy with it as well.	1
My husband and I drive by Strega in Woburn weekly and have said frequently we should try it and as it was restaurant week we decided to try it for lunch. The inside is beautiful and I found myself impressed with how clean they keep the crystal on their overhead lighting, lol the things I notice sometimes. There is a lovely bar as you enter and hostess station where they lead you into the lovely dining room. The wait staff is wonderful, very helpful and knowledgeable. As we were dining on restaurant week we selected from the special menu that is three courses and they serve popovers which I love.  The whole regular menu looks wonderful. The food we ate was all very good and we will definitely go back again.	1
Love.love.love. Food drinks and hoe are great!! <br><br>Fantastic place to stop in for food and or drink! It&#39;s a great atmosphere filled with an ample laid back crowd. Can&#39;t wait to return!!?	1
A friend and I decided to grab a late drink after watching a Film at LACMA. We sat down and were immediately greeted by Joss asking us how we were doing and if he could help us with anything. The bar top had all sorts of fresh basil, mint, and berries. He immediately created a drink for my friend on the spot. She gave him 2 ingredients and he created an entirely unique drink around it. I'm a fan of the Irish Mules and got an education on several different Irish Whisky's from Gina their Senior Mixologist. She then made me a fantastic drink. As the evening wore on, both Gina and Joss were so attentive and participated happily in our conversation/fun night out. Gina even gifted us a "Ginger Rogers" which was so delicious. I don't make it to LACMA often but next time I'm there, I'll definitely stop in to grab a drink crafted by one of their terrific mixologists. Especially Gina!!!	1
Dockside review:My husband and I went here on a whim about a month ago since our friends who live nearby said the food was decent.We went around 5PM and the restaurant was not busy (half full). We ordered the Seafood Louise Salad, Lobster Roll, and half dozen oysters.1. Oysters: very standard with usual sauces on the side (cocktail, lemon, vinagrette) 2. Seafood Louise Salad: good pieces of shrimp and crab but had to search for lobster. Dressing was very good. The menu said our salad came with papaya but it was nowhere to be found. I didn't want to make a big deal out of it (thinking maybe they ran out) but when I saw the table next to us receive papaya on their salad, I was not happy.3. Lobster Roll: We waited almost 30 minutes for this dish while awkwardly trying to flag down our waiter. When we finally had his attention, he looked confused and said he would get back to us. Two minutes later he came out with the lobster roll and it was lukewarm, almost cold. Again, not happy.We told our waiter our concerns and he spoke with the manager. She came over and said "the kitchen is backed up, etc etc". Regardless, she gave us free coconut funfetti balls but given I am allergic to coconut, she switched it over to a red velvet cupcake. We went home and tried the cupcake and it was horrible! Tasted very dry and was probably out for a few days (I have made better ones at home).1 star for the Oysters and decent amount of seafood on the salad1 star for the manager trying to make up for the lack of service and mistakes with our food.I probably won't come back to dockside again since it is overpriced and service was not great. I might come back to try their ice cream though!On a side note: My friend went back again and ordered a Chai Tea Latte. The person making the drinks literally got a cup, put in hot water, a tea bag, and steamed milk. My friend complained and Brooke Williamson remade the Latte herself. Incompetent workers?	0
Good Food, not just good Vegan Food.	0
Five stars for this new Haitian/African restaurant that just opened up in the East Village. Great atmosphere, delicious food and friendly staff/owner. Special shout out to the chefs who were very accommodating of my gluten-free fussiness - kassava couscous is almost better than the real thing.	1
Great restaurant - just too loud.  Food wonderful - awesome wines, seafood and steaks.  Staff is great.	1
this review is only for the servicei have not tried foodwe came here for dinner, was seated and waitedthat's pretty much all we did. waitasked for a server twice - no one came25 minutes later - someone came and apologized for the "confusion"they said they were switching out staffby then, i'd lost my appetite and walked outtoo bad - i was really looking forward to this place :(	0
With our a doubt, this is a great restaraunt.  5 everywhere except steak..  it was a dam good steak,  just not the best ive had. didnt seem to have much kosher salt and pepper on it.. i like a liberal rub if kosher salt and pepper on my steak.. i asked for some finishing salt to make uo for it.   i would revisit in a second though...	1
My sister and I shared shrimp and lobster tacos along with fresh chips and guacamole. The chips are so warm and fluffy and the guacamole and salsa are really good. I enjoyed the tacos and my favorite were the lobster tacos, but my sisters favorite were the shrimp so it depends what you like the most. We also got a tamale, which are not stuffed. The chicken ( they have other than chicken) is on top on the tamale with sour cream and avocado. They are so delicious and the tamale is so soft and it's a crazy blend of flavors. I got a cucumber and mint water and it was really good and my sister got watermelon which was equally good. The churos with the homemade chocolate are really good to, they just melt in your mouth. The staff is so friendly, and always checking what you need. Our server was James and he was really nice and attentive and giving us his opinion and he did not let us down. Best place for tacos, hands down!!! The location is perfect and the vibe inside is really relaxing and friendly and the design is really cool and unique!!	1
Being that my boyfriend is from Spain, we have tried every Spanish tapas restaurant in Miami and Miami Beach and Rincon Escondido is the best priced, most authentic and tastiest place to go. It&#39;s super cozy and if you&#39;re not looking for it, you&#39;ll miss it. The staff is all great, including the owner, Emilio, and the food comes out very fast and is delicious! Do yourself a favor and head to Rincon Escondido!	1
This is the worst place I've eaten at in the Mission, on a quality/value scale.Maybe even the worst place I've eaten at in the Mission, period.The ribs taste like they boiled the cheapest pork they could find then slathered it with sticky sweet sauce so no one would notice. Almost everything else we had was poorly executed or over-ingrediented.The best thing was the bottled beer.This seems like a Southwest themed restaurant more likely to have been found in the Marina or Union street in the mid 1980s. Or Disneyland.People whined when the Mission got "gentrified" with double-digit appetizers and artisan whatev, but I welcome every Tartine and Delfina along side my cheap taquerias because they bring quality and variety. This place brings neither.	0
O'Learys is one of the best kept secrets in town. A place where locals can count on for a wonderful dining experience.	0
Dear P Dub Burger, Where have you been all of my life? From your juice, tender meat on the inside yet crisped to perfection on the outside, to your delectable creamy Sriracha dressing, you were divine! Onions and micro-cilantro finished it off, but I also added lettuce/tomato for a small fee. Your brioche bun was also hot and fresh -- simply baked to perfection!Since anyone that knows me well knows that I am a Sriracha addict, this P Dub burger definitely caught my eye. This burger was so good, and could have even been spicier. Maybe my taste buds are getting desensitized?? The only con was that it finished! I used to live with a friend who loved burgers so I have had quite a few great ones, and this one is definitely up there on the top 5 for sure.AMBIANCE/SEATING: There isn't really any seating inside the actual restaurant since it's so tiny. Just a few picnic style communal tables outside if you want to enjoy your burger there. Otherwise take it to go.SERVICE: I was the only one there at the time on a Monday night, and it didn't take too long for them to prepare my burger, maybe 10 min? If it was busy, I can see it taking a while. To their defense, these are gourmet burgers, not fast food (as a sign on their wall states) so you have to be patient. When I saw the burger for myself, I would agree. This is NOT fast food at all, but rather a delicious gourmet burger that is prepared with care, so be patient! It's worth it!	1
Great experience. Perfect for lunch, nice relaxing location near the pool, ambiance was really the perfect balance of hip vibe and beachside relaxation.	1
My husband and I loved this place. We actually intended to go to another restaurant on Capitol Hill that did not work out, and we randomly came upon this little gem that turned out to be a wonderful experience from beginning to end. We are not that into cocktails, but that is what they do here, so we ordered a couple. They were nothing short of amazing. The food is also fabulous - we ordered the sliders, kale salad, oysters and beignets for dessert - every dish exceeded expectations and were complete home runs. The service was also the best we have experienced at these types of places, which can typically be pretty snotty. The servers and bartender were incredibly hospitable, friendly and gracious. Highly recommend for a date night or evening out with friends. Great atmosphere as well.	0
Started with the homestead guacamole. It came with chips and a side of salsa. It was good but one thing-- chips were kinda salty. Would&#39;ve been better with less salt. <br><br>For my entree, I had the Frita burger with sweet potato fries and an extra side of asparagus because I saw it come out for another table and it looked delish. Frita burger was good but not hot when I bit into it. So sad. Sweet potato fries and side of house made honey mustard was really good-- maybe the highlight of the meal? Would&#39;ve been the burger if it came out hot and fresh... Also, the asparagus was a huuuuge disappointment. It was at least half the size (if not less) of the one I saw for the other table. Also, it was soggy/flaccid and cold. Wthail. Maybe that table was friends with the chef or something. There was a huge inconsistency in the portion and quality of food-- huge no no.<br><br>Also got a beer for around $7.<br><br>Entire tab was around $35 with tax.<br><br>Wouldn&#39;t do that again for the slow, mediocre service and cold, sub-par food.	0
What a romantic restaurant and the service was awesome. The food was great and as expected the wine selection is one of the best in Seattle	1
It was really kind of a gross out. Mayo mushy sauces with flavor combos that failed in execution. And I&#39;m quite adventuresome. the fritters were yucky as was the fried oyster balls were greasy.	0
HOLY MOLY!	0
I have been coming here for over 10 years and I always order the same thing: tuna sandwich "to go" or tuna melt if I am "dining in". It always comes with a mountain of perfectly cooked fries. The albacore tuna salad is always fresh and perfect and never overly dressed. The employees even know me by my first name and some of them have worked here for decades (seriously).The menu here is simple but it's proof that simplicity leads to success by keeping the menu short. While most people come here for the burgers, try the tuna sandwich. You won't be disappointed. I have been eating here since my mid 20s and the sandwich remains unchanged.The best part is they are open late and they have very friendly service. "Apple Pan" deserves no less than 5 stars!!!	1
Got a chicken sandwich which was supposed to be breaded, it was not. The bun was 4 times the size of the chicken. Sweet potato chips were chewy. Probably should've tried a burger, but I wouldn't go back.	0
Terrible place. The waitress only speaks Spanish for food order, disrespectful, impatient and rude. The food taste is ok. Will never come back.	0
Poor service.<br><br>I came here with someone else, and as soon as he sat down on a chair, the bottom of his pants got soaked with some kind of sticky, wet substance. Instead of having the manager come out for an apology (which we would have preferred) or at least an offer to pay for the dry cleaning bill (proper restaurant etiquette), they just changed the chair. We don&#39;t even know what it is - it dried into a hard film. The waiters weren&#39;t doing much either. They just lazed around while watching the Olympics on the restaurants&#39; TVs.<br><br>As for the food, it was okay. I ordered the Crispy Pork Belly; it was really chewy and tough (the seasonings were good though). I could feel my teeth wobbling as I was eating it. I couldn&#39;t even finish the meal (for some reason, it made me nauseous, which is really weird since I love pork belly), and I didn&#39;t bother taking it home. My partner had the lunch special. It came with an appetizer, soup, and entree. The appetizer (egg rolls) was really tiny - smaller than my petite forefinger. No complaints though - only that it tasted generic. The soup was salty, and I was told that the Pad Thai was average. I wanted to try the dessert but was upset at how they handled the situation so much so that I just asked for the check.	0
Randomly came here in dire need to try something new, and new we got!<br>The layout of the restaurant is pretty small, but intimate and felt like home.<br>We were greeted by Sue, who was also our waitress. She was very helpful and explained everything on the menu. Throughout she was very enthusiastic and genuine, and made us really feel at home.<br>I ordered the Moroccan tea which the chef himself brought over and did a long pour for me, the tea was one of the best i ever had, and by far better then Turkish tea.<br><br>For the appetizers we got the eggplant salad and tomato salad, both of which were delicious<br><br>For my entree I got the couscous Merguez, the couscous was very delicate, however I don&#39;t love couscous in general, and the Merguez sausage was soft and flavorful, and was my favorite thing of all the entrees we got<br><br>Sue also brought over this jalapeno sauce, forgot the name of it, but it was really good and had the perfect amount of spicy and flavor.<br><br>We all enjoyed this place start to finish, between the great service, great food and home like comfort, we will need to come back to try some other things on the menu.	1
The food was fine The brochetta could have been warm.....The service pleasant...the ambiance Hotel non plus...the noise especially when at the early hour of 7:30 PM they were essentially empty and the servers noisily resetting tables was frankly displeasiing. The menu on the internet bore little relationship to the menuj inthe restaurant....The plus, close to the Hippodrome...	0
EWWWWWWW!How the heck did this place end up with 4 stars?! I think I can get better Mexican food at a Taco Bell. I give them 1 star for having a very clean bathroom and preventing me from starving to death.	0
Excellent food and very attentive service - lot&#39;s of attention to detail in this little neighborhood gem.	1
Stumbled upon this cute little joint following dinner elsewhere and spending time at the last bookstore. Saw a sign outside which stated &#39;Stumptown Coffee&#39; and that was enough to draw us in. We basically just came in for dessert. <br><br>We were told the menu changes every night so don&#39;t hold high hopes in wanting to order what you had seen in photos from the night before. Opted to try their Coconut Thyme Cake and it was quite the delicious torte with slight herby flavor to it. Topped with toasted coconuts and candied orange peel, it was one of the best cakes I&#39;ve had in a while. Although we weren&#39;t there for a three course meal the service was still top notch which is really unheard of for pretty much ordering nothing! Plan on returning soon to try their entrees. Everything looked amazing!	1
I stumbled in here one night as my group of friends and I were starving and didn&#39;t want to walk too far for food. The place was spacious, clean, and we were seated promptly.<br><br>Food was for the most part abysmal. Actually, it might have been one of the worst tasting selections of food I&#39;ve ever sampled. The burger was dry and tasteless. The wings were dryer than a California lawn during these times of drought (too soon?). The only reason this place didn&#39;t get a 1 was because the house beer was decent, and the server was nice enough.<br><br>Steer clear of this place for anything other than a drink or two.	0
Let me start by saying I don&#39;t get excited about food in Bed-Stuy...EVER. I&#39;m no Anthony Bourdain but I know great food and Endless Summer has won the first prize for best fried chicken I&#39;ve ever had. I&#39;ve got to say I had the fried chicken sandwich and I really wasn&#39;t expecting what happened next. It was love at first bite. Amazeballs. Blew me away completely, so unexpected. So amazing. The best, ever. Ok I&#39;ll stop now but you get the point...<br><br>P.S The carrot fries are the <a href="/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&amp;s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">bomb.com</a>	1
Adding onto 167 fellow yelpers&#39; praises for this delicacy, I hereby declare my sincere love for the banana cream pie at this adorable historical establishment. <br><br>Holy pie. Yes, that slice of banana cream pie is going to make you become a faithful follower of The Apple Pan. Generous slices of bananas intertwined with sweet custard and eventually topped with light and fluffy whipped cream--this pie so incredibly unforgettable. I was on a date with this handsome artsy character when I first had the pie, and needless to say I was definitely more attracted to the dessert, completely ignoring his witty banters. <br><br>Oh, that pie. That sweet delicious pie captured my heart. I love it because of its honest appearance of an old-fashioned banana cream pie. I love it because of their use of sliced bananas instead of miniature chunks of banana mixed in a custard overload at other pie joints. I love it because it makes me giggle every time I see it being handed over on a vintage plate. And as I am writing this review strictly about the banana cream pie, sighs of contentment can be heard. <br><br>I love you, banana cream pie. Always have, always will.	1
The steaks were great and the wine was great.  Really impressed that they had wine/steak pairings on the menu.  Our waiter was scarce.  Didn't see much of him and when we needed something took a while to get him flagged down.	1
The food here was excellent. It is exactly as good as I expected which is great. The staff also speak perfect English so you can actually understand if you don't know much Spanish. They also serve complimentary chips and salsa.	0
Great burgers!!!!	1
so, i was famished and we were in the neighborhood. i went in and instantly loved the decor of the place. the exposed brick is amazing and theres a dance studio located in the back. the place is spacious and there were tons of people just relaxing on their computers.<br><br>they have a few drinks and sandwiches pre packaged.<br><br>also, there are an array of delicious breads/pastries on the counter. i went with the goat cheese/jam thin sandwich. 2.50 for this tasty treat and i loved every bite. it was a delicious combination of savory and sweet. i loved it! it&#39;s kind of an expensive location but not more than any other coffee spot in la. with a boxed water and the sandwich, my total came out to 5.50<br><br>my friend got a ham sandiwch for 7 bucks and he said it was pretty tasty.	1
Living in LA, this Boiling Crab is severely lacking compared to its other chains. The main issue is how dry the shrimp is. They don&#39;t add enough sauce. When you ask for it to be &#39;juicy&#39; (their word for more sauce), it&#39;s still heavily lacking. Given how butter sauce is the LEAST expensive thing in the bag, they should NEVER skimp on it.	0
I've been here a few times to meet friends who hang out here at the bar and drink - it's not my first choice, as the only good thing on the menu is the french fries and alcohol. I've tried to eat, and it is not so good. There seems to be alcoholics, bartender groupies, girlfriends, exes milling around the men at the bar, and some unsuspecting Castro patrons eating mediocre food. I also noticed on my night several people coming in, looking in from the door and walking away. I should have picked up the vibe they were witnessing.However; the main thrust of my complaint is my female friend was treated extremely poor and rude by a short little man of a bartender because she didn't acknowledge him and his ego as he wanted. She also asked for a special type of vodka that seemed to piss him off too, and then he decided he was going to ignore both of us suddenly. I was totally embarrassed for asking her to even meet me there - so we immediately left.I had been there 30 minutes waiting before hand and am not surprised at his behavior, as I had been sitting there and listening to him talk about oral sex, how to not get caught on Facebook by his wife and other inappropriate shit with other customers. I would never go back, nor put my friends in the company of such incestuous garbage behavior in an eating establishment. I had liked this place to get a quick drink before heading out, but this guy turned it all around was just plain rude - never again.	0
the food is really nice there and i love their Tiramisu!!!	1
Horrible, horrible service. They can&#39;t keep in order. Waited more than hour after we sat down. All the foods on the menus are greasy and salty. Not worth the wait and money.	0
My sister n i sat at the bar and found that while they were very busy the sushi chefs were more than capable...<br><br>toro nigiri...good...fatty...my sister prefers it not so fatty tho <br>caterpillar roll...this thing is surprisingly large n delish tho nothin special<br>spicy tuna...i&#39;ve never had it with a piece of lettuce sticking out but it was good <br><br>service is good...n u never feel rushed	1
Visited The Roof for a lunch meeting this week and came away with a positive impression of the place, largely down to the excellent view and service. The latter can range from overbearing and disruptive to non-existent at the other end of the scale but the balance was just right at the Roof.Food-wise the selection is adequate for lunch. Fairly typical fare for this this type of mid-range restaurant. If you're willing to pay much more for a fancier experience then try the Penninsula Rooftop. My burger was ok. Nothing too memorable. In fact slightly disappointing with the lackluster cheese bread and lukewarm fries - hence 4 stars not 5. Serve In&Out burgers here and you'd get 5!If it's a clear warm day (ie. 90% of days in LA!) and you're in the area then come here and you'll be happy you did.	1
I've lived in the neighborhood for several years, and during that time I've been to Luna Park about a half a dozen times. The food is always good, but the service is always frustratingly terrible and because of that, it's impossible to come here and stay for less than an hour and a half. No matter whether I've been here during lunch or dinner, the wait staff has this uncanny ability to just vanish for long periods of time, most especially when you need the check or a refill or something.The ambience is great here and the interior has a lot of charm and character, but it's just not worth the awful service. It's also not especially cheap either, so not sure why the downfall in service.	0
This Place is actually really good, I had it just the other day for the first time and I was thinking twice about it because I don&#39;t like trying new food when I&#39;m really hungry. The Burger I ordered seemed fresh, they had healthy choices in case you didn&#39;t want fries, and their healthy alternative sides actually taste good. The owner of the place is a young guy that is really friendly and he&#39;s open to combining things to help you out and gives suggestions so that you get more for what your paying for. Definitely recommend it and I&#39;m going back soon to try the burger with Mac n&#39; Cheese.	1
Great vibe, amazing customer service and the food is delicious. I will definitely be going back.	1
Best Pizza in the Seattle Area!	1
The crab cakes are the best that I've had in my life. They actually taste like crab! They were tender juicy and filling. The lamb was perfectly cooked but the custard was a bit on the sweet side. By the menu and the taste of the food I believe the cook is truely inovative.	1
Good for breakfast, good for late night. Not perfect, and not as cheap as it should be, but never a bad choice if you're in the neighborhood.Hear, hear.	1
Service sucked. Sat at the bar for five minutes while three bartenders chit chatted in front of us. Never gave us a menu or took a drink order.	0
I don't normally do this (every restaurant has their bad days) and I haven't written a review for a couple of years now, but I feel like I need to inform the people of Yelp! about the situation that I am going through with this restaurant. I had dined here on July 29th with a party of 12 for a birthday dinner with friends. It was a Friday night at 8 pm upstairs where we had our party of 12 and another party of 10 and a few smaller parties.. Lets talk about the food first. The food I had ordered was plain and simple. Burgers, fries and a cocktail. The burger was cooked to my desired temperature but holy hell it was bland as hell. I don't understand chefs that work in kitchens that don't season their food. It's like waking up and deciding not to breathe. I was certainly not satisfied paying $35 for burger, fries and a drink (tax & tip). The service was not as bad as their food. There was one server working the upstairs part of the restaurant trying to take care of two large parties. I'm not sure if they were short staffed or what not but that does not seem like a good idea having one server serve 2 large parties. Everything was slow from taking our orders, getting our food and paying. The bill came to about $700+ between 12 people. Normally with big parties theres usually a confusion on the bill. But not this night. Majority of the party had brought cash and I was the only one that didn't. The celebrant's boyfriend was going to take all the cash and charge it on his credit card and I was going to pay for my meal. Easy peezy. I thought my night and association with this restaurant was over....Until The Monday after the dinner, I normally check my accounts. What opened my eye and in my surprise I was charged the majority of the bill $700+ on my credit card not the $35 I had signed for. I ask my friend to check his credit card account and to see how much he was charged. They had mixed our cards up when closing. Now I get that its an honest mistake so I call the restaurant and tell them about the mix up. One of the guys named Chris said he would investigate and see what happened. The server didn't close our bills properly that is why I had woken up with that bill. Chris had said he was going to have it fixed and it would take a 24-48 hours. I let a week pass and nothing has happened. I called the restaurant again and talked to a guy named Jon now. I reexplain my situation and he said he would talk to the GM Brandon about it and have him call me....I wait a couple of days again and this time I talk to Chris. This time I ask him whats going on with the situation. He tells me Brandon would call me. And at the same time he gave me Brandon's email address..I send Brandon an email telling him about my situation to no response in addition to him "calling me back." I let another few days past to see if they credit me. Still haven't. And last week I talk to Chris again to ask him whats going on? I want to know what he and I could do because Brandon doesn't seem like he cares and is just ignoring me. So Chris suggests to get my cc # and my friends card to recharge him and then credit me back and said it'll take 1-2 days and that they are eating my part of the bill. I thought, finally I'm done with this headache....It has been almost a month now and I still haven't been refunded my money. I'm annoyed as ever so I decided to actually make my way to the restaurant this past Monday to watch them physically do it.. I walk in there and meet Chris and says that Brandon will be in shortly. Brandon doesn't even acknowledge my situation, no apologies, no explanation why he never called me back or emailed me back. He just takes my card # and "credits" me back and gave me a receipt and says the usual bullshit 24-48 hours.. Its Wednesday and I still don't see my money being credited back. This is the most irritated I have been with a restaurant. As a GM Brandon hasn't done his job. I'm wondering if a Yelp! review will actually make them especially Brandon do something about it....Still waiting for you to call me and email me back Brandon......	0
4 stars to the corn bread muffin. kinda sweet. i liked it. 2 stars for fried chicken - not much better than kfc. 3 stars for the yam fries. 2 stars for the mac and cheese. im only rating food. in terms of value, this place is worth much less than what you pay for. go somewhere else.	0
Gotta admit, after all the rave reviews, I was expecting much better when I took my partner there for Valentine's Day. We were seated upstairs next to the bathroom (major points off). Additionally, the area upstairs was so cramped due to the extra tables and in-the-way balloons. The food was well-prepared, but the prixe fixe menu was fish-heavy. Take a note, folks- don't bother with trying to attract customers on a romantic holiday if you can't nail something as simple as ambiance.	0
From the friendly greeting to the sangria, all the way through the delicious cheesy appetizer to the fluffychocolate Flan, it was a delight!	1
Food was good. Had a yummy lasagna. Overall Too expensive for what it was (food and wine). Nice decorations. Waiter was kinda rude but my boyfriend found him nice. Ok I'm Italian so I expect a lot.	1
I really love their food here, I've been visiting regularly since I moved into the area over a year ago. But I was really disappointed on my last visit to find out they now charge you $1 for any basket of chips after your initial first. I came here with a group of 4 people, and we received only one basket that was about half full when we arrived. If you're going to charge $1 for each basket after that, PLUS another .50 for the salsa, then be gracious enough to give us a full basket in the first place or at least one for every two people. :( Awfully sad, we'll be going elsewhere that doesn't charge us out the nose for things that are usually complimentary at other mexican restaurants.	0
Visited for dinner last week for the first time...spent the rest of the night on the toilet... <br><br>Before that happened...thought my meal was overpriced tasteless crap. I hear from others they are better for brunch, but honestly, I would never go back. ever.	0
How many times have I wondered, as the hot sweet sauce bored a hole in my soft palate: "I wish there was a gallon of beer I could funnel to make this pain stop so I can eat much more of it and experience still more pain." Which is all to say (and I hope I'm not the last to know): KYOCHON NOW SERVES BEER.On tap. In pitcher-form. Hite and Sam Adams.	1
I don&#39;t know what the food here tastes like, because for the first time in my life I walked out of a restaurant before picking up my pick up order. It had been an hour since I had ordered, and I was sitting for 20 minutes waiting for my food at the restaurant (after having been told it would &#34;only be 15 minutes&#34; when I initially ordered.)<br><br>Lesson for all you lunch takeout peeps: don&#39;t do it. You won&#39;t get to eat. They only care about eat-in customers.	0
Never closes, no locks on the doors.Prices have rapidly gone up over the years and so there's not as long a line down the block as in years past. Still has great breakfasts 24/7 and the menu is still pretty much the same. My favorite breakfast is the ham and cheese omlette, I think the best in LA. Can any restaurant make a better one that this? Pancakes are great too although they need to get better syrup dispensers, the ones they have are always sticky...	1
Awesomely-priced sandwiches and even more awesomely-price frozen custard sundaes, milkshakes, and other frozen treats.G-R-E-A-T addition to the neighborhood. So happy seeing this place packed every night!	1
Good place for date night. Bread basket was dangerous! In terms of look and feel, we sat outside but the inside is also a great setting. Gorgonzola fries and lemon and pea risotto with scallops were delish, and the beef tenderloin was cooked to perfection although I'd ask to hold the Gorgonzola since the filet was so good. Only little downside, waiter was a little snobby.	1
We heard the food was good, and it was decent but the portions are so deceptively tiny it was pathetic. Expect your meal to be comprised more of lettuce than the food you actually order. The beer selection is decent but lacking for an establishment that purports to call itself a &#39;tavern.&#39;	0
Good food. Lot of choices. Open 24 hours! They recently changed their menu and they don't have the salad I used to love. Now I have to explore new menu items.	1
This was our third visit to Spiga (hard to find but worth it!).  The hostess and waitstaff seemed happy to be there, the atmosphere is pleasant and upbeat and the food was OUTSTANDING, from the salad to the dessert. We ordered two different salads and three different main courses and they were well-presented and delicious.  We shared a ricotta souffle for dessert and went home very happy!	1
I live in the area and passed by this place a few times...thought I&#39;d give it a try. There&#39;s a certain charm to the interior or this place...kind of made me feel at home. It&#39;s a small family restaurant and the staff is very friendly. Prices are good especially for the huge portions you get here. I spent $15 and had to get a to go box because the two dishes I ordered could easily feed 3-4 people.<br>Now for the food:<br><br>I got the hand made noodle dish and dumplings. The hand made noodles come with plenty of noodles, beef, and veggies and taste pretty good. The dish is pretty big and I&#39;m a big dude who can eat. It seems to be made for sharing or would be really good for loading up the night before a distance running event. Trust me it has all the nutrients you need.<br><br>The second dish I ordered were the Buuz dumplings (they&#39;re steamed beef dumplings). They kinda remind me of soup dumplings because they are very juicy on the inside. Honestly the taste of these would go great with beer.<br><br>Overall a good place to check out if you want to try something different than your garden variety Asian food found in the LA area.	1
The onion rings are so light and tasty. And I am a tough crowd with the o-rings. The burger is pretty amazing still. I'm actually gonna bump it up on my burger list. It's so big... and girthy! It's like a softball of ground sirloin!The place fills up on weekends so don't always expect to be able to get in without waiting.	1
We were so excited to eat at this location, but weren&#39;t going to wait another 45 mins. After the hostess told us you&#39;ll be seated in 5 mins, we ended up waiting another 20. The service is extremely slow and everyone was still sitting after paying for their check. If you&#39;re willing to wait about 2 hours then go for it. We did then ended up just leaving. The line was out the door and still people sat at their tables. Basically the hostess needs to get better at time estimating.	0
Everything is wonderful!! Grilled cheese sandwich, the Mac and cheese, reservoir fries, and chicken club sandwich are all great! Love the half priced bottles of wine Wednesday&#39;s! Good beer selection. Love it! Will definitely be back	1
I was first introduced to Yasuda in 2008 and I try to go back to it as often as I can. I have also told many out of town friends visiting NYC to go to Yasuda. I think the fish quality is top notch and I like the quiet, subdued ambience.<br><br>In my most recent trip (about 4 months ago), I made a reservation for 2 - a good quiet place to catch up with a friend. I was told I must finish my meal by 8 PM (giving us about 90 minutes). I find that a bit snobby but ok, I get it, you have lots of customers and you need to turn the table quickly.<br><br>As usual, I have found the fish quite good but I found the service absolutely atrocious. They appeared to be rushing us throughout dinner even to the point of being unhappy when we ordered additional fish. At 7:30 (with 30 minutes left to our reservation)when we asked about dessert, they basically snipped that this is the last order they could take from us. I felt disrespected and unappreciated as a customer. It&#39;s not clear to me why we got this kind of treatment. We were not drunk. We were polite and said our &#34;please&#34; and &#34;thank you&#34;&#39;s and didn&#39;t fuss about anything. I have never felt less welcomed at a restaurant.<br><br>This is New York. Good food is plenty and with that kind of attitude, I don&#39;t find a reason to go back.	0
Went there for opening weekend and it was AWESOME!!! Will definitely return. Great place.to go if you are a carnivore!! And remember to go hungry!!	1
A great addition to the Upper East Side. As a Falafel fan, I have tasted bad, good and great falafel. Though, cliche&#39; I regard Taim&#39;s falafel to be one of the best that I have tasted in NYC. The environment of this place is great. Clean, well organized with a super friendly and helpful staff. The space itself is nice with lots of seating available. I had the falafel pita which was very good. A nice dark crunch on the outside and soft, greenish chickpea mix on the inside. Everything seemed fresh and there was a good variety of toppings/sides, all of which looked great. This place is very new and doesn&#39;t have a website or online ordering available yet, though I am sure both will follow. Prices are on par for the area. A falafel pita was $6.95 while the platter was $10ish....	1
Food was great, but server felt the need to add an extra dollar to her already generous tip. Noticed it when I compared my credit card slip to my statement. Thief!	0
First time here and couldn&#39;t imagine how high the view is (15th floor to be precise). This place gets pack after 8 so reservation is require. Had some drinks while waiting and the bartenders are nice. Reasonable drink menu...400 bucks for bottle of certain is ridiculous. The host/hostesses are very friendly and our server Paul is outstanding. Mussels are kind of small but the sauce is delicious. Steak frites(French fries and steak) is highly recommended. The special ribeye steak (14oz) is huge and scallops are good. They have good desert menu and crem brule is standard for this place. Would come back again and try something different	1
In my opinion the best sun place in the area great size subs freshly made great prices and very fast service	1
I had been waiting for the grand opening of this place so I had to go right away to see what they have to offer. It is a beautiful and espacious building with many tables and booths and a long salad bar, which I think will be their main focus of attention. I had to try it so I went for the managers special, a half sandwich (I chose an oven roasted trky panini) and a side salad bar (which is a nice size). The panini I got (if you can call it like that) was a wrinkled white bread with a few pressed marks, trky, guacamole, pepper jack cheese and thousand island dressing and even like that it tasted bland with no wow whatsoever, my God, I think I have tasted better sandwiches at the PDQ. The salad was better, they have a nice variety of toppings like beets, green olives, feta cheese besides all the normal toppings you see at other restaurants. Also, at another station they have like mini muffins, nuts, seeds, croutons and crackers to complement your salad. They also have an ice cream machine where you serve yourself for FREE.	0
This is a sweet little spot I like to stop into anytime I'm in LA! The food is tasty & the drinks are generous!	1
My First time here. We were going to a show at the El Rey and wanted somewhere close. This place over exceeded my expectations. The hostess that greeted us was freindly and sat us promptly. It took a little bit for the server to come get our drink order. Although I think he may have been the only waiter. After that the drinks came and the food. Every thing was great! The happy hour was definately worth it. Near the end of our meal the owner/ manager came to check on us. It felt like a family run resturaunt. Everyone was happy to be there. I would definately go back!	1
Meh. I've experienced better two stars.	0
Only so-so, which is disappointing considering it's in Japantown, so you'd expect the best to be here. While the noodles were firm and chewy the way I like it, the shoyu broth was nothing special. I had the pork belly ramen, and there are 3-4 generous pieces, but a little too much fat on them. I ended up taking the fat off the last piece and just eating the meat. I love pork belly, but this was too much. We also got gyoza and agedashi tofu for appetizers; the gyoza were good, though they came out last, about 10 minutes after we'd gotten our ramen, and the tofu skin was too gelatinous. My dad raved about the tonkotsu broth, but my heart still belongs to Orenchi in Santa Clara.	0
We were looking for a place to celebrate our anniversary and what a great find!  The service was impeccable.  From the moment we were seated, we were treated so well by a friendly and courteous staff.  We were well taken care of, but not to the point of being intrusive.  It was the perfect blend.  The food was incredible.  I love a good tappas menu; you are not committed to one meal and as such you get a variety of amazing tastes.  The lamb meatballs were superb.  The shrimp risotto was one of the most amazing dishes I've ever eaten.  I don't like scallops but I tried one from the dish my husband ordered, and I really liked it!  The texture and flavor were perfect.  We also ordered the date and artichoke wood fired pizza.  That was truly a wonderful combination.  Also, the atmosphere was very chic and fun, but still had a classy and cozy ambience. The music was a tad loud, but this is Vegas and to be expected.  I would definitely go back in a heartbeat.  Loved it.	1
What kind of big fancy heavily capitalized breakfast place will not poach eggs? If you don&#39;t want pancakes or omelettes, there are almost no other choices. This is one of only a few nonchain eating options around USC, which explains how such a middling to poor place has good reviews. Just one more sign of how bad USC trojans&#39; local food scene is. You have to leave the campus area to go to chicken itza, or downtown la, or ktown to get any decent food anywhere nearby: it&#39;s a wasteland of chains, bad &#34;new American&#34; restaurants like this one, and second- or third-rate versions of ethnic food. Skip this one unless you are desperate for an omelette or pancakes!	0
The best burgers in town! I think they are better than In & Out. Be prepared to wait. It get's pretty crowded but totally worth it. The apple pie is good too.	1
My roommates and I love Daisy! This restaurant is on a trendy, nice street and has a great ambiance. Their food is excellent (Egg Salad Sandwich is amazing) and, let's not forget, their cupcakes! Delish! It's a sweet little place and offers wi-fi, the staff is kind, and they do serve beer and wine.	0
I came here for the judo dojo party that my sensei threw and enjoyed my time here. I ordered a burger, which also included some wasabi fries and it was very delicious The burger was flavorful and the fries with the wasabi sauce on it gave it a different but great taste to it. They also have many kinds of beer and is one of the few places that serves coffee porter on tap. The coffee porter though was on tap tasted very good and didn't have any watered down taste to it. The staff were also very nice and quick to fulfill our needs. This is a great spot to hang out, if your around the Little Tokyo area.	1
Creative menu, well executed;  attentive, friendly service, and reasonable prices.... what more could you ask.  We made a reservation through OpenTable late Saturday afternoon for Saturday evening - 9 PM was the earliest table we could get, and the place was crowded when we arrived - had to wait 10 minutes or so for our table, even though we were on time.  But after that things were wonderful.  Home made bread with a dipping sauce to start, and a variety of novel dishes including a grilled octopus with white beans and spicy aoli - lobster ravioli brimming with real lobster pieces - beet salad with apple, goat cheese, and pecans,  braised short rib papardelle, and a chicken breast stuffed with fontina and prosciutto with roasted vegetables in savory broth - capped off with decaf-espresso creme brulee (YUM).  The wait staff was always available - never had to look to find them - they appeared at just the right times.  We figured our seating was the last of the rush for the evening, but we noticed when we finished, there still were several groups coming in to be seated... so a pretty popular spot.  Definitely make a reservation as there are only 10+ tables, and the bar area.   Intimate feeling - a bit lively when everyone is talking, but not a cacophony.  Prices very reasonable for the area.  Total bill for 3 people, including drinks and taxes came to $150 (appetizers, dinners, desserts for all)	1
Winner Winner Chicken Dinner!	1
I don&#39;t know how this place is recommended as the best chicken place by other reviewers. Popeyes is better than this place. Bought their special and it is not nearly enough food for what I paid.	0
Came here with a groupon. They have a great pastrami ruben. First time a I had rye bread and it was pretty awesome. Their 5 dollar chocolate shake was as John Travolta put it &#34;that&#39;s a pretty good fucken milkshake&#34;. I want to go back to try most their items.	1
I've known about this place for a while and finally ventured in on Monday. It was a bit crowded - perhaps because it was Memorial Day - and therefore the noise level was pretty high. It was fine, but I'd probably prefer to come back at a quieter time.That said, the food was delicious. We split the margherita pizza and the hanger steak special. The pizza is thin, crispy (sort of flakey), and very fresh tasting. The pizzas are rather small (10") and good for sharing if you get a couple. I could easily eat one alone -- but I also have a pretty big appetite. The steak special was excellent. I'm sometimes weary of specials because you just never know, but I'm glad we ordered it. The steak was beautifully cooked with a great sauce, perfectly prepared potatoes and carrots, and savory, heavenly spinach. I'd love it if my spinach at home turned out that amazing. They've got good cooks in the kitchen there, clearly.They have a large selection of beers and wines and the waitstaff was very friendly. I'm looking forward to returning and trying more.	1
this place is a landmark, an institution. an institution that i buy into, unlike the apple pan in westwood that i detest. the pantry has been in LA since forever, and it supposedly hasn't closed its doors in a very long time. going here is like to experience the old LA of the 40's or something, and it's pretty fun to think of what it was like back then. the food is pretty decent but it's quite expensive. they give you lots of cole slaw, it's pretty fun, and if you're lucky they'll give you toasted bread. the best foods here are probably the steaks and breakfasts. it's just good simple basic american food. make sure you bring cash, 'cuz they don't take anything else. i love this place, it's just so fun to come here and so tasty, especially late at night. if you just want some cheap nasty place after you went clubbing or something, go to such a place, like denny's or micky-d's, instead. this place is an experience, a piece of LA history, a monument	1
I came here for Saturday brunch with some friends. We didn&#39;t know that the seating was sort of odd, big group communal tables in the back, seats along the bar, and more stools against the wall opposite the bar. It&#39;s not really a great place for groups despite the back tables because you have to luck out and hope they haven&#39;t been used for various smaller groups, and it gets uncomfortably crowded during brunch. <br><br>I had a slightly spicy tequila and beer cocktail that was good. Though I swear I remember the menu saying it was made with ginger beer but they brought it out with Tecate.<br><br>I ordered the BEC: tomato, bacon, fontina, a fried egg and sambal on a croissant. It was alright. I&#39;m not a fan of thick cut bacon, didn&#39;t taste the sambal. <br><br>One of my friends got the Tri Tip Hash and the steak was really tough. My other friend ordered the french toast with Chai whipped cream. Half of his french toast was burned and the whipped cream was really over-powering.<br><br>They were also playing loud hip hop. Didn&#39;t really go with the vibe and I never see the need for blasting music during brunch. After the brunch rush the place got halfway empty, but our server still started setting up our seats for new customers while we were still putting on our coats and grabbing our bags. We weren&#39;t exactly eager to linger anyway, just makes me feel rushed. <br><br>They also put up a notice that they charge 20% extra for cards left at the bar. If you&#39;re drunk and leave your card the last thing you probably want to be told is that you need to pay extra when you clearly had the presence of mind to intend to pay anyway. To me that&#39;s just poor form for a bar, doesn&#39;t really make me feel welcomed. <br><br>I do think it&#39;s great that the kitchen stays open till 3:30am, so I may find myself here for late night munchies, but that would be the only reason I&#39;d come back.	0
We stumbled upon this spot literally like an hour ago. I feel compelled to write this review (also before I forget) so that perhaps this tiny capsule of exposure boosts this great restaurant concept in the heart of Downtown. Very hipster-like wooden bar along with the draping green vegetation seemed very inviting, hidden, yet worth checking out. It was clean and open yet had plenty of detail and menu was impressive! We ordered Pinot Grigio &amp; the arborio rice fried balls of goodness with prosciutto.. Holy mother of joy - I did not expect that! They were more than just fried balls of rice, it was literally the best thing I&#39;ve eaten all week ( I eat well). I&#39;m definitely coming back for more. Our waitress was Jenny and she was very nice, had a great attitude &amp; was very attentive. I wish It was more packed and more people would drift here than just going to Soya or Fratelli. Definitely an up and coming spot in Downtown &amp; if we get a crowd going here - maybe they&#39;ll do brunch ?!	1
All I can say is this a great place to eat in J-town. There's a little bit of everything on the menu for everyone. It was busy last night and it wasn't a big deal for us to sit at the bar and not necessarily eat only sushi. The chefs are older and so full of personality and humor. Oomasa is consistent.I am posting photos of the menu as well. Turns out Yelp only has the lunch menu posted in the "more info" section. Just in case you prefer to do take out.One caveat: none of their noodle soups are allowed for take out. The noodles are freshly made and tend to get carsick.	1
It&#39;s a good place to go if you only want to take some pictures and show your friends and say&#34;so cute&#34;. I think people are reviewing the presentation but not the actual food. Food are pricy and not worth the price. Our server was NOT friendly AT ALL! Well, they did give us free mini ice creams at the end, but still, would not come back again.	0
Gotta agree with Jopen, here. It's a no-go. Bougie, overpriced, and just not worth it especially when you can pick up better, authentic, and tremendously less expensive tacos from the taco truck at the corner of basically everywhere else nearby this area.	0
Went for valentines day prix fixe menu - we got there right at 745 and didn't leave till 10. Four course took over two hours. When we got in, we were seated right away.... But then it took over 20 minutes for them to even bring a menu. The set menu had a boeuf bourguignon that came with a steak and the waitress didn't even ask how we wanted it cooked - just brought it out cooked to medium. I thought that might just be how they served this dish until I heard the table next to us asked this question. After all that, boeuf was dry and mealy, risotto came out with crunchy rice, oysters tasted like nothing but salt and dessert was a mushy cream puff with dried out whipped cream topping. Highlight of the meal was the gougeres which were just provided compliments of the chef. Not to mention that tables were stacked so close together you had to ask other people to move so you could exit the restaurant.By the end I felt like I was in purgatory and I couldn't even leave because our waitress held on to the credit card for twenty minutes.	0
I had been hearing about this place for a while and finally tried it. The place is small but cozy. <br><br>I ordered an arepa de queso with shredded beef.<br>It was delicious!! It was topped off with cheese. They also provided us with pineapple sauce, hot sauce, garlic sauce, and pink sauce (my favs were garlic and pink).<br><br>I also tried the mango shake with milk, which was so good. <br><br>The young gentleman who waited us was pleasant, and gave us a complimentary passion fruit moose which was amazing. <br><br>I will definitely go back for more!	1
prepare to stink like garlic for at least 8-10 hours following consumption of any mr. gyro item containing garlic (i.e. everything on the menu!)	1
Lunch buffet is delicious and staff is great. The beef curry is delicious and plethora of sauces and spices make the meal flavorful. Many different types of traditional Indian dishes make the buffet great.	0
Eating at Kon Chau paralleled my experience with the movie Love Actually. My friend and I left the theater, and we both thought it was pretty alright. But then we got to chatting about it, and pretty soon we both hated it. Dropped plot lines, unlikeable characters, baseless cameos... Worst movie ever. <br><br>We started out on Sunday hopeful and hungry. The thing about dim sum - nay, the BEAUTY of dim sum - is the instant gratification. Walk in. Sit down. Get accosted by steaming carts of asian goodies. Not: Walk in. Wait to be seated. Wait for a menu. Wait for a waitress. Wait for food. It gave me a serious case of the grumps. <br><br>The turnip cake was complete mush, reminiscent of Elmer&#39;s glue. The taste was alright, proper flavor profiles, just over cooked or old.<br><br>The dumplings ALL STUCK TOGETHER. And subsequently fell apart before reaching your mouth. Bad for mouth feel and white linen pants. Luckily, my pants avoided the barrage. My mouth, not so lucky. None of the dumplings were fresh. <br><br>We powered through the gelatinous globules of dumplings, each time hoping the next item that came out would be the shining star of the meal. <br><br>Sticky rice wrapped in leaves is our favorite thing at Tropical Chinese, and we were sorely disappointed to find that this wrapped sticky rice didn&#39;t hold up. As my boyfriend astutely pointed out, something was missing: the umami. We laughed at &#39;umami&#39; because it&#39;s a funny word for pretentious foodies, and then we paused and agreed that umami was exactly what was missing in the Kon Chau sticky rice formula. The texture was alright; it was just kind of bland. <br><br>When you can go four bites into a sesame ball without hitting bean curd, it&#39;s time to go. <br><br>The reviews all seem to love this place, so we were definitely disappointed when it wasn&#39;t great and we could&#39;ve been at Tropical Chinese 2 blocks away and for about the same price. Besides the weird non-cart service, it certainly felt authentic. But not in the &#34;oh my god this food tastes like it was flown in from China&#34; authentic. More like the &#34;oh my god how did I end up in China, it&#39;s gross here&#34; authentic. Skip Chau and chow down at Tropical Chinese instead.	0
Excellent food and very inexpensive. Highly recommended.	0
I am new to Capitol Hill and for some reason this place stuck out to me. I have been there a few times to eat or just drink and I really liked it. I had the chicken fried steak breakfast and it was amazing my boyfriend had the eggs Benedict and loved it. Service was great. I have been in here during busier times and the service wasn't the best but it wasn't bad either. I have not had any sort of similar experience that other negative reviewers had.	0
I&#39;ve been a fan of Thai BBQ as long as I can remember! This is a chain of restaurants so the one is SSF is a bit different. I think since this place is OG the food is a bit better, I could be wrong. But everytime I come here I leave fully and happy. Great service and everything on the menu is always the bomb!	1
I love this place! The owners are the sweetest people in the world, and they make sure everything is perfect. Food is perfect. The west side Benny is my absolute favorite dish. And breakfast is served until 4, so that's a huge plus! The ambience is quiet and the outdoor seating is relaxing with the fire pit in the middle. I love this place and I recommend this place to everyone.	1
It is not very often that I can say I am completely satisfied with a meal, especially at lunch time. Today was an exception. I had read several of the reviews in yelp and was eager to give grill-it a try when one of my coworkers suggested it. <br><br>Glancing over the menu, the honey-garlic chicken noodle bowl caught my eye. Figured it was enough of a deviation from the standard chicken-joint fare to give these guys a fair shake. I was very pleased overall with the meal, the flavor and the quntity.	1
Really cool place with an awesome vibe! Not just a coffee shop!<br><br>Great selection of food and pasties for breakfast! Definitely an artistic/hipster decor - adds to the atmosphere of the place. <br><br>Great for time with friends and a good cup of coffee. Quite place and easy to hold a conversation (nice background music). Great thing is they also have lunch &amp; dinner menus (with a small beer selection) it&#39;s just not a coffee shop! But they do coffee very well. <br><br>I got a standard Latte and an almond Danish -- which where both very good. The Danish was just the right mix of sweet and soft Danish bread &amp; the Latte was just the right mix of espresso to milk ratio. Naturally sweet steamed milk with a semi sweet &amp; bitter expresso.<br><br>I definitely recommend both of these. Go here!	1
Best burgers in Madison!	1
Omg the best food truck tacos I&#39;ve ever had!! And the guys who work there were so super fun and accommodating of our lactose intolerance. I ate them 2 hrs ago and can&#39;t stop thinking about those potato gravy tacos. I wish they would park outside of my house	1
Very good Russian restaurant. All 4 of us thouht that food was excellent. Great service. Awesome place for authentic Russian cuisine. I always go to Russian restaurants all over the country in my travels, and this is now my favorite.	1
The first table we were seated at had small ants (several) on the table.  We asked and were  re-seated, but there shouldn't have been ants in the first place.  The food was good, but not unusual, especially for the price.  Dinner for 3 with cocktails but no wine was over $400.  Wouldn't recommend or go back.	0
Did not really impress me for the one time we ate dinner here. The small portions of food and the incorrect order taken was quite unremarkable. The sisig which came in a small sizzling hot plate, mixed by one of the servers was okay, not that great as i any other order taken at a flip resto, we also had the small chunk of fried pork with a small portion of steamed veggies, which was better but for the price that was paid was not enough even for one person. The garlic rice was not that bad, and also the bagiou drink that cost 9 bucks. All in all, within the small four corners of that dimly lit restaurant, it might prob take me a long time to consider coming again, i dont know when.	0
This restaurant is really awesome. I&#39;ve been there once only and I liked it so much! The food is fresh and delicious, taste like my national food! Waitress was nice. She explained everything, recommend me the best meal which was really good. I would definately visit this place again. Thanks to all of you who work in this restaurant. Hope to see you soon.	1
I have mixed feelings for this restaurant.	0
2.5 stars, the .5 for being new <br><br>I came for my first solo meal of the year, so I had really high hopes.. especially because it was within walking distance of my apt and brand new.<br><br>I ordered the salt cod hash w poached eggs. I have noticed that minimal seasoning is the usual at Milk Bar, and wasn&#39;t surprised to find this to hold true w this dish as well. I was, however, to find the poached eggs less than poached and barely any salt cod in the hash. The first poached egg I cut into released more hot water than runny yolk, so that it covered my plate. The second poached egg didn&#39;t release any runny yolk as it was cooked through.<br><br>This place is new so the understanding is that there will be kinks to things that need to time develop, e.g., wait time, service flow, etc., but dishes should be fairly consistent. <br>On that note, the service at the bar was pleasant and quick. <br><br>Decor was bright &amp; welcoming for a dreary Sunday afternoon. <br><br>Other reviews hold promise for the crumpets &amp; bacon marmalade. This had unfortunately run out otherwise I would&#39;ve ordered it as well. I&#39;m hoping to come back and re-try this place when dinner opens before I write it off for good. For now, no thanks to brunch. <br><br>BTW, on wait time.. I arrived at 145p, and there seemed to be a wait for a table. I figured less people would arrive but more arrived around 2ish. Your best bet might be to come early.	0
After all these years still one of my faves in Seattle. Have visited for breakfast &amp; dinner but happy hour is where it's at! Gourmet food for beyond reasonable prices. They have an early happy hour 4pm-6pm as well as a late night happy hour 10pm to close. We visited for late night hh this past Friday love the ambience sooo sexy with all the walls of burning candles. We started off with drinks I had the Katie-Mae vodka, elderberry liqueur, fresh grapefruit juice &amp; sparking wine but you really can't go wrong with any of the cocktails everything they use is fresh and the amazing bartenders take so much care in creating the perfect drink. We then started off with one of my favorites the Frise9e Salad with poached hen egg and bacon vinaigrette never disappoints, then followed with the Savory Crawfish Beignets with hot pepper jelly and spicy Louis sauce and the BBQ Shrimp with creamy Corn Grits both were phenomenal as always. Always look forward to coming back to Toulouse!!	1
Our server who is also the manager Gonzales, was great. Friendly great service. Took good care of us.fab	1
Came in for the first time today for lunch. Met the founder Ruben who opened the door for us and greeted us, giving us recommendations and a full run through. We ordered and sat down. He brought us a couple of sauces to try out, cutlery and extra napkins. I ordered the yellow rice with honey garlic chicken and salad. Everything was delicious and flavorful! He was always attentive of every customer present, making sure they were also opening doors for both people coming in and out of the restaurant. When you look around, everything was always clean as he would clear tables as well. Before heading out we got delivery and catering menus to take to the office nearby. As we left he opened the door for us once again. Overall: great food, good prices, spectacular service!! Great job Ruben, God bless you!!	1
I would&#39;ve liked to see more selection of foods and plants. The biggest drawback was how expensive it was. Can&#39;t say I&#39;ll be going back.	0
I've had dinner here a bunch of times. They have many vegetarian options.Both the baby kale salad and the watermelon salads are fantastic. The watermelon salad is especially refreshing on a hot day. The salads are very reasonably priced for the quality ($8 and $9).I love their margherita pizza, burrata pizza and mushroom pizza. I found the potato pizza a little strange for my taste. I've enjoyed all the pastas I've tried and if you ask you can switch the noodle type between pasta dishes.They have a very nice wine list with all my favorite Italian wines and it includes a cheap Nero D'Avola by the glass! Maximiliano has a romantic atmosphere, especially in the back patio which is well-heated. An overall winner!	1
Spent an evening out and stumbled upon this little joint. I ordered the chicken poppers, which I figured would be like popcorn chicken from popeyes, or something to that effect. Sad to say, I never got to find out. Here&#39;s what happened.<br><br>After I ordered (and paid $7 for a small order of chicken poppers), my wife and I waited for 20 minutes...and we were the only customers in the place. I asked the guy behind the counter what was taking so long, and he said the food would be right up. &#34;What&#39;s your name again?&#34; he asked, even though, again, I was the only customer in there. <br><br>The place is set up so you can look through the front counter and into the kitchen stacked with a bunch of frialators. For the most part, the two cooks were laughing and fooling around, and the guys appeared to be making something, but it wasn&#39;t my food. At one point the cashier went back there to ask what was going on, and the cook picked up the little red and white cardboard tray (think beach fries with ketchup) that the chicken poppers are supposed to come in and slapped him with it before filling it with some chicken that was presumably mine. Except it wasn&#39;t. The cook comes up to the counter and shrugs his shoulders, as if he was given the wrong order, and presents the cashier with two chicken tenders that had various sauces and parmesan cheese on top of it. Then the cashier tells me something got screwed up, and do I want something else to eat?<br><br>&#34;Yeah, but not here&#34; I said. &#34;Give me my money back.&#34; (He did).	0
Everything I try here has always been tasty and filling.<br><br>Real modern, spacious, and clean restaurant that never fails to cheer me up with their hospitality. You will always get your moneys worth no matter what meal you choose from. I&#39;m always around during breakfast time but occasionally they have live Mariachi playing during the night if you want to join in on some karaoke.<br>All food is freshly prepped, coming out steaming hot. The Machaca con Huevo is great if you&#39;re into loading up tortillas, but there&#39;s some type of seasoning they put in their Breakfast Burrito that makes this simple dish taste so damn good! Desserts are a must if you have the room for it, first timers for Deep Fried Ice Cream are more than welcome... actually I think I&#39;ll go get some right after I hit up LVAC this weekend. (Talk about sugar synthesis)<br><br>If i had to be picky on what i didn&#39;t like, it would be the salsa that is served for their fluffy chips.. to much onions can be pretty overwhelming Lol. Other than that, solid 4.5 stars:)	1
Awesome wood-fired pizza with a very casual vibe. I've had a few pizzas here, but I like sticking to the classics...oh, and the fennel sausage.	1
West of Pecos would not survive in the Mission without their amazing P.R. team whoever they may be. We found them via 7by7 mag and all I can say is if I wanted to eat at a glorified Chevys this would be the place. We went on a Friday and it was packed. If you want a Mission experience and eat in a hip Mission restaurant with amazing foods cooked by studied chefs this IS NOT the place. Clientele: Bridge and Tunnel maxed times 10Food: Pricey for what it is. Both salads we ordered had thick ranchy dressing. Not sophisticated but heavy and tasted fast foody.Chili was long strings of meat with a soupy base with kind of a pungent tasteChili Relleno tasted like Chevys and lacked anything out of the ordinary.Guac and chips. Chips were delicious. Guac had enormous chunks of avocado. Need to be thinned out and need a spoon to dish outMac and Cheese sounded amazing but tasted ordinary with little flavorMy husband ordered the steak which was tasty but again lacked sophistication. The food here is greasy and sloppy. Sorry to slam this place but it belongs near the ballpark or Union Square, not The MissionDrinks: The beers were super good and cold. The margaritas had bazaar enormous ice cubes which was fun but the drinks were not very cold! They also lacked the mixology sophistication for the price. Service: Our server rocked. That gets a starThe Decor: Cheesy kind of corporate feel trying to be hip and warm with a lot of wooded furniture.	0
The brunches here are amazing. The veggie turkey bacon is unreal as is the veggie eggs benidict. The polennta dish I ahd at dinner was equally as wonderful - a great place for veggie and non-veggie eaters (my fav type of restaurant).	1
I have dined at this restaurant many times. I often left thinking it was the best one out of all the other locations. The food this past experience however was less than impressive. Tuna, bland and did not reflect what was on the menu. Not only that the salad too did the same. The ingredients on the menu should reflect the ingredients in the dish, no surprises, nothing left out, etc. Customers notice. I will not be back again anytime soon.	0
Dropped in at 7:00pm sat nite. Easy street parking, wound up right in front. That is pretty much unheard of in SF. Place was bout 20% full. While the waiter was a sweet kid, pretty much everything we ordered was botched in some way, and took over 20mins to come out. That's a long tome for a few burgs. They brought out the wrong fries and they were room temp. "Sorry, let me get you the garlic fries". Came out even colder than the first. Can't imagine what it's like there when 50% full. But what was really funny was the john. Obviously they spent some $$ to make it look nice. Nice tile and fixtures, "art" on walls. But in the corner, a small table with all the cleaning products, brushes and plunger all sitting out in view. What are these people thinking?This might be the worst run restaurant in town. Clueless. Oh, and the food? Mediocre.	0
Before beginning to describe Tanglewood, I'll just mention what 5 start means to me.	0
Ok, so I just came off of a juice cleanse and all I could think and dream about were carne asada fries and a horchata. I pre-ordered this on Saturday night for Sunday morning because I was THAT excited.Sadly, this is definitely not San Diego worthy. I have yet to find the same carne Asada fries anywhere in Los Angeles that compares to San Diego.But 4 stars because the Horchata is delicious, they deliver fast, and the staff is very accommodating. The large portion of guacamole is pretty sweet, too.	1
We stayed at Hotel Wilshire for 8 nights. We came up for breakfast at least 3 times and I always enjoyed it. The view is fabulous and you see all of Hollywood hills. The staff is friendly and the coffee is fresh! The lunch and dinner menu isn&#39;t as great unfortunately. The Caesar salad with ahi tuna is salty as heck. The ahi tuna is over seared. The burger is put in a cheese covered bun. Also extremely salty but the patty is pretty good. It isn&#39;t overly pricey for what you get. The ambiance and view are definitely worth coming here.	1
Huevos Rancheros is great. I come here once a month with my boyfriend and we always leave too full but very happy. Apple crumble is ace, hippie sandwich not so ace.	1
I&#39;d probably give 1/2 star if possible. What are all you yelpers talking about? Ew! So mediocre! I started with their mediterranean salad, which is only cucs, tomatoes and feta. The cucumbers were stale, the tomatoes were tasteless, and the 2 tiny pieces of cheese were insufficient. The salads took about 35 minutes to come out of the kitchen, even though the restaurant was half empty. <br><br>I was going to get the Ciccettil of the day. I asked, &#39;do you make this here?&#39; No they don&#39;t! Why would I pay $8 for grilled eggplant from the store? The artichokes were store/canned, too. No REAL Italian restaurant with class would serve up that junk. No housemade pasta (homemade. ask what that means!) <br><br>The atmosphere is nice. Service is adequate. Give this restaurant a pass till they can up their game!	0
I decided to give this restaurant a try and my experience was just average below the good ones... Let&#39;s just start that the sushi me and my girlfriend ate were really good reason why I&#39;m giving 2 stars because the food is actually good other than that we were served by a guy who said it was the manager during dinner time and to be honest worst service ever! He has no knowledge whatsoever about restaurant industries I asked him a couple of things and he had no idea what he was saying and took so long for our drinks and check to get to our table and it wasn&#39;t even a packed night. This place definitely needs new management in order to keep on moving forward, it&#39;s a shame because the food is good maybe I would give another try during day or another day that the manager is not serving because he needs to step it up and is not only me I heard the same things from family and friends... Heard lunch is good and service is better during the day might come by and try again to see for myself	0
Most excellent	1
The service here is terrible. Wait for fresh pizza takes too long if youre working in the area...youre left with the dried cold reheated pizza thats available otherwise	0
The idea of not only grilling meat but corn, cheese, egg on the same circular grill is very clever. Meat quality is better than its counterparts but I never went back. <br>There&#39;s really nothing here that can steer me away from my ultimate Korean bbq place (the corner place) in Koreatown. It&#39;s a cool experience but definitely a one-time visit kind of place.<br>Overhyped, overrated.	0
We called at 6:30 for a 7:30 reservation for 2. They said it would be no problem and didn&#39;t even take a name down. Upon arriving there they told us it would be a 10-15 minute wait for a table. Strike one. The food was fine but nothing exceptional. They forgot to bring our half-carafe of wine with the meal and we had to ask for it. Not a huge problem. However upon receiving the check we noticed they had charged us for a full carafe of a more expensive wine. Strike two. After our dishes were cleared and we decided against dessert due to time limitations, they rather unapologetically asked us to leave because they had a reservation for eight coming in. It would have honestly been fine if they had been sincerely sorry, but it was non-genuine. Strike three. Perhaps this was an off night for the establishment, but I would not recommend it to friends, or you, dear Yelpers.	0
Ordered for delivery. Porscuitto and arugula Rome style pizza. A Rome style pizza is a rectangular sized pizza cut into eight slices. It was delicious! The peppery arugula goes well with the salty porscuitto. I also wanted the caprese salad but they said were out. Looking forward to trying their other pizzas.	1
Best casual restaurant in the Miami area, if not all of Dade co! I have been here at least a dozen times and have gotten the Tempura Filet if Fish and fried potatoes every single time. I know I need to try something else but I love the fish. Best &#34;Fish and Chips&#34; outside of England!	1
Stopped by for lunch this past Sunday. It was a long wait but once sited, the experience is well worth it. Everything looks good, ordering is simple.	1
I tried The Pantry for the first time yesterday. I actually waited in line one time before but was in a rush and ended up leaving. I kind of regret that now. I tried the french toast along with a side of sausage and potatoes. My girlfriend had the bacon and cheese omelette. She really enjoyed her food but I didn't try hers. My french toast was definitely the best I've ever had and I've tried it pretty much everywhere I've had breakfast. I wasn't fond of the sausage patties or the potatoes but they weren't bad. It's more about my personal taste. The portions are huge with everything there. The sourdough bread is amazing too. It sounds funny, but it is. I've actually emailed them to see where they get it.If you're ever downtown and in need of breakfast try this place. There's a reason it's been around since 1924. Also, bring cash as that's all they accept.As a side note, this is the only 24hr place I've ever been to that really doesn't have locks on the doors. I guess they seriously never close.	1
My bf and I went about a month ago. Food was good but have had better in Miami for a lower price and same quality. We ordered a sampler (not cheap). We weren&#39;t even halfway through the meal when my bf took a long hair out of his mouth. We told the waitress and she took our entire sampler away. We didn&#39;t even get close to finishing. Then, to make matters worse, all they offered was free dessert. They charged us for the meal even though we didn&#39;t finish. I have had friends who eat at Cheesecake Factory, and find a hair in their food get their entire meal comped and have been given a fresh plate, dessert, and coffee free. I would have expected better service, from what I think, is supposed to be a higher quality restaurant. We should have complained but I just wanted to get out of there. Not going back. Telling everyone I know.	0
Came here for lunch with the family this past Friday. The place seemed understaffed as our waiter seemed to be handling the dining room as well as the bar by himself. I went to use the bathroom only to find there was no handsoap. Notified them and proceeded to wait for someone to address the matter so I could wash my hands. During this time I watched 2 male employees use the men&#39;s rest room and return to the kitchen. How do you wash your hands properly without any hand soap? Got tired of waiting so got soap from the ladies room which was unoccupied and returned to the men&#39;s room to finish washing my hands. Confirmed the soap was still not refilled. I was quite turned off by this and reluctant to eat the pizza but didn&#39;t want to ruin everyone else&#39;s lunch. Kudos to our server for doing his best to compensate but the manager is doing a terrible job running this place. Family seemed to be quite pleased with the pizza but having seen what I saw...eat at your own risk. Sanitary food prep is apparently not a high priority at this place. Lastly, avoid the sangria. Sad excuse for sangria it was given that it&#39;s white wine with lemon and orange slices mixed w/sprite. Go to Canonita for real sangria that actually uses real fruit!	0
So I took my mother here for Mother's Day just last week. This place was amazing place to eat at. The food it's self was great. There portion of food is right on the dot period. They give you enough food so you have more room for dessert and still be able to drink a little wine and have side orders. The setting of this place is old fashioned. It has the old romantic scene at night. The light are dim candle lights all around and a great place to go out on a date. The parking it's self is a hassle. It's street parking and no lot. But other then that it's a great place to eat out. I wouldn't recommend as an everyday place. But a place to go in those special occasions.	1
Super friendly staff great atmosphere.	1
It's been a few years since it opened but I fondly remember the excellent espresso to this day guess that says something. Cool viking flavored town surrounded by water and interesting shops.	1
My mom came in from out of town and she loves a good burger. Took her here last night and her reaction to the truffle burger was priceless! She told everyone it's the best burger she's ever had in her life. I had the Royale, and hands down I felt the exact same way. Even the special sauces for the fries and the bar drinks were top notch. Above and beyond service makes this place really awesome. The server, Jake, and the manager, Ashley, could not have been friendlier or more inviting. Stoked to check out the new PSL (Pumpkin spice latte) Burger! This place is pretty bangin'!	1
I would like to stop exercising and healthful living/eating and try to shack up in Canter's for a month. The results may not be pretty but I am ready. The place is a time warp with deep Jewish history that fascinates me. The place is a 24 hr diner but I really am only able to comment on the fabulous chocolate ruggalah and sweet orange/cinnamon/raisin bread we got. Both were fabulous but I want to try it again. I will force my LA friends to take me there in a few months when I am back down. Fortunately they have parking next door with the friendliest attendant ever and he made up for the straight faced teen working the pastry counter.	1
First experience at Canters. I was excited to go, honestly b/c it&#39;s one of those places that you&#39;re supposed to try when you&#39;re in LA. What I experienced, though, was mediocre chili, average bread, a nice waitress - nothing spectacular. But what really bothered me was the annoying helping of racism (from the d-bag behind the bakery counter) - who saw me waiting there patiently - but chose to ignore me over and over again while assisting everyone else who was - how do i put this... certain shades lighter ...and then just stand there and do everything but help me - it&#39;s just enough to make me never come back. No thanks.	0
Wow it was delicious!! Staff were super friendly and pretty chill environment. Highly recommend it. Will definitely go back. If the line is too much for you, pick this spot and you won't regret it.	1
My girlfriend and I went here and enjoyed it. The workers were exceptionally friendly and helpful. The food was pretty good and at a decent price. We ate a bunch of food with leftovers for $20. It is a local eatery so it feels good to support my neighbors.	1
Bad customer service.ordered half beef pizza and noticed that the other had some beef on it.Seemed that the cook had saw the order incorrectly and tried to remve the beef from the other half but wasn't successful. I'd tried to remove the beef but there was too many.I approached the counter with this complaint and the guy said we can't do it for you because you didn't come as I first noticed it. But he wasn't show any sign of empathy and in no regards to an apology.Out of 8pcs, ate 3.5 slices and showed proof of picking out the meat.Another employee came and told her the story and spoke to mgr and got a refund.But the moral of my story is, that customer service wasn't there. No apologies and customers have to watch what we order make sure all the orders come out with all the correct ingredients as ordered.Also, had the bacon spicy pasta. Which I didn't know if it was pasta or pasta in bacon. So much bacon and so salty. They boast so much about no sugar, no butter and no artificial flavor. But make it so so salty!!! What's in it!! ?? Really, I'll Never revisit nor recommend to another soul. I've been there more than, 20 visits. But never had today's experience.valet parking sucks too. The attendanin guy is soo rude too.	0
Really good salad... Really fresh.	1
Food here is bad and priceyIts a deli? The sanwiches i ate here were dry, tasteless and bad, i can prepare myself the same sandwich 10 times better for half the price! Their menu is huge, some italian and mexican dishes, soups, etc. Service is ok, restaurant is most of the times crowded and noisy.You can see all pastries when you walk by, but dont be fool... that they look good doesnt mean they taste good!, i have tried their chessecake and chocolate cake, both were a disappointment.I would never pick this place to eat.	0
I love going to historic restaurants, this place opened in 1938. The breakfast plate I ordered came with a cup of coffee or tea. I ordered the coffee just to try it and ended up with a cup with bright red lipstick on it, the waitress apologized but this was strike one. My brother ordered a bowl of their famous chili and he immediately said this was canned chili and not home made, strike number two. After we finished our meals my brother ended up with a long white hair in his mouth from the cup of water he was drinking, strike number three. The employees are very nice and friendly but they need to really look at the big picture and clean up their act.	0
An absolutely surprising, positive, change of pace in the S. Miami area! <br><br>This cute little restaurant will leave you wanting more :)<br><br>We had the ham and cheese quiche - BEST. QUICHE. EVER! It is paired with a small salad; great for a not-too-filling meal. <br><br>&amp; <br><br>The crepe topped with prosciutto. This crepe will forever hold my heart. So, so good. It too is paired with a side salad. I asked for fresh fruit as well. The fruits were just that - fresh. <br><br>The service was good, food came out rather timely, and the restaurant is clean. <br><br>I LOVE La Crepe! Highly recommend, especially for brunch. Yum	1
We had good authentic Chinese food (the Peking pork ribs are especially yummy) and paired with the delicious pumpkin ale (Greenport). If you come before 7, it&#39;s happy hour and the ale was just $3 for a generous glass. Chinese food + Irish pub in a former chapel. What a combo!	1
Whiz is the spot to go if you like Philly Cheesesteaks. They really don&#39;t play around here. You must get your food here with the Whiz cheese sauce... otherwise there&#39;s no point of being here. You can get Provolone but that&#39;s not Philly! I got the Philly Wit Whiz, added some Bacon and Mild Peppers. Tossed in some Mega Fries and it was a wrap. Just a cheesy, messy 20 minutes of heaven. I really haven&#39;t had a philly like that in a while. They also have burgers that I&#39;m sure are good too.	1
Is Dick's the most amazing burger you've ever eaten? No.	1
Great outfit for Koreatown, but not my pint of beer. They have a good selection of beer, but I&#39;ve seen better. The food is pricey, and seemingly not &#34;special&#34; - though I give kudos for the presentation.<br>I came to this location for a friend&#39;s going away party on a Friday night. Parking was good considering I got there early. I placed an order for a Grilled Cheese Sandwhich (one of the menu&#39;s cheaper items) within 10 minutes of walking in, and didn&#39;t get my order until almost an hour later. <br>The place was packed. I understand. But an hour wait for a sandwhich that takes 10 minutes to eat - presentation doesn&#39;t make up for that travesty.<br><br>Now, about the grilled cheese....it&#39;s not fair to call it a typical sandwhich. It has 5 cheeses - thankfully, none of them are Blue or Gorganzola!<br>There are 3 pieces of Webber&#39;s white bread in this sandwhich. I have no idea what the cheese are or in what order they are layered, but on the bottom half of the sandwhich, a nice, thick slice of bacon joins the cheese. On top of the top slice of bread, shredded cheddar is melted and maple syrup -- yes, pancake syrup, is drizzled on top of the sandwhich and around the plate.<br><br>It really is a tasty sandwhich...but when you are hungry when you order, and you have to wait an hour for that order...savoring is not easy. <br><br>Overall, food could be more impressive, ok selection of beer, service was friendly, but could have been a faster kitchen.<br><br>I&#39;ll end with a benefit of the doubt that the kitchen staff could have coincedentally been short a hand on the night I was there!	0
Wouldn't label it Greek though. It is more Italian. The hummus was soon good though.	1
I love cheeseburgers and Norms does it right. it's not cheap $10 for a burger but well worth it. Perfect with an ipa.	1
We were really excited to try this place after hearing many great things. We arrived around 11:45 on a Tuesday (New Year&#39;s Eve), sat down right away, but waited over an hour to get our food. We saw three tables come, eat, and go before our food arrived. At about 45 mins, we asked about our food and were curtly told it would be right out.<br><br>Fifteen minutes later, the food arrived. Well, almost all of it - they forgot the oatmeal. The chorizo breakfast sandwich was really great. The Jerusalem bowl wasn&#39;t really my speed - a little light when I was looking for something a bit more hearty for breakfast/brunch. The oatmeal, when it did arrive as we finished our mains, was runny and sugary. Great iced coffee, and an excellent salted caramel babka pastry rounded out our meal.<br><br>The standout sandwich and pastry weren&#39;t really enough to justify the excessive wait and lack of explanation as to why our food was being lapped by others&#39; orders. We&#39;ll skip it in the future, but I have a feeling they won&#39;t really miss the business.	0
One of my favorites in Seattle. Awesome service just a bit slow at times. All the food is delicious.	1
Food was great! Ox tail chili cheese fries is a must try! Food got to us a bit slow &amp; it wasn&#39;t so busy.	1
Very disappointing. Waited 30+ minutes for food. Burger was well done, not medium, fries where cold, not well done, my faro salad was good but chicken waa soooo dry. At least they comped us the bad burger..	0
What kind of a place can you get your drink on with friends at night OR have a cute intimate date OR a girls' brunch all in one spot?? THIS PLACE.AMBIANCE: The view of the Hollywood hills and Wilshire area is really nice during the day and in the evening. FOOD/SERVICE: Food is a bit pricy for what you get, but service is ok... Hard to get the waiters' attention sometimes. All of the waiters look like actors-in-training and the people that come here are all very well-dressed and cool. When I came for brunch, food was MEH....I could make a better egg sandwich at home. But the mimosas were good! Check in for free fries!View was the best part of my experience.	1
Excellent food. We&#39;ve been here 4 times and have had 4 good meals. Hope this one sticks around for awhile.	1
Maybe it should have been named Serious Crust instead.	0
Love coming here! H.O.T. just opened in our neighborhood and has become my favorite local restaurant. Best salsa I&#39;ve had -- spicy, fresh and flavorful. I eat vegetarian, so I haven&#39;t sampled the meat options, but my boyfriend loves the Asado Fries. The veggie soft tacos and veggie burritos are flavorful and fresh. The tortilla chips are crispy without being greasy. Low-key chill atmosphere. Decor is fun and funky. Casual and clean. Prices are affordable. Harry, the owner, keeps adding improvements each week. They have outdoor seating now. Great place!	1
Was here too celebrate my birthday, was treated to a great meal and service.  Our server Dwight was very friendly and helpful.  The best part was spinning the drink wheel!!!	1
The food was just alright, I ordered the coconut curry chicken and prawns. Let's get into the service...A greeting at the door would have be nice. Also, upon waiting to be seated just as the sign posted said instead of being looked at with a full blown attitude by an employee wearing a bluetooth, would have also been nice. My waiter literally would not look me in my eyes, and even walked away before I could finish ordering. No matter how polite I was I got nothing but rude in return. During my meal there was no check-back to see if I was satisfied. Mind you I was the only one in the restaurant at 1:45pm on a Wednesday. Not even after clearing my dishes was I asked if I enjoyed my meal or if I cared for anything else. To top if off a party of 7 walked in and sure enough they get a nice warm greeting of a lifetime from the same guy wearing a bluetooth that started my bad experience off. The most attention I got was when the same guy saw me writing on the back of the receipt after dropping the check. He literally hovered over me asking, "what are you writing"? No manager on duty by the way, and after verbally explaining why I wasn't pleased with the service, he blames it on my waiter having to prepare a take-out order. No apology whatsoever...Nice to know it was personal. -_-	0
I don&#39;t care what anyone says, I love Toast. Their menu has everything you could possibly want for breakfast or lunch or even dinner. I love their house scramble, their fries (always served with a side of ranch, yay!), and their soup and salad/wrap/sandwich combos. My favorite is the chicken tortilla soup (I have yet to find better) with the Tony salad. Yum yum yum. Their iced coffee is delicious too and they are always generous about the refills... you can even get a to go cup when you&#39;re leaving. The people watching is fantastic here too - I love sitting outside on warm days. The wait can get a little long... but thats fine, I usually just got across the street or next door to one of the boutiques. Also, if you make friends with the hosts they&#39;ll take care of you ;)	1
I am fortunate enough to have earned the title of Honorary Jew among my friends. My boyfriend is Jewish. Some of my best friends are Jewish. What is another thing they all have in common? They would all punch their grandmothers for a meal from Canter's.It's almost inevitable: if I am in LA, there is a 99% chance that I will end up at Canter's with a full belly and a serious food coma. If you have not tried their corn beef reuben, please stop reading this and go right now. Wait, not yet. First, order some hummus with pita bread. And at least TRY the pickles (warning: they're strong). OK, now you can go.Their service is alright, and the place could be cleaner, but that is all part of the Canter's experience. In the end, you will have had some amazing food and probably overheard some oddly interesting conversations from the tons of old people sitting around you.	1
This place is my goto place for late night outings in Ktown. Highly recommend their salungtung, pork neck soup, and spicy spare rib. The rice is purple and delicious and the green onions is all you can eat. My only wish is that they have more side dishes.	1
Took my girlfriend here for her birthday. It was everything you could dream of - a tremendous view of downtown, fantastic old-school French inspired drinks, heat lamps, beautiful decor and a top-of-the-line clarinet/drum/piano combo playing some early 20th century favorites. I could not recommend this place more.	1
I had the pulled pork sandwich with kale.awesome. Many places claim to be new and different -this is indeed. I can&#39;t want to try the rest of the menu	1
View and ambiance 5 star. Food just ok..had the brussel sprouts very good and salmon (with skin on). Avoid the torture chamber chairs inside that are wooden and pitch you forward, outside are metal and a little less uncomfortable.16th floor has a separate rooftop bar to see and be seen.	1
There&#39;s something about this space. This is where I used to buy my newspaper. I looked forward to it each day. The owners were/are kind and beautiful people. The kind that says hi, how are you and actually means it. It&#39;s no wonder the restaurant kept the name. I stopped by earlier this week to grab a much needed coffee and was greeted by a friendly face. Today I am here for brunch for the first time. Sitting outside, of course. The macchiato was presented exactly the way it is should be: like an art piece. The breakfast gnocchi was #delicious #different and #divine. Well done, guys! #namaste #krupa #karma	1
I am conflicted on what star level I want to give this place so hear my story. I guess it all depends on what really matters to you and what you are in the mood for. So here it goes.<br>Was with the fam on a laid back Sunday and we were all in the mood for some fish and chips. We headed over to check on the fishmarket which is right no South street across from the Seaport. Seemed ok because it was far enough away that not as much tourists would hit up the place. It looks like a run down shanty bar at first. We were surprised at the no air conditioning situation happening. Whatever yelpers said it was good so here it goes on the food.<br>Our waitress didn&#39;t speak much English and there was confusion on what was available on the menu but we all ordered the fish and chips and got a pitcher of the sangria which ran for $25. <br>Sangria- A jar of ice with a little bit of wine, they added Captain Morgan and Triple Sec. The bartender who was a super nice guy said he was out of apple slices so he added lemons and limes. Weird.. I know. Since it was a warm day (fans going wasn&#39;t that bad inside) the thing was half water because of all the ice melting. No one drank it but me, ( what can I say I find the good in all alcohol).<br>The bartender (even though we had a waitress) keep coming over to say the food would be soon, which was nice.<br>Fish and Chips- you can tell they just sliced up and fried the fish. It was probably the best fish I have had ever (in a fish and chips way). It was perfectly fried and didn&#39;t have a greasy feeling. So good! The french fries could have been cooked more but I think they were trying to rush the food out to us for whatever reason.<br><br>Whoa we were full. So the fish being awesome, the sangria a strange mess, the decor was a bar scene, I don&#39;t know what to rate it, but I have to say if the food is good that is what beats the rest.	1
Not something.	1
Wow I&#39;m really surprised to see so many 5 star reviews when &#34;I&#39;ve experienced better&#34; is such an appropriate response. The food was delicious-however the portions were so small, that we left having paid the requisite $50 for brunch for 2, only to wonder where we should go next to eat, we were still so hungry. <br><br>Would much rather spend the time and money at a number of other places in the neighborhood such a Palo Santo, Applewood, or Perch all also doing the fresh farm to table experience-but better.	0
Eh...i&#39;ve given this place a couple tries...here&#39;s the short of it. It&#39;s expensive and overrated. Expect to pay $18 for an entree the size of a side. It&#39;s a restaurant to be &#34;seen at&#34; so be sure to sit outside or it&#39;s not even worth going. Oh yeah and Michael Cera eats there like 5 days a week so there&#39;s that.	0
Really the only downside of this great place is that you wish it could seat more people. Great food, unique and cool de9cor, and amazing specialty items. I'm a huge personal fan of unlimited mimosas for $10 Saturday and Sunday mornings. The parmesan and truffle fries and red velvet milkshakes are both the best of those categories that I've ever had. The homemade French onion dip is also phenomenal. Every burger I had is unique and excellent. Great date place, or just a really unique place for guests from out of town. Sensational in a word.	0
I agree with previous review about the price. I had the Mad Sconnie Burger and my partner got a Milwaukee burger, both are okay but certainly not the best burger in the area. The portion is small. It did not even come with fries! I had an urge to grab a dumplings at Pelmeni's next door after my dinner.We ended paying $30 for two burgers + one fries + two drinks. Totally overpriced. I see no particular reason coming to this place.	0
The worst service here!!! They simply dnt seem to even acknowledge your presence and you are left wondering is it you who is not visible to the naked eye??the worst service and besides they never ever give you water till u ask for it!the food....meh!!!ive had much better Chinese with much better service and much better price! Skip it n go somewhere where they know how to treat their customers!	0
Sorry I wouldn't want to give 2 stars, but yes.. i've indeed had better. The Cha siu bbq pork was overcooked which i always hate. I prefer the juicy-soft-melt-in-ur-month cha siu in my ramen.The broth was pretty decent. I liked it. The miso soup was a bit on the salty side but they give a good amount .. expensive though.Takoyaki lacked some flavor on the outside.The noodles was this ramen house's greatest weakness. It is soggy. Like disgustingly soggy. My friend described that it taste like soap. This is probably due to how soggy it gets. I like my ramen firm or at least decently firm so i can slurp it up.What also surprises me is the pricing of the items. It's a bit on the high end with near $9 a bowl and each additional item is $1.50-2.00.Adding in seaweed, eggs, tofu, corn, etc. might give you an highly overpriced bowl of ramen for what it is. At times like this i rather go back down to Shinsengumi or Daikokuya in Los Angeles area for quality ramen at a price point of under $7.00 with all the bells and whistles.	0
This place was rather disappointing. We had a groupon and so maybe our service can be contributed to the staff thinking we were coupon cutters or something, but there really is no excuse for how inattentive they were. We waited about 20 minutes for our order to be taken- to the annoying point that all tables around us were being served and a fellow patron had to request a server come over to our table since he could see how stir crazy we were getting. I can&#39;t even pin point which server was mine since we were interacted with so frequently and never by the same person. The food was mediocre- my boyfriend said it tasted like something he could have found at a hot bar and any of the local bodegas. I did however like the penne vodka- especially the $4 price point! Meh. I&#39;ve experienced better is right.	0
I&#39;ve always been a lover of Thai food and yesterday I was on the mood, so I decided to give a try to this place.<br><br>I ordered one of their lunch specials, the Mas-a-man Chicken. The specials come with either salad or soup. I went for the soup. It was a kind of miso soup with some sprouts, tofu and a little piece of chicken. Flavour was fair.<br><br>Then, the Mas-a-man chicken. Probably my expectations were too high after reading all their reviews here, but I have to say that it was a bit disappointing to find out that the sauce was very watery and apparently they didn&#39;t cook the chicken together with the Mas-a-man.<br><br>My friend ordered a fried rice with shrimps. Same case, the rice was OK, but the shrimps were cold, meaning that they didn&#39;t cook them together.<br><br>I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll come back.	0
Great hamburger, crispy fries, the garlic sauce was amazing and the chicken sandwich with ranch and buffalo sauce was great. Better than in and out burger. Bit into a chunk of fat in my chicken sandwich. Was the only negative part. Health score was high and it appeared clean, service was good and quick. Good beers on tap. I'll have to go back to try the bbq.	1
The brunch on Sundays is delicious! The view is great and they had a three-piece band come entertain the patrons. The food is wonderful. I had the french toast and its buttered croissants grilled and put with bacon and syrup. It melted in my mouth. We got the truffle fries for the table and turned out to be a great app. The only thing I wish they had was a bottomless mimosa option on the menu as well as better air flow. It was in the low 70&#39;s and the restaurant got a little stuffy inside. I recommend asking for a table outside so that you can enjoy the view and the amazing food.	1
Dope place. Reasonable price menu for the type of place. You know, young white crowd, bar, pub grub, sporty, classy decor. Food tastes absolutely great and the price makes it taste greater. Glad it wasn&#39;t overly expensive. I ordered the pan scramble. Smaller than expected but it was great. added extra turkey meat. Also had the garlic fries which were bomb. Tried the breakfast burrito which was meh. Basically ordered off the brunch menu. The regular menu looks way better and much more promising. Might came back and order those items. Hearing rave reviews for the buffalo cauliflower. Service is quick with the water! awesome!	1
Just ordered delivery from here. Overall I am disappointed. I got the magic roll, avocado roll, and philadelphia roll. The philly roll is mostly cream cheese, very very very little salmon. The rice is also very thin. The magic roll is forgettable. The rolls overall are very small for the price. Delivery service was fine, just really wish the sushi was better.	0
If I had a choice, I would not even put one star for this establishment! I ordered to go just in case traffic would be an issue heading home. As I received my chicken and literally wanted to sit and try a piece of chicken as I was starving at this point, the employee said you can't eat here because you ordered from the to go menu. Are you kidding me? You are kicking me out after I've spent money buying food here and they were not even busy and had a ton of space. This was simply rude and disrespectful! I even called their management and couldn't get much of a good response. I will never come back to this place!!	0
Believe it or not I have had some pretty horrible clam chowder in the Seattle area. This is definently not my experience here. It was absolutely amazing with great prices. The bread bowl is always a great idea with thicker soups. The service was fast and while the seating was a bit limited there is a nice area in the front to enjoy your meal.	1
In honor of Small Business Saturday, we took a trip to West 3rd Street to hit up some local businesses and check it out. We stopped in Toast for a light lunch and were delighted with our experience! I ordered the Toast salad (1/2 portion is a perfect size) and it was wonderful! It consists of mixed greens, pine nuts, sundried tomatoes, beets, and goat cheese. The balsalmic dressing ties it all together and the flavors are outstanding. If I lived nearby I'm sure this would be my staple dish.My boyfriend ordered a chicken sandwhich (can't remember the name) which had avocado and cheese and some other yummy things. He chose french fries as his side and they were really good! Very cripsy, not too greasy, not overly salted...I'm definitely a fan of the fries. I love the ambiance and decor. The candy in jars along the wall is really cute and the pastry selections looked scrumptious! Our order arrived pretty quickly, making this the perfect lunch stop for a busy day of shopping.	1
Coming home and being WAY too tired to cook tonight and wanting something outside the usual delivery I looked up Caviar delivery service and came across The Churchill. <br><br>I ordered the meatballs, cauliflower and mac &amp; cheese. It was here within 40 minutes of ordering it, and was all still hot, which is such a refreshing change. The flavor in the meatballs was fantastic, the gentle spice in the cauliflower and the mac &amp; cheese was pretty standard.<br><br>Really happy with the food and I&#39;ll definitely be adding them to my regular deliveries. :)	1
Went to dinner there last night and the food was horrible! The wonton soup was not good. The wonton was fine, but the flavor of the soup was bland and very different from the typical Chinese wonton soup. The eggplant and fried tofu with basil was GROSS. They incorrectly used basil, so the basil took away the flavor of the sauce. It was so oily and greasy, NASTY!The shanghai noodles were doughy and not flavorful. Again it was way too greasy. They were also very little vegetables. I don't know why people like this place. It is not good, do not waste your money.	0
The oysters are divine. The cocktails are sublime. My fave place to dine.	1
How I have taken for granted having this Colombian restaurant so close to home in Miami. Being born and raised there this was a regular for me. I have not found a good Colombian restaurant where I currently live. <br><br>This past visit I got one of my favorite dishes sancocho de cola and it was perfection. Oxtail soup with potatoes, plantains, yuca and a side of rice and salad...to die for! So flavorful and filling. How jealous I am of the maracuya juice, I can never get it tasting that good!<br><br>Decoration is that of a typical Colombian restaurant in Miami. Makes me miss home! <br><br>I love being Colombian and how I love coming here. Reminds me of summers I spent with family there.	1
The space is lovely, warm & bustling. The menu is huge (a little overwhelming) & diverse.	0
Me and my girlfriend found this place while searching through yelp for a place for breakfast. We thought it was pretty decentI got the Lumberjack plate and a Cookies n Cream Smoothie. I have to say both were delicious.My girlfriend got the Avocado Brie Panini and a Strawberry Vanilla smoothie. She thought the panini was pretty bland and the Strawberry Vanilla smoothie was delicious. We shared the Belgin Waffle and it was good!Overall this place was pretty great! Service was good.	1
Definitely an amazing experience. Was so excited when I snagged seats! Hands down, one of the best meals of my life.	1
I was there yesterday to have some brunch with a friend of mine. Was greeted warmly by a guy wearing a yellow keffiyeh scarf even though he was clearly busy. After about 10-15 minutes we get a table in the back. A few minutes after Napoleon Dynamite comes to greet us. We order coffee, get some water and a few minutes later we order food. 20-25 minutes or so go by and I start to wonder why the table next to us, who got there after us, has gotten their food. I start to see an interaction between the server and the kitchen staff that the order had been missed, which happens and that is not the point of this rant. It was HOW is was handled. No &#34;my bad&#34;, no apology, no nothing. Just a shoulder shrug and a &#34;I don&#39;t really know what&#39;s going on.&#34; Its guys like ND that do not belong in the service industry. Pedro for Pres!!	0
Prices are extremely good but my noodle dish (a popular Thai dish I order often) was dry and the meat tasteless and mostly too tough to eat. Our group had mixed reviews but none were impressed. Next time I will try one of the other numerous restaurants within eye-shot distance.Free fresh popcorn was popular with the hungry patrons, and food was served quickly.Beers from the bar were fresh, and the Guinness (ordered by my brave Irish friend) was surprisingly delicious. The King appears to have a happy bar following.	0
After a good night of comedy and music at Largo, I headed over to Canter's Deli where I saw, Adam Brody. Ah, he's Jewish, isn't he. Thought I'd invite him over to eat delicious Matzah Ball Soup with me, but alas, girl groupies put the damper on that idea. Oh well, forget the bars and go to Canter's for a late night snack and a possible celebrity sighting.	1
Tex Tubbs is in my neighborhood but I don't go to it much. The food is more Americanized, especially the salsa, so if this sounds like your kind of thing, the service is always delightful (but not enough to go back very often).	0
The food is good but it shouldn&#39;t take 10 minutes to get your drinks refilled!	0
Very good spot...This was my 1st time eating here and I had the House &#34;Dirt Dog&#34; and &#34;Dirty Fries&#34;. I loved everything about the the dog even the Portuguese bun it was in. The Dirty Fries were good as well if you&#39;re not big on spicy things you might wanna skip them. They&#39;re adding more items to the menu. I&#39;ll definitely be back here...hopefully it&#39;s once they&#39;ve launched their bacon caramelized ice cream.	1
This place could very easily earn a top position on my list of Seattle favorites. Definitely go for happy hour but make sure you're there about 15 minutes early to get your spot in the bar. There aren't very many tables and they're full before HH even starts. I was here on a Friday afternoon and thankfully got a table. We ordered a bottle of wine, cauliflower and crab soup, oysters, and fried okra. Everything but the okra was among the best specimens I've experienced. The okra could have used some help. This was only our first stop so we didn't stay for dinner. You do have to have a bit of a thick skin as people show up and try to intimidate you into chugging the rest of your drink and abandoning your table. Our server was very nice and made sure to tell us that if anyone bothered us, she would take care of it. If you're not bothered by people breathing down your neck as you try to have a delicious dining experience then this is the place to be.	0
We discovered by surprise this traditional Japanese place. We wanted to eat A little bit after going to Bryant Park and ended at the bar of this crowded restaurant. We ordered the traditional Teishoku sets and I can tell the food was EXCELLENT as in Japan! Really really good spot not too expensive. The air conditioning was too cold at the bar making this experience a little bit less amazing that what it should be. I will come back at a table next time with a reservation as we saw a lot of people not accepted because the restaurant was full. I can understand because it&#39;s just very good!	1
I still vividly fantasize about the goulash at this place. We were (whoaaa) LITERALLY weary travelers who, assisted by yelp searching, stopped here for dinner after days of driving east on 90, and the goulash was basically like breast milk: warm, comforting, perfect, seemingly tailor-made for my exact needs, and something I will probably never be able to revisit. My standards and will to live after a week in the car may have been compromised, but damn did this hit the spot.	0
One of the first places I tried when I moved to Brooklyn. I must say, it set the bar pretty high for me.<br><br>I ordered based on what was most recommended on previous yelp reviews. If you&#39;re unsure of what to order as you&#39;re looking through the menu, do yourself a favor and put down the menu. Order the goulash and korzo burger.<br><br>The goulash is absolutely amazing. It&#39;s perfect to share between two people, even 3. The korzo burger is definitely unique and quite good. I&#39;ve been in Brooklyn for about 7 months now and haven&#39;t tasted a better burger thus far. Like I said, this place set the bar quite high for me.<br><br>The only knocks I have for this place are the drinks and slow service. The drinks were unspectacular and didn&#39;t match the quality of our food order. In addition, the service was a bit slow for a weeknight. However, these knocks shouldn&#39;t convince you of not trying this place. The goulash and korzo burger will tempt you to come back whenever you&#39;re near or around bay ridge.	1
nice environment, good coffee and snacks, super baby friendly (although would welcome a fold down changing table in the bathroom), Thursday afternoon music for kids	1
I've developed and obsession for Umami Burger. They pack a ton of flavor into these 6oz burgers (if 6oz isn't enough order a side, but it's plenty for me and I eat alot). or would you rather be asked to supersize?I like coming here early to late afternoon when it's not so crowed. the staff is on point and the kitchen gets the burgers out fast, great lunch option. And the place looks great. Cobras used to have walls or partial walls up, but they've knocked them all out and it's much more open. And there is a flat screen tv in the bar area now. good job.My fav burgers so far are the hatch, socal burger (they nailed a gourmet in n out burger), and the happy hour smash burger was good (maybe some more pickle would do). I didn't care so much for the Port & Stilton (not enough onions), or the manly burger (i'd prefer thick bacon strips, to these chunk type pieces).	1
Have only been here once and ordered the Black Betty along with the garlic parm fries. Yummy in my tummy! This place rocks.	1
Hookah is great here. It&#39;s super strong and we&#39;ll mixed. They put the coals in these cages which prevents you from moving the coals but they are quick to blow out the bowls and refill charcoal. The food is awesome which is a lot to say for a hookah lounge. The Kind of people that come here are pretty diverse from the ghetto type to business men. Overall it was a good experience.	1
Deez Nuts: Bacon bits + roasted cashews + dried cherries + spices. Strange but they grew on me. Definitely couldn&#39;t finish one bowl between 2 people. I think it&#39;s more appropriate for 4-6. It&#39;s a nice snack to sample, but gets old after a few extra bites.<br><br>Rice and Beans: Beans and lamb were extremely flavorful at first. The downfall of this comes from over salting. I stopped eating because my tongue lost sensitivity to the flavors. I didn&#39;t taste the coconut in the alleged coconut rice.<br><br>Smoked Duck Salad: Duck was great, greens were great, rice was awful. The black rice was extremely dry and bland. It felt and tasted like rice taken straight out of the fridge after being stored in their for a few days. Since it was mixed into the rest of the greens, it pretty much destroyed the salad.<br><br>Service: Staff was friendly, quick, and attentive.<br><br>Atmosphere: No fan or A/C (when I came around 6p on a Saturday) so make sure to sit by the door or outside if you stop by on a muggy day. This place is casual and the noise level was minimal. It looks like a great spot, but don&#39;t be fooled, the food isn&#39;t up to par.	0
We were a party of five, including a 2 year-old and the staff couldn't have been nicer.  The tuna salad and warm cucumber salad were both delicious and generous -- the menu had a wide variety of very appealing dishes.	1
Let me start by saying that the food is on point and it&#39;s a beautiful location, however that&#39;s where the good stops. The drinks are laughable!! The have a Negroni that&#39;s not a Negroni, an Old Fashioned that isn&#39;t an Old Fashioned and the worst Moscow Mule I&#39;ve ever had. Then there was the service... The bartender was so distant and aloof, barley paying us any attention. We clearly didn&#39;t like our drinks, as we didn&#39;t drink them. I don&#39;t want anything for free, however a &#34;how is everything?&#34; Or &#34;can I get you something else?&#34; would have been nice. I can&#39;t remember her name, but she was a very unpleasant Asian girl. I&#39;m sad to say that we won&#39;t be returning, I can go somewhere else and be treated poorly and be charged a lot... Best of luck Playa Provisions.	0
The curries (particularly the massaman and panang) and pad thai are excellent; the best in the area.	1
The Far Bar is phenomenal. Absolutely beautiful setting outside with the string of small Christmas lights hovering over us. It's honestly such a romantic place, yet very chill. You must get the "Far Bar Roll" - $10.00. It has crab, avocado, cucumber out: spicy tuna, dynamite sauce with jalapeno. The jalapeno is BOMB. It's so fusion and innovative there. And the beer is GREAT! If you like craft beers and great food. Go here.	1
I was so disappointed by the ramen here! They were stingy on the toppings, the broth was salty and not impressive, but the noodles were the perfect texture. You're better off getting your ramen fix at tampopo across the street or in san Mateo Dojo Ramen....T^T	0
Others will gush in more detail.	1
I live down the block from this place and I'm lazy, so I'm so glad to have this restaurant around. I've been probably four or five times now, and I've always come away pleased. I like the decorations-there's a big mural of cherry blossom trees and everything looks clean and well thought out.	0
I was not impressed. Weird tastes for their food. Nice staff, that let us try a bunch of stuff like their pastrami.Speaking of their "home made" pastrami it tasted just like pastrami I could get from Smart and Final's brand First Street...I'm not saying that it is from Smart and Final but it tasted like it.Nothing was impressive and it was $60 or so for 4 of us and 3 beers.Would not come back.	0
I&#39;m not sure why people were soooooo amazed by their beef ramen, but it was very disappointing. It was full of beef flavor; otherwise, very plain. The hai nan chicken rice my mom ordered was nasty. The white meat was so tough? Whatever they did, even the dipping sauces didn&#39;t help. Fish porridge, it was pretty thick. Didn&#39;t look that appetizing. Overall, given the price of the food, it was ok, but I doubt I&#39;d be coming back. Looking at the four star on yelp, I feel like I really got cheated. :( I had to give this a two star. <br><br>On another note, why do these food places ALWAYSSSSS forget my drink? Food #2 place that forgot my drink during my trip in vegas.	0
Was pretty happy with my first time eating the ramen burger, at first I was concerned that the noodle would be too crispy, but was good to see the ramen was cooked soft, yet can hold together as "buns" around the burger.The teriyaki sauce they used had sweet Caramelized onions inside for a sweet tangy flavor. The only thing I wished they had was another sauce beside ketchup I could have put on, since I'm in the habit of altering the taste of my food half way through, so as to get 2 tastes in 1 food. For example, I would eat the second half of my In and Out burger with the secret sauce, the first half with plain old ketchup. Other than that I wish they had seats so I can eat it as soon as it comes out. If I drive it home it might be soggy. If I eat it in my car, that's fine too but the sauce can get all over the place. Good thing the guy remembered to give me plenty of napkins.	1
My friend just got kicked out of here for having a laptop. According to the to person kicking him out, "Our owner doesn't like laptops."They have free wi-fi by the way.Also, this is Carmeggedon II weekend. When news, and local governments are begging everyone to stay local, which is what we just tried doing.I'm thoroughly shocked. Why have free wifi? Maybe there's a ulterior motive for kicking him out, but I'm so very disappointed in this place.Obviously never coming back.	0
I really like this place a lot. It was a fun and new experience. The service was so good, we had a reservation and the place they sat us was really loud and too close to everyone, so I asked the waiter if there was any way to get a booth or somewhere quieter, and he said they had a place in the patio, so he moved us there. It was so much better, they kept asking us if everything was good and if we needed anything. They were there always making sure everything was good. The food was good and I can&#39;t wait to come back !	1
Went early to avoid noise. Food excellent. Can be very loud.	1
I went to Grub for Sunday brunch with a couple of friends and was really excited to try the &#39;crack bacon&#39; that everyone was raving about. We came around 10:45AM and there was a lot of seating (before the morning rush came in). It is a cozy venue with random pieces of decor. They give you a bowl of complimentary mixed, fruity cereal, which was surprising and different. My friend and I ordered the &#39;Kevin Bacon&#39; that came with 3 eggs, garlic and herb roasted potatoes, 2 slices of &#39;crack bacon,&#39; and wheat toast. <br><br>The food was sub par and easily something I could have made at home. The crack bacon had some interesting flavor combinations and was undeniably tasty. However, that following evening and the day after, both my friend and I suffered from food poisoning from the &#39;crack&#39; bacon. It was slightly undercooked, contaminated, and unacceptable. Given the rave reviews on Yelp, I am extremely disappointed in the quality of food and poor customer service.	0
Usually love this place, but if the bartender with the Afro and classes is working then you better run for the hills. Slow as hell. Messed up my single tab (2 drinks, 1 sandwich), even though I ordered everything personally from the bar. Forgot to put my friends sandwich order in completely. Took me 15 minutes to close out because he couldn&#39;t figure out how to replace the paper in the credit card machine. <br><br>Speck was still good, just as usual.	0
Raw Food Vegan Delight</p><p>This is a raw food vegan restaurant that is an absolute delight. The quality of the ingredients is phenomenal, the flavours are incredible, and the dishes are unique. Even if you push the recent fad push towards this raw food, you can appreciate the care and quality of the food and the dining experience at Pure Food and Wine.</p><p>There really is something for everyone here...the menu is diverse and encompasses a number of different cultures from East Indian, to Mexican, to Japanese.</p><p>The classic sundae is a showstopper!	1
Great little spot in the Orlando Hotel. Been here a couple times and enjoyed it every time. Love that its half inside/outside,,, food &amp; drinks are also great. Good for a casual date or with a group of friends. Would deff be back!	1
View: amazing... that's it. Let me share my evening with as we just came back from Perch.Let me just start of how excited we were to eat at Perch tonight for my birthday, as we have heard and read great reviews.We sat down at 9:01I ordered the Lobster Bisque at 9:15... Lobster Bisque came to our table, luke warm and hardly no flavor at 9:52 pm. No bread, no nothing -for such an expensive place.. come now.My girlfriend ordered the fillet of beef, received at 10:10 (an hour AFTER we ordered)!! Overcooked and charred. I ordered the Fish -it was edible.We ordered a coke at the time we received our entrees, we got the coke AFTER we paid our bill.It was such a hopeful night with such disappointment.We were told the chef was in training; if a chef is in training, and mediocre food and service are delivered.... prices should not be as high.What such disappointment.The view is lovely, that's about it.	0
Bad food and awful service = we'll never go back. Four of us went out for a birthday dinner and could not wait to get out. Allow me to 'splain...	0
A more modern and cleaner version of the Cuban cafeterias on the SW 12th Avenue block that were made famous by Willy Chirino&#39;s &#34;Ya Viene Llegando&#34; (late 80&#39;s political Salsa song), Little Bread does its forebears right with a tastier update on the classic Cuban sandwich and Cuban music soundtrack.<br><br>I stopped by for lunch today and tried their updated Original Cuban Sandwich. In addition to the traditional slices of ham and pernil (pork loin), Chef Albert remixes the flavor by throwing in Salami, pork belly rillette, and sweet Serrano Ham. The sweetness lingers in your mouth while mixing in mustard (instead of the traditional mantequilla) and swiss cheese. I forgot to opt out of the pickles, but the other flavors concealed those green things. The malanga chips I ordered with it were nice and crispy, but could have had less salt. I also liked that the sandwich was stacked and not skimping out on meat.<br><br>Though they didn&#39;t have a coffee machine for the obligatory cortadito, I did enjoy a Joe&#39;s soda sweet peach iced tea. My panetela de guayaba (guava bundt cake and an update on the classic cuban pastry was riquisimo and a perfect closing to my modern Cuban meal. <br><br>Service was also a plus, with Chef Albert taking the time to answer my question and just as importantly, listening to the aforementioned comment on the malanga chips. Welcome, and I plan to make it a food stop. Dale!	1
For months now, I've laid off beef, gluten and sugar. I've become a raw chef, known and respected in my community, with tiny vegan elves following me everywhere I got, eating bean sprouts out of my hand. I'm almost not exaggerating here. Today, I was near one of my old favorite spots, Apple Pan. I didn't want to go, I've moved on from eating the American Way, but I'm so rarely in the Pico area that I decided I just had to. For old times sake. I was going to go with my favorite hamburger in town, the Hickory Smoked Burger with Hickory Smoked Sauce on a Hickory Smoked Bun...which ended up costing me an Andrew Jackson (Old Hickory himself). To be honest, I wasn't looking forward to it. And the thought of fries made me wanna climb a tree and eat something out of it, even bird poo. LET ME JUST SAY IT WAS THE BEST BURGER EVER!!!! The fries actually sucked and I only had 8, but the burger was out of this world. Hickory Sauce was slathered on it. A huge 1/8th head of fresh lettuce added a crisp joie de vivre to every bite. Large cut grilled onions added a whole 'nuther kind of crunchiness. The bun was soft and full of the kind of flour I abhor now which makes things edible, and it was perfect. And how they wrote those babies is a carnivore's version of origami. Let's call it Carnivorigami. That was so good, I'm going to capitalize it CARNIVORIGAMI!!!What a burger. I'm back to my delightfully healthy, restricted diet, but for that 30 minutes, I was in the most delicious portion of Hell. Will never second guess stopping at the Pan again.	1
The bad: parking can be a bit of a pain if you come at the wrong time. They're closed on Mondays (somehow I've been foiled by this on many occasions..). Again, visiting at the wrong time... you'll find yourself waiting for a seat (delaying the deliciousness that you so desperately crave), hoping that everyone is honest and the first-come rule is followed by all. But like all good things, Apple Pan is worth the wait.The good: The burgers, sandwiches, fries, and pies! Oh wait, that's everything on the menu! Years and years ago, when I was just a naive freshman at ucla, I was waiting at the mall to get picked up. I was enjoying some McDonald's fries, when an older gentleman said my fries were trash and said that if I wanted really good food, then next time I'd go across the street to the Apple Pan (this was before the days of yelp, hmmm, I think I've really just dated myself). So I made the effort to go back to the Apple Pan. What a wonderful, life altering decision! The U-shaped counter, old-timey cash register, and old men hustling and bustling around add to the charm. The hickory burger is my favorite and I love the fat fries. No one I've taken here has been disappointed. Lastly, don't forget dessert! There's always room for homemade pie. Apple pie with ice cream?! Yes please! But the pie that changed my life is the boysenberry cream. Don't get me wrong, the banana cream, chocolate, strawberry, etc. are all good and I've ordered many pies to go (for parties and such...no, not just for my own greedy obsession)....but I'll never forget that heavenly boysenberry cream pie.	1
Rooftop bar! Similar to the ambiance at... Villians tavern ( another great place to try in DTLA) , Edison, Cana Rum. Great for dates, friends, visitors.-Great drinks ($11-$13 per drink)-Awesome view especially in the evening-Seating ( couches ) + heaters- I have yet to try the food here, but I will soon!- My friend lives about a block away so we walked here..	1
The best minuta (fish) sandwich in Miami. I have tried a few and this one blew my mind...The fish has great flavor &amp; the tomato , lettuce and onions brings all the flavors together. I decided to stop by &amp; order the sandwich, I am so happy I did....Yummy!!!!!	1
I went to L&#39;Artusi for a friend&#39;s dinner and was in the wine cellar room. The room was nice, but it was freezing in there. We got the pre-fixe dinner, which was $75 per person, excluding drinks, tax, and tip. There was barely enough food for everyone, and the food that I did eat, I didn&#39;t enjoy much. It was EXTREMELY SALTY. The dayboat scallops were good, but the octopus was very bland. The roasted mushrooms were good, but too salty. The olive oil cake was weird and I wouldn&#39;t really consider the cookies as a legitimate &#34;dessert&#34; at a $$$ restaurant. After wine and drinks, the bill came out to be $150 per person, which was not worth it. I&#39;ve had better Italian (or any other type of food) for a lot less.	0
I found this place hunting for any restaurant I could find in this area and let&#39;s just say...it&#39;s just like eating at grandmas...they were so welcoming,attentive, and engaged in conversation with us. The food is authentic (small menu since they are new) and their mole spices are from oaxaca..talk about passion. I was lucky to try the mole and menudo which I can tell was cleaned and cooked properly; the broth was smooth and delicate and the touch of spice gave it that kick. I don&#39;t live in this area but hey it&#39;s like visiting family and enjoying good food..Coming back. Plus, it&#39;s a family running the business....sweet.	1
Nice place, but not that great. Meatballs were super tough. Wine served in little water glasses. Sauce tasted canned. Not worth the price.	0
Main course takes forever. They didn&#39;t give us a good table too. When we told them that we need to close the bill because the main course didn&#39;t come. They just said sorry and brought the bill	0
Tasty tacos and extremely convenient if you live in the neighborhood. Some of their more non-conventional tacos are their best. Big is an awesome dude. Their tacos can be pricey but definitely worthy to check out from time to time.	1
Huge portions, great price, and close to home. If you are looking for seafood, this place is a hit.	1
This would be the second time I eat here and both times I wasn&#39;t disappointed. Great traditional fare, very tasty food and an excellent atmosphere!! Prices were reasonable considering the location... A real winner!	1
The four of us girls came here on a Friday, a little before noon. The place wasn't pack. One side of the restaurant wasn't occupied but we had to shared a big table with a couple.We order 3 xlb, mushroom with veggies and tofu (do not know the name since I didn't order it) and preserved veggies with beancurd. I love the xlb here. It's juicy and small. A basket comes with 10 pieces. And they're inexpensive (less than $6)The mushroom with veggies and tofu did not taste fresh. My friends mother was saying that they used very old tofu.The preserved veggies was something I ordered. It's a bit on the bitter side and is quite tasteless, but that's the simple thing can sometimes taste good.I would have gave them a 5 stars for food, service (fast), etc, but my cup of water came with a crack that leak water all over my side, the place was sort of dirty (I know, I know, hole in the wall, but wait!)..When I asked my girls how they liked the food, my friend said she saw a hair on the xlb but ate it anyways. (I'm telling you, it's that good!) and when we were trying to finish up the preserved veggie plate, I glance at my friend's mom's plate and notice that she still had a lot of greens, only to realized one of the greens...was a worm. So 5 star for the XLB (You really can't find that anywhere) but 1 star for everything else. So I'm going to put 1 star as a warning for other yelpers to look at the food careful before eating!	0
The theme of the dinner joint is good. I mean the theme is based on its history as a rail car. Nothing really original about it. At Late night too many drunk customers fight with everyone. If you like homeless people asking for money the you would like this place	0
Long story short...	0
All I can say is this restaurant is dirty. I got stomachache after the dinner at this particular Daikokuya (I didn&#39;t have anything else after visiting this place). I wouldn&#39;t recommend this one but the other one located at Irvine inside the Marukai Supermarket. That one is cleaner.<br><br>BTW, you would rarely see waitresses smile in this Little Tokyo&#39;s Daikokuya..... I wonder why.....	0
I love this place, the burgers are made perfect. I'm a fan of medium rare and they got it perfect. I tried the cali burger and its just soo good.	1
Where can I start? From the moment you enter the hotel &amp; take the elevator to the 3rd floor you are just transported to a super trendy place with all the elements of a super sophisticated 5 STAR restuarnt. The decor is just amazing with views to 57th &amp; 7ave. The staff were all very welcoming, friendly &amp; well rounded from the coat check person, waiter &amp; manager. I attended dinner with two friends &amp; we all had the same reactions with our meals it was super Delicious; everything was cooked to perfection &amp; lots of sophistication. I have dinned in many fine places around the world/ in the city &amp; honesty The Back Room takes a top spot because everything was just perfect even the way our checks were placed on our table in a leather case with a nice pen &amp; silver plater. I will definitely be retuning to this place with my boyfriend :) this place is a hidden gem in the city!!!!	1
what a pleasant surprise. A few friends and I decided to have a few drinks here and I was immediately greeted with such welcoming service. The bartender, host, and server were all continuously superb all night. <br><br>Since I was waiting for some friends, I snuck over to the bar for a &#34;Steel Magnolia&#34;. Talk about a quality bartender that doesn&#39;t skimp out on your order. The cocktail was balanced, sturdy, and fun. I had two !<br><br>Thereafter, my party arrived and I ordered the Corn Agnolotti. Basically a sweet corn/maize filled ravioli (similar to butternut squash) with a simple sauce. You could smell the sweet butter that gently nestled the pasta, and it was all covered with a foam that was very aesthetically pleasing. However, it usually think of the sea when i have this type of presentation so it was a little confusing. Nonetheless, it was fantastic. <br><br>This was a perfect way to end a Monday and I can&#39;t wait till I get to go again.	1
Not impressed. Prefer Ed&#39;s lobster bar so much more. But the decor in the restaurant is pretty awesome.	0
This joint was created in between two old buildings, the food is interesting plus the ambiance it&#39;s cool with a young crowd	1
Five star ambiance and service, three star food. As a vegetarian, there was not much to eat here besides the cauliflower side, and a few other sides (I didn&#39;t want to overload myself on cheese, since my only choice for main course was the risotto). The risotto turned out to be a super boring plain version of Israeli couscous! Awful! I ate it because it was a special date with my husband and he (meat eater) seemed to be enjoying himself. Unfortunately the only way I&#39;ll be back here is for a drink, and maybe a fresh mozzarella bruschetta while waiting for my table at Bar Corvo (which is always perfect btw!). Also, they could use an improvement on their wines by the glass...and please, more vegetarian/vegan choices?? That would be nice! I&#39;ll be back for sure, just to give it another shot! <br>Ps: the panacotta was outstanding! So, please keep that on the menu, specially for the upcoming warmer Spring and Summer weather.	0
What an awesome addition to the area. Best brunch hands down and I don&#39;t even like brunch. The menu is limited but everything tasted delicious. The ambiance is trendy and hip. Totally worth a visit.	1
Great food. Hotel is cool.	1
Went there on Saturday, new owners, new ways, but am proud to report that the Kimchee is DIVINE! Lorna and I ate the whole pot! Friends had the Kimchee soup which was totally heart and good, I had the seafood soup it was really delicate which means a little on the bland side for my robust Mexican taste. The Noodles hit the spot and even my friends&#39;s 3 month old agreed as she was happily mouthing a noodle. Their wontons looked amazing being rolled behind us and then fried to crispy perfection, Next time as my friends not pork eaters (saddly no veggie ones!) and the soup portion was really huge and plentiful anyway!	1
Heard a lot of hype about this place, decided to give it a try. Hostess was a complete bimbo, had no idea what was going on and asked us how many were in our party a few different times. After waiting for her to seat us for 30 minutes (after she told us we would be seated right away), we decided to sit at the bar for our meal. Drinks were good, but small. Food was bland at best. Tacos were "street tacos" and were priced at $6 a piece - basically same thing you can get from a food truck for a quarter of the price. Basically a fancy scene with outrageous prices for street tacos. $75 bill and we walked out feeling like we barely ate anything. If you have a good appetite, expect to spend $50 per person (food only) - much more than "petty cash". Terrible value for the money - First and last time I will dine here.	0
I've had Kyochon Chicken twice now. Once at a food festival and now at their place on 6th street. I like that it's crispy but the wings are tiny and the Garlic/Soy sauce is a bit too salty for my taste. It's been a couple of hours and I STILL cannot satiate my thirst ... which means they must use MSG or something that makes my throat dry and/or allergic to their food this time. :( If you like that kinda stuff, go for it. My other warning is, it's better to eat there OR call in your order before picking it up. I ordered mine to go at the counter and it took them more than a half an hour to have it done. I saw a few of the servers leave to move their car or something. Made the service even more SLOW. Meanwhile the other guests who came after me and ate there got their food before me. Probably will not come back because I've had WAY BETTER wings AND service elsewhere. Bring on sports and wings!	0
I ordered a truffle burger and a manly burger. The truffle burger was the best burger I have ever tasted and the manly burger was great as well.	1
Overpriced, &#34;creatively bland food&#34; . Lots of exotic ingredients which didn&#39;t add up to much flavor. My friend and I were encouraged by our charming waitress to order two dishes each because they&#39;re supposed to be small. We definitely could have gotten one dish each and shared. But why would you share food which is a chore to eat? The bland, single-flavored food is supposed to be made exotic by pronouncing the names of the dishes with some pseudo-European accent. <br><br>My Fava bean and chick-pea dish tasted only like pepper flakes and the flatbread (called a &#39;caco&#39;) had way too many unflavorful anchovies on it. Just because it&#39;s the end of the night and you have a day&#39;s worth of anchovies left over doesn&#39;t mean you should pile them on to an uninteresting dish. I ordered a &#34;shrub&#34; or &#34;shrug&#34; or &#34;schlub&#34; ? I couldn&#39;t understand the &#39;fancy&#39; pronunciation of a soda which takes like balsamic vinegar with a small amount of other flavor.<br><br>Trying to combine a lot of strange ingredients together and covering the resultant bland mess with an affected name and pronunciation doesn&#39;t result in something you&#39;d want to eat. I know. I&#39;ve tried it at home and now I use recipes. Of course my review is also colored by the fact that attempted to eat the leftovers (i paid a lot of money for them) and nearly choked to death on some super dry chickpea. My cat refused the anchovy I offered her. I&#39;ve raised her well. She recognizes bad food wrapped in a Cirque du Soleil package too.	0
We had a great anniversary dinner. Our server, Paxton, was absolutely wonderful and very knowledgable of the menu! What was so cool was the building. The stable that housed many great racing horses was beautifully refurbished into a beautiful venue. Such a great time and I would highly recommend this to anyone in the area looking for a delicious meal. One of the best Ruth's Chris I have ever been to!	0
$3 mimosas. Laid back vibe. Lactaid pills upon arrival for those of us who love the cheese, but need some support. Definitely a great place to hang on a Sunday to enjoy the open atmosphere and giggles galore.	1
Yum Yum Yummy!	1
One of the best Pizza's in LA. Breakfast is really great (French Toast is divine). Servers are always friendly, laid back and really know their stuff. Hostess this Sunday was so nice. Helped accommodate us with two kids and a dog during brunch rush. Even brought water for our pouch. Best spot in Los Feliz. Only one small gripe: was had to pay for refill on ice tea after getting an Arnold Palmer. Make reservations. This spot is always jammed.	1
Personnally i love their burritos... That&#39;s pretty much my main thing there, i don&#39;t really like chips.. My wife really enjoy them thoughspecially with the guacamole. The service isnt always good and one of the guy should really learn how to close the burrito correctly... I&#39;m happy they are going to open one on 107 ave and 88st soon... Closer !!	1
Wow. It&#39;s really hard to add to the impressive reviews already on this Yelp page, but I&#39;ll try.<br><br>Like other reviews have pointed out, this is a real deal Japanese restaurant. The wife and I didn&#39;t have a chance to talk with the chef, but the wait staff was super friendly and very attentive and quick with the refills.<br><br>We ordered the following:<br>- Baby squid - three total, served in a bowl with miso and seaweed.<br>- Black pork tonkatsu - classic tonkatsu, executed without flaw<br>- Sweet shrimp sashimi - six total, drizzled in a basil infused olive oil.<br>- Sashimi salad - yellow tail, tuna and salmon in mixed baby greens<br>- agedashi tofu - 100% home made, excellent broth, and I was amazed at how crisp the outside stayed considering it was soaking in warm broth.<br>- shrimp &amp; veggie tempura - another Japanese restaurant staple executed without flaw<br><br>Normally I would go into more detail, but other reviews do a much better job than I ever could and each dish was just fantastic . We are already planning on trying their private dining room multi-course dinners (Kaiseki)<br><br>The only draw back is that as off a few days ago they were still waiting on their liquor license.	1
I&#39;ve been exposed to legit Mongolian food a few times last year (anybody thinking the cheesy AYCE build-it-yourself noodle gimmicks around town are real are fooling themselves) and decided to give this place a try. I went in during a quiet spell, but got a good vibe from everything.<br><br>Restaurant is clean and the tables are big/comfortable. My waitress was diligent and very polite. We chatted a bit about some local Mongolian community members and the boss and other guy working the restaurant knew who I was talking about. As I understand it, a lot of the Mongolian community lives in KTown, so it didn&#39;t surprise me that we had some friends in common. <br><br>The menu is simple, but for a place that just opened, that&#39;s not shocking. I had the beef dumplings (&#34;buuz&#34;), which were as good as the homemade ones I was introduced to last year. I also tried the shredded beef noodles (&#34;Tsuivan&#34;), which were very clean and fresh - not overcooked or oversauced. Both were very filling (expect big portions with this place) and delicious. <br><br>Prices are very reasonable, with salads as low as $4.00 and the most expensive entree at $17.00. Most of the dishes are based around noodle soups and dumpling-related entrees. <br><br>Mongolian food is milder, and not strong in spice or sauce flavor. Don&#39;t expect the spicy kick of Korean kim chi or Szechwan hot pot. But the portion size won&#39;t leave you hungry, and given what the weather can be like in Mongolia + that food is to fuel the body, I expect this be a fantastic place especially for (the few) cold, rainy days in LA. <br><br>I also expect this to become a regular haunt for me.	1
Considering the name of this place I came in here thinking that this was going to be a theme bar with a bunch of books. Possibly ones that you could look at. When I asked the bartender if they had a collection of books, he replied that they are a &#34;library of whiskey,&#34; I meekly laughed and responded with &#34;haha, that makes sense.&#34; Well I&#39;ve done some thinking and I have decided that no, it didn&#39;t make sense. First of all, I was not informed of any way that you could sign up for a system where you could check out whiskey and then return it a few days later. Really, isn&#39;t that the backbone of what a library is? Secondly, there did not seem to be an especially large collection of whiskey. If you were going to go to a whiskey library, wouldn&#39;t you expect an impressive collection? Anyways, as a bar the place was pretty good. The food looked good and I considered taking someone else&#39;s when they used the restroom but I eventually pussed out. I suppose I would recommend the establishment as a bar but most certainly not as a bookstore or whiskey library.	1
Ehhh. Patio used to be dog friendly. Anyway walked in with my dog and no one told us dogs are not allowed. So we sat there for 15 mins and even saw the manager and host but didn&#39;t say a thing. The waiters were walking by us and no one said a thing. Uhhhm. Still sitting and waiting then when we were about to walk out a waiter said, &#34;Sorry! We don&#39;t allow dogs here anymore.&#34; Uhh ok?! Thanks for letting us know 3 years later? Anyway, I thought that was rude and unprofessional. How about put a f*cking sign that says NO DOGS ALLOWED? This is not rocket science. Never going back to this place ever even if they have good cocktails.	0
I like the a lot. Good food and amount for 25$. You have choice of steak fritte or salmon. Come with second serving. Comes with soup or salad. Service was great. Very friendly. They serve only beer and wine.	1
I wish there was more than one waiter. He was great but by serving as waiter and bartender he couldn't give adequate service to the tables.	0
Great restaurant overall, but to get the most bang for your buck, you have to come during lunch hours. Their lunch specials are great. Just about all of their popular dishes are on special. $7.99 for skirt steak, sweetbreads, sandwiches, etc.<br><br>I&#39;ve had their churrasco. It&#39;s always cooked the customer&#39;s way, and wonderfully seasoned.<br><br>My faovrite are the sweetbreads. They&#39;re grilled wonderfully and have a nice char. Squeeze some lemon over it, and you&#39;ll be in sweetbread heaven.<br><br>Their Choripan is good. Just chorizo in bread, but it&#39;s great.<br><br>Last time I tried their Sandwich de Matambre. Awesome! It&#39;s basically a ham roll that is stuffed with veggies and hard boiled eggs. Very good.<br><br>All these lunch specials come with fries, salad, and rice. Get stuffed for $7.99? Good deal.	1

Salad out of a bag and stale bread!!!	0
BAD service!!! We've been here twice now. First time was a busy Sunday night & second time was a relatively slow week night. Each time, the waiters working the tables and behind the bar were rude, inattentive, and appeared annoyed & put upon when asked for help (i.e. when asked to do their job). The bus boys, on the other hand, were friendly, polite, & very helpful and efficient. The food we ordered was good, but given the service, we don't think this place will be near the top of our list next time we decide to go out for dinner. Too bad, given how close this place is to our house.	0
I love Olive Garden, love pasta, love italian food.. <br><br>But this place makes me hate Olive Garden. :| <br>Makes me want to chug the jug of Sangeria just to deal with being here. <br><br>I hate that there is so few locations down south because this place really annoys me. The hostess I&#39;ve always encountered are not that polite, I&#39;ve always had poor customer service and had to wait for my food longer than expected. Food comes out wrong or horribly bland. <br>I don&#39;t know.. Maybe there&#39;s a curse on me &amp; my table when i come here but it&#39;s not ever working out between us!	0
It's not a crime to like this place. The food isn't so bad (not amazing, either...), but the service is good, they have decent hours, and vegetarion food. And milkshakes.	1
Service by Herme was the outstanding memory of our visit. No she crab soup in Baltimore? Unheard of.....note to Diamond Tavern, tourists want CRAB anything, thank you. Average for hotel restaurant food. Good outdoor view of Camden Yards.	0
This is the place to go to have a few drinks and have a conversation with friends or significant other.The beer selection is amazing and the cocktails will not disappoint. I always order some California rolls to go with my beer.	1
Great little local hole in the wall. Ruben sandwich was superb. Cuban sandwich pretty good. Place is eclectic- just the way it ought to be.	1
Been frequenting this place for at least 5-6 years. It's a very cute bar nestled in Little Tokyo. Their drinks/food/service are all decent (i.e., no complaints) -- but the 4th star is for their outdoor area. I'm a sucker for ambiance and hanging twinkle lights -- ergo, I love grabbing drinks with friends when I'm in the Little Tokyo area. I've never had to wait for a seat, so it's the perfect spot to drop-in on a whim.Case in point: The wait times for the ramen joint a few doors down is INSANE IN THE MEMBRANE (unreal) -- so we usually stroll on over to The Far Bar to kill time.	1
We bumped into this place at Tivoli village farmers market and were blown away first - by their service, then by the food! Their new crispy chicken sandwich was amazing. Better than real chicken! So fresh and good. Can&#39;t wait for them to open up all over Vegas!	1
TRUFFLE BURGER AND TRUFFLE FRIES FTW!!Tried the Hatch burger this time, and it was awesome as well! But I think I still prefer the truffle burger!Love this location because it has indoor and patio seating and it's much bigger! Also serves alcohol= :)Server was amazing!	1
Although it looks attractive inside and out, the food wasn&#39;t so great. All-American burger joint, but it was too safe for taste and dry for a burger. I liked the unlimited nacho cheese machine tho! Great place for kids I assume since it has games and arcade sections. They have shakes too :)	0
I relied on yelp reviews and made a trip to this place all the way from Las Vegas strip.. It&#39;s not that far.. It took me just 10 mins by cab ($16).. I came in for lunch buffet and I didn&#39;t like what I saw so I asked if I can order ala carte but sadly that don&#39;t allow that. I arrive bit early and the food labels on the buffet were wrong. Samosa was good and so was the naan but rest of the stuff was disappointing. I would not recommend this place to anyone.	0
When they first opened they were pretty good, and I used to order from them all the time. They then switched chefs and now they are terrible.	0
The Food is absolutely Delicious!!!! I&#39;ve known the Owner Sal for over 10 years, he has always provided the BEST Quality Service to all his customers. The food is always fresh and they have by far the most delicious bagels. I highly recommend Theresa&#39;s Place to everyone.	1
Customer service is not on their priority list. The person who took my order was having a conversation while trying to take my order. It was very rude and probably the reason I found egg in my order after specifically telling her I was allergic to them and when I called back, they simply left me holding for ten minutes. What a Joke!	0
I was super stoked to finally Los Tacos No. 1, thinking they would be one of the best tacos I&#39;ve ever had. I was saving my stomach for a lobster roll so I only tried the pollo. It tasted just like another taco... I think I&#39;ve had better tacos off of taco trucks and at restaurants, plus it was it was sort of pricey for one taco.	0
The food is consistently good. The burger has a nice char on it. I love the grilled cheese. The drinks kinda suck - gotta be honest with ya. Stick to beer or wine, or something easy to mix. Love the outdoor patio with the pups - they're always very gracious to our well behaved pups.	1
15% off for locals with card .. . good idea.  $14 margaritas seemed excessive (if one were to drink more than one or two).	1
I don't think I'll ever go back or recommend the 5 Point Cafe. The service was ridiculously slow. It took almost 2 hours to get an appetizer and 2 burgers. The kicker was we watched groups sit down after us eat and leave before we even received our food. I never received a refill on my water during this entire time. When we finally received our food my burger tasted freezer burnt and it wasn't cooked thru. I don't mind medium cooked meat but this tasted like raw meat. To top it all off after telling the waitress of our disappointment in the meal the waitress just didn't seem to care. It's definitely a tourist trap where the business model is not based on quality but on making as much money as possible--the evidence is in our $60 bill.	0
They do an amazing Chicken Prego sandwich. And try the cured duck bacon too! Good atmosphere, great place, excellent food.	1
I enjoy bacon and coffee. I also like eggs every now and then. Toast, too. I like this place because the service is fast, the food is always what you want, and the people are friendly.<br><br>Breakfast reigns supreme here, but don&#39;t come in asking for something fancy and weird.	1
Small &amp; elegant space off W 29th. The white-beige minimal decor softly glowing w fairy lights and playing 70s tunes &amp; smooth jazz was the appeal for me, frankly. I was done w hipsters, craft shots and midtown mediocrity. Simple, lean japanese lunch menu, teas and some cakes and cookies, serving Paromi teas. Friendly counter service. Would have given 5 stars if they had ceramic tea pot and cups.	1
Try this one if you're in Annapolis.  Take your Mid here . . . it will be a real treat!	0
I used to come here all the time before I had my baby. For the first time in a LONG time I was finally able to get out of the house. Of course I picked my old favorite Farmer Brown!!!! I was SO disappointed because they no longer serve their gumbo. I wanted to cry. I guess I will never be going back there again.	0
This restaurant was amazing and surprisingly not overly priced!  Get the house vegetable fried rice...TO DIE FOR!  The lamb dumplings were also amazing!  The cocktail menu is extensive and they also have seasonal drinks.  Smaller plates allow you to order more food as a group and share it.  It was a great experience overall!	1
Perfect ratio's of crust sauce and topping are king.....and the BBP has this down pat. Amazing flavors even on the lowly plain cheese pizza. Very thin crust that is still quite tender at it's core.	1
Okay, before I really review this place, can someone tell me what's up with the location? I mean, maybe there are things around and I'm just not really familiar with the area but it felt like it was in the middle of nowhere downtown LA? Like I said, maybe I just don't know that area too well and it's actually pretty close to stuff but from the freeway exits that we took to and from, it seem like there was nothing around expect warehouses and closed business. Regardless, I'm thankful to Unique Eats and the Cooking Channel for turning me onto this place and even though the one item I really wanted to try (the pig ears) weren't on the menu the evening we went, I'm still very impressed with this place. Additional props to this place for having awesome French food in a very casual and relaxed atmosphere. Only minor complaint would be that the noise level was kinda high, even though the place wasn't packed the night we went. Now, onto the food... Since there were only 3 of us, I didn't get to order the whole mean (this time) but we ordered a lot of the smaller dishes to share, which is the way I really enjoy dining... family style. Sorry, can't deny my Asian roots. So we started with this pulled pork like thing that came in a jar (oh and yeah, I'm not going to be able to provide names of a lot of the dishes since they were in French and the only thing I remember from HS French class is "je n'parle pas francise") but that was very good. The best way I could describe it was that it was like pulled pork on crack. The next dish that came out that blew my mind were the escargots. Very mild in flavor but still very rich and I like the twist with the puff pastry. Those two dishes I would definitely get again. Next we had the pig feet and while it was still good, I'm not sure I'd get that dish again. It was a little gamy, which is fine since I don't mind that but not sure what it was about that dish. It just didn't quite do it for me. After that, we had the asparagus (which to my surprise were really good) and the flam-bay, which was the thin almost cracker like thing with the caramelized onion and bacon on top. That was probably my favorite of the evening. I mean, something so simple yet so good. I was actually sad that we left one piece since I was way too full and gone are the days where I stuff myself to the point of no return. The last dish was the bone marrow and while it was good, I can honestly said, I've had better. Again, not sure I'd order that dish again either. The dessert we had were the lemon one and their best seller which was this chocolate mouse like cup with house-made cookies and chocolate shavings on top. Both were a great way to finish off the meal. Service was great since every time I drank some water, it felt like it was being refilled immediately. Overall, the price was about $80/person which included tip and the sharing of a bottle of wine. Would definitely return to try more!!!	1
The best compliment I can give this place or any place with the atmosphere that Little Dom&#39;s has is that it reminds me of being in the North Beach neighborhood of San Francisco. Little Dom&#39;s would be totally at home as one of the corner restaurants in Washington Square. Being that SF is my hometown, this is a high rating of comparison for me. I like the small bar so you can grab a drink before dinner while waiting to be seated. I also like the coat rack at the entrance for those &#34;cold&#34; Los Feliz nights... Hahah. I like the butcher&#39;s paper on the tables. It&#39;s a neighborhood Italian joint. A damn good one... I remember when this was the old La Belle Epoque space back in the day.<br><br>We were seated out in the heated outdoor patio. Those heaters worked so good we had to ask our server to turn off the one directly above us. My group of 4 opted for the rice balls ($9) &amp; fried potatoes ($8) for appetizers. Let me start with the surprisingly good rice balls. You have a large meatball sized risotto/parmesan pan-fried until the outside is cooked &amp; crispy goodness of a rice ball. And when you cut into it, more cheesy goodness is revealed. Yay!.. The fried potatoes were so so GOOD. How do they make that? I cant describe it... I&#39;ve tried to explain to other people but I couldn&#39;t. I ended up telling them that they just need to order it... There&#39;s crispy, there&#39;s moist, there&#39;s tangy, there&#39;s salty, there&#39;s sour... I was confused, in the best way possible. Def ordering that again.<br><br>I ordered the pizza ($11). All their pizzas are basically margherita pizzas that you can add to... The toppings I chose were prosciutto ($3) &amp; egg ($2). They were great choices, if I do say so myself... Good sized pie (not round,not square) served on what looks like a wooden cutting board. The crust was just right. Crispy but not too thin. The toppings were all fresh &amp; flavor in your ear. The egg is what made it over the top.... The pizza was delish.<br><br>I also had some of my friend&#39;s spaghetti &amp; meatballs ($15). It was good. The pasta was al dente &amp; came with 2 sizeable meatballs. Good stuff.<br><br>Our desserts were the cannoli trio ($8) &amp; the brioche bread pudding ($8). Both were good. The cannolis were: pistachio, lemon &amp; ricotta. The pistachio one was my favorite of the three. The bread pudding was the winner. Very tasty. The apples &amp; the gelato it was served with were perfect compliments. I highly recommend it.<br><br>Thank you, Little Dom&#39;s... You took me back to San Francisco. Be back soon to tackle the rest of the menu.	1
Wish I could rate zero.<br>They didn&#39;t let me in with my child&#39;s stroller. <br>Unheard of.<br><br>They have lost me as a customer. I felt discriminated. Their seating has plenty of room for my wife and child.	0
Good place for groups because it's fun to share the tapas and it's loud and festive. i wouldn't suggest it for someone who's hard-of-hearing or has difficulty reading in dim light because it's very dark, too. I'd recommend the lamb meatballs and the margarita pizza: those were the best of the many tapas we tried.	1
The new Oinkster in Hollywood is the exact same food as their other location. Awesome pastrami and pulled pork sammi's and huge killer burger and much eaiser a treck than the eagle-rock location!!!!D.D.D.....D.D.D.	1
Had a ramen fix after a night out of heavy drinking. I have to say that this ramen hit the spot! The place itself is small, but does not detract away from it's ambience. I ordered a spicy miso ramen and it was absolutely delicious! They also serve in large portions! which was quite a pleasant surprise! For 12 dollars you can order a combo meal which includes a variety of add-on sides to your ramen bowl including sushi/ tuna sashimi/ etc. I would highly recommend this place to others and would definitely be coming here again!	1
As a sister to the Shanghai Garden in the International District this fine restaurant has great menu options and the food is consistently good. Of course the hand-shaved noodles are a treat and you can get them stir-fried or in soup. Delicious! The overly pink decor is pure americana...but the big aquariums will keep the kids entertained.	1
I tried this place one time and it was alright. I figured I would give it a second try and I regret it. The food is not fresh and tastes mediocre. I went with my boyfriend and he now has food poisoning from the burrito he had. I tried to get in contact with the company but they don&#39;t even have a website. Definitely will not return to this place. I&#39;ll stick with Chipotle.	0
Very disappointing as breakfest is great but dinner not so much had lasagna no cheese just a couple large noodles and meat also turkey dinner witch was fair but never had fatty turkey before oh well	0
I don't know where to begin... 1. Umami just cured my hangover, Thank you!2. I'm vegetarian and I love the Umami with portobello 3. Rarely do I find food that I like to savor.	1
Best burger I've had in my life!	1
Beyond awesome for flavor and fresh ingredients! Luan the owner is friendly worldly and knows his stuff when it comes to wood fired pizza! Oh yea!	1
The scallops were sooooo good!  My client ordered the filet and he said it was great.  I felt they did a good job on portion size.  Many times when you go to a high scale restaurant I feel like you don't get what you pay for (small portions with high prices).  My client and I left feeling very full and satisfied with a delicious meal!	1
Not going to lie. I had avoided this place ever since moving to LA because I thought it was just another one of those FLOOFY/UPPITY/HOITY TOITY restaurants, that are EXTREMELY over rated. However, when I was invited to lunch at this spot (on them, not me) I couldn't say no. Free food is free food, RIGHT?!Valet Parking = $6**Now this is slightly over-priced, however this place is always jam packed, which means all the metered parking is TAKEN. Oh and the parking in the residential areas is confusing as shit to figure out, so really $6 is far cheaper than the $60 ticket you risk getting.So I like to eat. I really like to eat. And I eat A LOT. When I ordered my chicken chop salad (chicken and grilled vegetables chopped up) I asked them how much chicken is actually on the salad - there is nothing I hate MORE than a bowl full of greens with a tiny cube of chicken **Ahem, Bar Bouchon in Beverly Hills** - The waiter told me there was a fare amount, however, he did say that they could put another portion of chicken on there if I wanted. When telling me this though, he of course looked at me like, "yeah right, you cannot eat all of that, you are such a little girl" - Well prepare to be amazed MISTER! "LOAD ME UP WITH THE SECOND PORTION OF CHICKEN" - I replied CONFIDENTLY!My dining companion on the other hand, not a big eater, order the same salad but the way it is listed on the menu. (Oh there was someone else with us, he got the sliders - loved them).When our salads arrived, hers was on a plate, mine was in a trough okay, not really... it was in a bowl. The portion was pretty big, but I must say that I am thrilled I ordered extra chicken, because the two portions together were about 7 ounces or so... Just enough to fill me up for lunch. And if you don't know me, I get pregnancy cravings for chicken so I need A LOT - and no I am not even pregnant. I of course licked my bowl clean. Yep, I keep it classy. And the waiter was very impressed with my hoovering skills. Oh wait, I haven't even mentioned if the salad was good. Well, it was, hence me eating the whole thing - however, when I am hungry I will devour pretty much anything - the grilled diced up vegetables added subtle flavor and the chicken was grilled and sliced to perfection, I didn't even need a dressing. Yes, this place is definitely FLOOFY but at least it serves up some pretty tasty grub. Will I come back? Sure... However, I probably won't be the one recommending it as I do know far yummier places.	1
Just found a large piece of glass in my burger. By "found" I mean I bit down very hard on a LARGE PIECE OF GLASS in my burger. I may not be leaving this review right now if it weren't for the incompetent management we dealt with after the incident. Eric, the manager, was extremely rude to us when we returned 3 of the 4 burgers. This was a takeout order and one of us finished our burger first, however we all stopped eating after we all heard what sounded like my tooth breaking in half. When we tried to get our money back, they asked us where the other burger was. Whoa, excuse me sir, we found glass in our food... Should there be any discussion involved? They're lucky that all we wanted was to return our remaining food and get our money back. Horrific. #glassfedbeef	0
This is the spotttttt! Me and my friend go here all the time they have bomb ass food and their fries are amazing. Can't complain one bit about the customer service cuz they're always talking to you and making jokes as they take your order! Takes about 10 minutes to get ur food I totally Recommend this place to anyone out in Hollywood! Try out their chicken tacos while you're there! Shout out to mike and his "amazing" comedy :D	1
The chicken chipotle wrap is fantastic. The entire menu looks great. Fresh ingredients...and fantastic home made chips. Love 'em!!!!	1
Too much hype for a so-so dinner. Cool spot with awesome ambiance. The pizza is ok, nothing special. And the pasta plates aren't nearly big enough to feed any average adult. I was not impressed at all.	0
I&#39;m just gonna be upfront about it. I like the sauce better at Boiling Crab. But I like this place more than Boiling Crab for numerous reasons: <br>1. They&#39;re open late, which is great cuz I eat dinner late all the time. <br>2. The wait time is pretty much nonexistent for now since they just opened but the space for this place is huge so I&#39;m sure wait times will be less than Boiling Crab in the future. <br>3. Super extensive menu, from oysters to pasta to fried foods!!! <br>4. They have combo packages, which include shrimp, clams, Dungeness crab, potatoes, sausages, and corn!! Makes it super easy to order. <br>5. Oysters for dayyyyyys. I love oysters and they have a good variety here. We ordered the hama hama oysters cuz they were out of kumamoto. They were served fresh and cold. <br><br>We ordered a gang of food for four people: dozen oysters, 1 lb of king crab legs, redondo combo, extra 1 lb of shrimp and 1 lb of clams, Cajun fries, and garlic fries. Everything was gooooood. I think this place is gonna do well but it needs more word of mouth advertisement for sure. Holy crab definitely reminds me of both Boiling Crab and EMC.<br><br>Can&#39;t wait to return!	1
My family ordered Pizza and was great. I ordered a Calzone and was the worst I have had so far. It was not cook at all. Probably was only 2 minutes in the oven and it took 20 minutes to be served. I will come back again but no calzone please	0
Had fun here, the food was GREAT I got the salmon that came with those little black things that looked like beans they tasted AMAZING!. The portion wasn&#39;t huge but it the taste made it up. The place has nice decor a very hip place and huge crowd here. Our table was literally next to other people&#39;s table, which kinda sucks a little since you can hear other people&#39;s conversation. The bar was FILLED with people, my guess is they were waiting for a table. Definitely a place I will come back soon to. I had a great experience and the paintings they had up was cool (Some kind of huge catoonish robot thing). <br><br>Pizza is a must try and their salmon.	1
Then you will love CL. My in-laws are Chinese and even they love it. Nice dining room, bar, happy hour and all the dishes I've tried are quite delicious. Get the table-side made guacamole, excellent. They also have a cheese soup like appetizer that is especially good with chips. Mucho gusto.	1
The staples of a good Mexican meal are simple good chips, flavorful salsa, beans and rice. Although they have nice crunchy chips the other three pillars are missing the mark.  The meats have one flavor- salt... Oh and dry. They were out of guac on a Saturday during lunch... That's just wrong! The staff however is delightfully charming but not enough to make up for a lack of guacamole! Location is convenient but the food is not enough to bring me back for more. I'm more of an authentic Mexican food lover than what Cucos has to offer. If you like bland and salty this is the joint for you.	0
I always see such long lines outside this place when I pass by on weekends for brunch. I've also heard that a couple of movies/tv shows were filmed here before. So giving in to hollywood's social conformism, I decided to give the place a try. And with a restaurant named toast, I decided it would be best to have their brunch. Now I was prepared for a little wait, but 30 minutes to wait in line for brunch? And the server was kinda pushy. Wasn't sure if it was the fact that we didn't order too much or that she'd rather get through with us and get another table in. Whatever it was, I really hate being rushed through my meal. I'm here to enjoy lunch, not to make sure she earns enough tips for the day. The food was ok, I guess. My salad was pretty good but my bf's sandwich was a bit dry. And there it is, another overly hyped restaurant.	0
How could I forgot this place already? I've always driven by it and I've always wanted to go, never got to there after all these years. After my friend wad denied at Lucky Strike for being, well, "large", we passed by it on the way to the Golden Gopher and vowed to stop by after.Sure enough, we got there at 2 AM and were standing in line what looked like persian acrobats and medieval gnomes. It was pretty funny, and I don't think they all knew each other.Anyways, although it did take us a while to sit down, once we sat down and they took our order, holy crap, 5 minutes later, we all had our meals. I was impressed with the speed of the service. Great place to eat after hours to sober up! Also remember - CASH ONLY - but they do have an ATM inside.For Goldline Riders: Since the gold line ends at midnight, and doesn't start up again until 3:40 AM - you can stay here pretty much until it's time to get on the train - granted you'd probably want to take a cab to get to union (about $8) because the red line doesn't start until 5AM. I know, it makes no sense the lines work that way.	1
Great new restaurant--welcome to the neighborhood!! Lots of farm fresh options, hangar steak was delicious. Will definitely be back to explore the menu!	1
Came here for Valentine&#39;s Day dinner. The place is really small, almost a hole in the wall bar with a few tables. The waiting/entrance area is a 3 feet by 3 feet square hidden behind curtains, where we waited for maybe 5 minutes wondering if someone knew we were there. After poking our heads through the curtains a few times and getting awkward looks from people dining, we were finally seated.<br><br>We had reservations and were fortunate enough to be able to move it back a half hour on a stressful day, so bonus points for that. Customer service at the restaurant itself was prompt and friendly, the waitress was friendly, knowledgeable and on task. <br><br>The food was great - I couldn&#39;t stop eating. I was REALLY looking forward to the ube waffles and fried chicken and the spam fries. The spam fries were great - but this is coming from a spam eater. My date was not a spam fan and did not appreciate it as much. The fried chicken was great - the ube waffles on the other hand were definitely hard like another reviewer stated... it would have been perfect if the waffles had been softer instead of them being more crunchy. Did not understand if this is their way of cooking waffles or they continuously overcook them. <br><br>So, the food was good and tasty except for the waffles. Drinks were expensive for what they were. <br><br>Another note - prior to this, I had tried contacting the restaurant a few times, by email, twitter, phone calls. Email took a while to respond, twitter did not respond at all, and when I called, I was unable to speak to a manager... was told &#34;Well, you&#39;ll just get told what I just told you&#34;. Whoever answers the phones needs to get sent to customer interaction training. Tried reaching out to the General Manager through various outlets and to this day did not get any response. I would understand if I was reaching out to Gordon Ramsey or Emeril, but this is not a 5-star restaurant with a big name attached to it - you are not too good and above everyone else to answer customer&#39;s questions or concerns. <br><br>Overall, I wanted so much more out of this place in terms of food and customer service, and they did not match to the standards I thought I could hold them up to. I would recommend this place if you do not mind taking a chance on customer service and overcooked food, but if somehow everything works out, it is not a terrible place to eat. However, you can find better food for cheaper prices in NYC.	0
Great service and food is always fresh. It&#39;s very clean and Reggie plus staff is super helpful, they go above and beyond every time.	1
We were disappointed with the food, and how long it took to get it. It might be different inside, but it took an awfully long time to get our burgers, rings, and slaw when it wasn't very crowded out there. Good quality meat, but burgers seemed under seasoned (husband barely ate his), and we never got our slaw. Rings good. Nice view of gondolas (closed now), and Las Vegas Blvd if you sit close to street. Server nice, but busy. We wouldn't go back.	1

Hidden Gem. Great Mexican food. Definitely better than Robertos and Don Tortaco. Get a car wash, gas, and a California burrito	1
The name is misleading...	1
Place was great...kind of empty for valentines but it was great overall. The nightclub was awesome and DJ was great. Will definitely go back to visit.	0
Food was on par with any medium level Italian restaurant, but the hype about their enormous portions is just that; hype!  While most people would consider the salad and pastas to be oversize  portions, their entrees and desserts were about average, given the price point they charge for them.	1
After trying several other Chinese-style restaurants in Madison, I have to say for the price this is as good as it gets. There are other places that might have more authentic options and style, but they tend to be pricier with not much value added. Tai's Asian Bistro is a bit more modern than traditional, but it totally gets street cred for the sticky tables and consistently hard-working staff.	0
This was my first time but definitely not my last! The place is small and intimate and the food is AMAZING. Very modern twist on the dishes and everything is delicious. I had the spare rib, quinoa salad, and mushroom tart. The cook even comes out to greet you!	1
I&#39;m not sure what happened. We went one week and the menu and place seemed great. The Holiday Inn opened next to it and now they are serving the Holiday Inn menu??? Literally, the Holiday Inn menu with the branding and everything. No clue what happened, but I won&#39;t be going back. The food was terrible and none of the same nice people were there. Too bad too because it&#39;s such a cool looking place right across the street from me.	0
The burgers here are just your normal run of the mill burgers (bun, meat, cheese, lettuce, pickles, and sauce) but they're pretty good. The menu is concise; there's nothing fancy or out of the ordinary to order. I think I saw a turkey sandwich and egg salad sandwich or something but if you come here, why even think about ordering something besides the burgers.The only thing that confused me were the prices. $6.50 for a burger + $.50 if you want cheese. Fries? Like $2.50 more. Just ridiculous for what you can buy at In-n-Out for half the price. Yes. It's pretty much like In-n-Out.If you're still going to come to this place, here's some advice. Seat your self even if there's trash sitting on the counter. We wandered around confused for a couple minutes not knowing what we should do. Thanks for not telling us to just have a seat.Two stars because it's good and all, but I'll never come here again or recommend it.	0
Cold, overly doughy, and just all around disappointing. Glad the prices were reasonable so I didn&#39;t waste my money on this place. I will, however, never get that $4 back.	0
I feel like every time I go by here, it's packed, so we decided to stop by on an evening when it didn't look too crowded (maybe because it was somewhat early). The service was friendly but we had a little bit of a communication issue - nothing that turned out to be problematic, though. We wanted to try a range of the menu, so we ordered the fried chicken appetizer, spicy chicken, and bibimbop, which we were warned (rightly so) was too much food for 2 people. The appetizer ended up being our favorite item. The main chicken dish seemed bland and nondescript, and the bibimbop depressingly came in a cold dish, making it pretty unexciting. I'm worried that I just ordered the dish incorrectly and missed asking for a hot pot. Clearly I may have been missing something, and it IS open late, but despite its proximity we won't be back.	0
Small but well run Italian restaurant with authentic (not like Chef Boyardee can food) sauces and dishes. The 4 course fixed price meal is a real bargain. The wine list has wonderful Italian wines at a reasonable price.	0
New York City is an incredibly small town. I was on my way to my favorite restaurant one weekend when I stumbled upon B4. We perused the menu and, although we found it interesting, we continued on our way. Fast forward a few weeks, and a friend of ours was having a party there. <br><br>Appetizers (B4&#39;s) - Sesame Seared Ahi Tuna Nachos w/ Napa Slaw &amp; Wasabi Mayo - I was incredibly excited about this based on prior experiences at other restaurants. Sadly, it really let me down at B4. The ahi tuna was on a greasy wonton-like nacho...definitely not a nacho. Also, the slaw is more like garnish.<br><br>Entrees (During-s) - Sage Roasted Chicken on Popcorn Polenta &amp; Rhubarb Chutney - The chicken was insipid. I needed the chutney to flavor the chicken, but there was not enough chutney to do the job. Perhaps the chicken skin had the flavor, but I don&#39;t eat chicken skin, just the meat. The polenta was lacking in flavor as well, big let down. The star here was the chutney, and with protein driving up the price of the plate that&#39;s not good.<br><br>(Drink-s) - Blackberry Mojito - I love mojitos, and I can truly appreciate a well done mojito. At B4, they give it a spin and put blackberry in it. I especially loved the mint leaves and 2 blackberries they put in it. The two ingredients gave the drink a lovely sweet aftertaste and added a nice hint of fruit. I loved the cocktail, and frankly that drink got me through the evenings menu. <br><br>Heads up: My girlfriend ordered the Seared Salmon w/ Israeli Couscous &amp; Feta Salad. Her salmon was cooked well, and the serving size was acceptable. The problem was that they gave her probably a table spoon of couscous and the salad never showed up....unless the garnish on her salmon was the salad.<br><br>Bottom Line: Skip this place.	0
Menu looked interesting and it was literally across the street from my hotel. We walked inside and were told to find our own seats and that someone would wait on us. After 15 minutes we get told &#34;Oh, there&#39;s not too many people working tonight, so if you want food, go over to the bar and order it and watch for when its reday so you can pick it up&#34;<br><br>Eat a dick and die.	0
Service was extremely slow, even after the manager spoke with us about the 40 minute wait for an appetizer. Fried chicken was very good.	1

Like a rollercoaster they're over entirely too quickly. More food needed for this price!	1
The service here is amazing. Carlos and Carina are so polite and Always willing to help. The food is delicious and I will continue to come back and enjoy this wonderful atmosphere with the wonderful people	1
Great happy hour(s). The carne asada and eggs on happy hour is great during the breakfast happy hour. Plus who knew a margarita at 10am would be as good as one served at 10pm. Win win.	1
Oh how the decent have fallen. What used to be a fun restaurant with good food and ok service is now a total mess. <br><br>I&#39;ll call it the groupon effect. They live up to the expectation that a restaurant can&#39;t continually market itself as half off without ultimately becoming a half rate experience.<br><br>Upon entering 45 minutes before closing we confirmed we weren&#39;t there too late for a meal. They absolutely assured us we were fine. <br><br>We were promptly seated. What used to feel like a nice space now feels dirty and worn. The menu is the same as it always has been and very boring at this point. At least it made it easy to avoid what we knew wasnt great.<br><br>After getting water and told our server would be right there to take our order we waited and waited and waited. After 30 minutes I got up to find someone to take our order. We got some sort of lame excuse for the wait and told that their kitchen was now closing. I asked if they would just refund my groupon if we couldn&#39;t actually eat there and they said no. The delivery was rude even though my friend and I remained pleasant. &#34;Why is this making you so angry?&#34; is a completely annoying question when calmly expressing disappointment in the experience. That settled it for us for that night and forever on. They seemed surprised we were leaving but I didn&#39;t see why they would be in the absence of food, atmosphere or service.<br><br>The restaurant is done. Bag it and tag it. Get your coupon refunds from the site you bought them from.	0
Make sure you call in your order before hand, but it is well worth the wait! I&#39;ve been 3 times all getting different items each time and I haven&#39;t had a bad bite yet. Definitely strays away from anything healthy but if you want southern soul food, this is the place to go. Don&#39;t let the area fool you, real diamond in the rough...	1
Ordered a juice &amp; a burrito. Why it took 30 minutes, I have no idea. They weren&#39;t even busy. Won&#39;t be going back.	0
Highly disappointed with this restaurant! I ordered through grubhub and they are only five minutes from my residents driving. I placed an order at 6:15 pm and didn&#39;t receive it until 7:50. When the food finally arrived it was seriously cold, not even warm. I do not have a microwave (personal preference) so I had no way of reheating the food. I contacted grubhub to inform them and they called the restaurant to only be told that due to weather conditions is the only reason the food was cold. I do not believe that as I was able to get home from work in 30 min with the weather conditions and it normally takes me 20 min. So for them to be 5 min away, the food shouldn&#39;t have been cold. All they could offer was $5 off my next $20 purchase, however I will never be ordering from them again. Extremely disappointed and if I was able to give them no stars that is exactly what I would do, but unfortunately you have to give at least one star.	0
Seriously can never get enough of the Steakburger or the Hickyburger not too mention the fries and the Banana Cream Pie! <br><br>Love You Apple Pan ;-)	1
I am a frequent customer but will not be returning again. The noodle soup that I ordered came with a strand of long hair in there. Told the waitress and her response was &#34;this is your hair...&#34; She reluctantly took the food and gave me another one with less items in there with no apology. Don&#39;t come here.	0
This is a happening place, especially if you are under 50. It's a great place for drinks anytime. Checkout the panoramic view of downtown LA from the rooftop bar, particularly at night.The food is excellent; the Bouillabaisse was delicious with salmon saffron in it. If you like french cuisine, the food here will certainly bring you back.We enjoyed our server, Whitney but missteps in the kitchen, three, and one on the bill (my bad, I missed it) take the shine off this four out of five star review.	1
My new favorite breakfast spot, fresh, reasonable and an amazing staff as well! Definitely worth a stop for lunch as well! Also fresh squeezed Orange juice is available and delicious!	1
Went here for the first time today with a friend. Really great prices, great bagels, good portions, was really excited to have found a new breakfast place BUT... I found a hair in almost everything I ate!!! I was SO disappointed because I wanted to love this place. If maybe they were cleaner I would go back but I absolutely won&#39;t.	0
Came here for an alumni happy hour. The food was fine to great and the service was somewhat attentive- they fell short with substitutions (as in they didn't allow it and were unwilling to work with you to make some modifications)	0
Worst customer service!!! If you are non korean i wont recommend going there. They will treat you differently. Food is not that great either. Worst place ever!!!	0
Walked in the door and hostess said there was seating outside. She walked away and then proceeded to pass us by 3 or 4 times in 10 mins, we were like whats going on so we went back into the bar and sat at a table. Waiter got us drinks and then we didn&#39;t see him for 40 mins. Personnel finally delivered baby back ribs but made some stupid comments, offending me and my family. Ribs were actually tough which was incredible considering the hype they have around them. I can actually cook better ribs than this place and I seldom make them. Slaw was mediocre as best as well. Mgr. came to our table and said he would comp us deserts to make up for their tardiness. Ordered a desert each and when the bill came it included 2 deserts. Had to question the Mgr why they were charging when he said they were free, he said he could only comp one so I paid for the other 2 and tipped the waiter 2 bucks on a $100+ bill. No way in hell this place will make it, I&#39;ll give it a year or two at most due to it being overpriced, mismanaged, and food is nothing better than a TGI Firdays	0
WARNING! This place might make you think hamburger is a delicacy, prompting one never to touch another burger everrrr.I gotta say, the Umami burger is without a doubt the most amazing burger I have tried. I never knew burgers could pack such a complex taste into them. The meat was finally cooked and everything went perfect together. My burger was gone in under a minute.Mmm Mmm. Just thinkin about that juicy, succulent burger...bomb. Definitely a place to go if you want to throw 10 dollars on what a burger should be.	1
I like the easy going, welcoming ambiance here. Had their bacon&amp;cheese omelette; very delicious! It came with a hash-brown and toasts. I also ordered coke and the total came close to $11+..which isn&#39;t cheap for lunch, but for the portion served, it was well worth the price... I could have easily shared this meal and that would have been PERFECT!... Their hashborwn was slight burnt but I didn&#39;t complain because there was just too much to EAT. Couldn&#39;t finish the toast and and had much of the coke left so I asked for a take-out. <br><br>Overall experience was great... Lines do get long here..... gotta get here early, otherwise you&#39;ll be waiting long....	1
In exchange for the best fish and chips, we received the worst service from the waitress and the mouth breather behind the bar with the leather black cowboy hat, your typical underachieving barmen with a bitter outlook on the public who provides him with a paycheck. 15 minutes after being seated I was able to flag down our waitress so we could order and that was the last of her until we had to flag her down for the tab. Besides the staff its a great place for good seafood and cool atmosphere.	0
Que parles catala? It&#39;s not easy to find a true Catalan cafe in Miami. There are many Spaniard-Latin American hybrids throughout South Florida, yet none compare to the authenticity of NIU Kitchen. The menu is mostly in Catalan with some English, but the servers and owners speak Spanish and some English, and were more than willing to go through the menu with us. <br><br>We came during the lunch rush on a Monday and the restaurant was mostly full, though for how tiny it is, it is not hard to fill. Not a place for a quick lunch, service is a traditional leisurely pace, though we were in and out in about an hour with a bit of coaxing. We were greeted by the owner, a wonderful Spaniard woman, who is a bit gruff yet helpful once she warms up to you. We asked her for some explanations on the menu and she graciously explained any dish we asked about. <br><br>After listening to her explanations and recommendations, we decided to start with the Pa amb Tomaquet ($3.50), which are small rounds of buttered crusty bread topped with a crushed garlic tomato sauce. It was delicious. They also offer complimentary buttered bread, the same as came in our appetizer, without the tomato topping. <br><br>We were looking for a light lunch to tide us over until dinner, so we ended up ordering only one tapa each. If you are looking for a full meal, you should order two plates per person minimum. I opted for the Llamantol ($15.00), meaning lobster in Catalan, which is an avocado and egg puree topped with large slices of fresh steamed lobster and trout caviar. This dish was exceptionally delicious. My partner decided on the Sopa Marisco ($14.00), which he mistook to be the rice of the day based on the server&#39;s explanation of the rice of the day being soupy, yet thoroughly enjoyed it nonetheless. The broth was delicious and it was packed with different kinds of seafood. <br><br>We would have loved to try several of the other dishes. I see here in the reviews others raving about the pork cheeks and the ous - both of which we will be back to try in the very near future.	1
After reading all the great reviews about this place, my friends and I decided to go here. I have to admit, I&#39;m rather disappointed. There was a long line for this place so that&#39;s always a good sign that there is something good about it. I was wrong.<br><br>Ordered The Earl&#39;s Club, Full Montegu, and Thai wrap.<br><br>The crust of the bread on both sandwiches were way too hard. It got to the point where I wanted to just dunk it in water to soften it up. It also felt like they skimped on the meat and veggies. The sandwiches were just not satisfying at all.<br><br>There was barely any chicken in the Thai wrap. Like two pieces? Felt like I was just eating a veggie wrap. <br><br>Maybe it was just a bad order or just an off day...but seriously, I&#39;d rather go to Subway and get a 5$ foot long.	0
This place is so overrated. I wonder how they get anything above 2 stars.<br><br>They are famous for the abalone porridge with a raw egg in the center of the bowl. If I remember correctly, it costs about $8. <br><br>Give me a break! I don&#39;t even cook and I can make better porridge than this! They don&#39;t give you a lot of abalone and the pieces are the size of a grain of rice. The porridge had no seafood taste, or should I say no taste at all!<br><br>The lady that works there had a poker face. She made me feel like our whole group&#39;s not welcomed and just hope our group finish quickly and leave.<br><br>Nope... No one can drag me back to this place ever again.	0
The Seattle Pho-Natics went to Monkey Bridge on October 6 2009.	1
We went during restaurant week and ordered one of the fish main course options.  It arrived essentially uncooked.  The wait staff was very accommodating in replacing it with something else.  However, by then the dining experience had been ruined.  Given the wide variety of restaurants in the area, we won't be returning here any time soon.	1
Our waitress was not great. She recommended all the fried food and the cheese fry we ordered was too greasy and tasted like they were using old oil to deep fry. Pork shoulder was good but nothing special. The menu didn&#39;t have much vegetables. We were surprised by our bill. Our waitress recommended $18 and $24 wines for a glass!	0
Horrible service. Uncaring, oblivious, and ineffective manager. Another case of a restaurant opening too soon without enough pre-opening training. Give it a couple months and maybe they'll work things out.	0
Ok, lets break it down:	1
Just gross. Went for brunch with my parents, they were horrified. Inside is dirty and in poor condition (guess thats why they keep it so dark), service is terrrrrrrible, and the food is total garbage. I cant think of a single thing we enjoyed. Have no idea how or why this place is so popular.	0
I love this place. Open 24 hours which makes it really convenient for me. Their service is always fast. I place orders online or over the phone and they always deliver faster than they say it will take. The staff has always been really friendly! And the food is great! Large portions and always delivered hot. The breakfast is good and the bakery is decent, but the smoothies and milkshakes are bomb and the lobster grilled cheese is AMAZING! I live downtown and this place has become my go to when I don't feel like cooking or leaving my apt.	1
Jambalaya, lobster Mac and cheese, and cornbread are amazing.  Highly recommended.	1
This was close by to where we were staying during our visit. On the last day prior to our departure we decided to have lunch here based on the reviews on Yelp. <br><br>This is a local hole in the wall with a B rating posted outside of their shop. Sometimes the better foods come from places that aren&#39;t rated A for cleanliness. We ordered the Cuban sandwich and their baked chicken meal with rice and mashed potatoes, and a side order of fried plantains. <br><br>The Cuban sandwich is the real winner. They really load the sandwich up with pork. Portion size is enough to share between two. The bakes chicken was good as well but the breast piece was on the dry side. The rice was decent, had some flavors. The mashed potato was disappointing as it lacked any flavor or seasoning and was only served on its own. The fired plantains was also kind of disappointing as it didn&#39;t taste fresh from the fryer. <br><br>This place is kind of off ways for most people as there&#39;s not much around the neighborhood. I told my friend to check it out but he said they don&#39;t open on weekends. If you&#39;re around for lunch I&#39;d recommend giving their Cuban sandwich a try. It&#39;s cheap, service is friendly and the Cuban is worth getting.	1
This was just an amazing experience for us. We live around the corner and are very happy they are in the neighborhood now. The food is Michelin star quality without paying an arm and a leg. For appetizers, we highly recommend the sashito peppers or cheese ball. And for entrees, we had the pork and grits, and the chicken. It was all so delicious. The service was spectacular. And the wine list is unlike any other one in the area. I highly recommend going here for your next date night or night out with friends for a fantastic meal.	1
Treated my boyfriend here for his birthday dinner since I had a few recommendations from friends to come. We valeted the car and took the elevator up. We had a 8:00 reservation but the host mentioned it may be closer to 8:30 if we wanted an outdoor patio seat. Went up to the rooftop, which was absolutely breathtaking and got two of their signature cocktails.<br><br>At 8:20, we got a text saying that our table was ready and we got quickly sat outside with a view of downtown. We started off with a bottle of wine, octopus, and tuna tartare. I got the salmon entree and boyfriend got the lamb ravioli. Portions were smaller than may have been expected for that price point, but it was totally delicious and worth it. Upon hearing that we were celebrating a birthday, our waitress brought out a complimentary dessert.<br><br>In short, Perch has absolutely beautiful views and the ambiance is amazing. The live band contributed to the evening. I would definitely love to return when I am not shouldering the entirety of the bill.	1
The Bowery is a great place to go when you are in the mood for a casual New York style bistro and don&#39;t mind a crowded space. The food is fairly good and the prices are reasonable. We had the Caesar salad, moulle frites and the beef short ribs. None of these dishes were spectacular but surprisingly they all would have been significantly better if they just would have been salted properly. The wine selections by the glass included an impressive mix of boutique wineries but this was also the source of one of the strangest things I&#39;ve ever witnessed in a restaurant. Our waitress realized that she brought us the wrong glass of white wine after a few sips had been taken. She brought us a new wine and grabbed the 3/4 full glasss. When we told her that we had already tasted it, she just rushed off saying &#34;no problem&#34;. As others have mentioned how small the space is, we couldn&#39;t help but notice the waitress take our glass back to the bar, top it off and promptly deliver it to another table. Crazy. I have to assume that this was a minor gaffe but it certainly is cause for concern. The Bowery is really a borderline 3 star place but it has great potential and I wish L.A. had a few more New Yorkish type places so I gave it four.	1
Had a beer here with the bleu cheese tots the other day here. First let me disclose I'm someone who really doesn't care for bleu cheese, at all... send me the ranch!But these tots were amazing.. Holy-shit did I just like something with bleu cheese? You bet your ass I did. The tots alone were enough to get me to come back. However, if you really want to make a 5-star fan, add some drink specials..	1
The food was excellent and varied. The restaurant is also close to Seattle Center and the service was attentive but quick enough to make a curtain.	1
I have yet to give 5 stars to any place, but the service here was so superb that I just had to! Especially Luis &amp; Eduardo were so attentive. They were so considerate of my 60 year old mother who was sitting in the sun, since their tables have no umbrellas, and brought us an umbrella for our table. We greatly appreciated it &amp; they made is feel right at home. If you get to be served by these 2, feel comfortable knowing you&#39;re in good hands. The venue was nice &amp; relaxing. Our table had the view of the Hollywood sign which was pretty cool &amp; their brunch menu is ok. The pancake lasagna was delicious!	1
This is a very enjoyable spot on the eastern shore. the menu is creative, the food is well prepared, wine list is varied and well priced and service is professional. We enjoy it every time we go. We had the signature hamburgers for lunch and they were in a word,&quot;awesome!&quot; the chef could work on his French fries though.  Desserts are fabulous should have room and coffee is superb.  Try this place!!	0
Horrible service!! They completely forgot the order and there is no heat when it&#39;s freezing outside!!!	0
I came with my family to Tap 79 on 12/29 at 7:15pm, and I will not be returning. We often bring our child with special needs to restaurants so that he can practice his table manners. This restaurant was a real challenge. A 30+ minute wait to receive water for our children, glass beer cups, no straws. And the kicker, after 2 hours of waiting for 3 burgers no food arrived to our table. This would make any parent cringe, as children tend not to behave too well on empty bellies, especially children with autism. We had to leave the restaurant because the wait was so extreme, and had to drive to McDonalds as it was the only nearby restaurant open. Keep in mind that the restaurant was nearly empty when we arrived. This is the worst experience that we&#39;ve had out with our children in this neighborhood. I would not recommend this place to parents with children or any person just ordering food.	0
Everything was good: wings , flatbread, and the burgers. Would def recommend. Service was excellent .	1
How this place doesn&#39;t get 5 stars I&#39;ll never know. The best thing is the pastrami on rye with steak fries and sweet tea... you can&#39;t go wrong! This place has been here for like a thousand years and has NEVER skipped a beat. Go solo, go on a date on Saturday night, or anytime during thew week, you won&#39;t be disappointed. A real Jewish deli and bakery feel... almost a taste of New York right in Los Angeles... Love it! <br><br>OBTW, I&#39;ve been a loyal customer for decades and I highly recommend Canter&#39;s!	1
Good enough daily happy hour. Drinks for $6 such as calamansi martini and lychee martini.I&#39;d come here probably only for cheap drinks. <br><br>We stopped here a random night to pass time for a reservation closeby (see my review for upstate if you like oysters). What immediately turned me off was the resting B face of both bartenders. Then I went to the rest room while waiting for our food. It was FILTHY. like smells like piss from OUTSIDE the door filthy. Unfortunately, they JUST opened and the restaurant was empty. Not sure if it means they&#39;re not exactly super concerned with hygiene. <br><br>Next was the subpar sisig. Yes it came on a sizzling plate. But this version had liver (meh) and no crispy pork pieces I know all good sisig to have. <br><br>Not sure if I&#39;ll be back, cheap drinks can be found elsewhere.	0
Oomasa is way better than Sushi Gen. Sushi Gen used to be great but service sucks and quality of fish is not up to par	1
I actually like this location better than the original location on 57th Avenue and Flagler.<br><br>Because it&#39;s cleaner, better organized, less crowded, easier to park, has a huge ceiling fan, huge television to watch when bored, friendly staff, good variety (although somewhat smaller than the original location&#39;s). Overall, I enjoyed my experience here better.	1
Is this place safe to go to? Yes. I asked the same question. I recommend the Moules Frites Mussels, which is basically mussels in white wine, shallots, and cream, and a side of fries. I love random and innovative food combinations such as this. Turning something simple into something classy!! They have a great selection of Belgian beer, but we missed happy hour, so will be returning for the drink specials and possibly to try the curry mussels. The pot pie was 3 stars cause it had too much breading and not enough crock pot like juice. 4 stars because I liked the ambiance and the mussels a lot!	1
Dearest Yelpers, <br><br>Many of you know me from La Poubelle, Moonshadows or, maybe, Neptune&#39;s Net, but the fact of the matter is that we keep finding ourself in the same place(s). Here&#39;s the thing: we all have our personal preferences. I get that-- really. Some of us want karaoke, underground, avant garde, progressive, posh, hook-ups-- regardless, we want what we like. 9 on Vine is something totally different, and you know it as soon as you walk in the door. Where else can the crowd request a band and have them show up less than a month later? I shit you not! That personable service is like none other, unless you&#39;re referring to the graveyard formerly known as Drai&#39;s! This place is set up like a restaurant between 4 &amp; 7, but quickly becomes a couples bar from 7 &amp; 9, then it transforms into a fuckin&#39; live music werewolf-of-a-venue until close. Do it. Just come. You and your lover/friends/both...ew...will love it. Easy to appreciate, this Hollywood landmark will give you a good time. PS-- they have karaoke on Tuesdays and serve a full menu until 2:30 every night of the week. Get here.	1
We wanted to like it. We wanted to love it actually. <br>The staff is lovely, hence the stars. The food is greasy, over sauced and overhyped. <br>I am a huge French fry lover and even those were too oiley for me. <br>Then- we smelled like fry when we left. That&#39;s a pet peeve if mine... I don&#39;t want to take the restaurant smell with me.	0
If you want a awesome steak at a fair price with unbelievable service.  This is the place.  One of the best steaks I have ever had with the best service I have ever had.  The staff here is amazing.	1
Very disappointed after today&#39;s visit. Been coming here for at least 5 years, so I&#39;ve tried everything here. I&#39;m not sure since when, they decided that the Bandeja Paisa doesn&#39;t have chorizo, as a Colombian we all know what comes in it.	0
Unique place to get some grub. They specialize in burgers, sandwiches, and salads. Seems to be a cool lunch joint and very popular to grab a drink after work or the ball game.Finally made it here for lunch and ordered the soma burger (avocado, grilled onions,swiss) and the Hawaiian (pineapple, ham, lettuce, pickles). Fries came with each order and almost forgot about our salted caramel milk shake!We were disappointed with the patty. It should have been seasoned a bit more, it just tasted like it was missing something. Don't get me wrong the presentation, size portion, and the flavors of the other ingredients was on spot but it tasted a little bland. The salted caramel milk shake was vanilla ice cream mixed with caramel from a squeeze bottle. I guess I was hoping for something like bi-rite's salted caramel in milk shake form, doesn't that sound sick? For $31.00 there are other burger joints that I rather chow down on.	0
I&#39;ve been to this place a handful of times since last year and every time has been a pleasant experience. Try the pepperoni pizza, it&#39;s delicious! Also, the homemade smores are really good and messy. Follow them on Facebook because they frequently have 50% off promotion codes.	1
Fact: ply me with sangria, chorizo, cheese and grabanzos fritos and I will overlook your restaurant&#39;s (slightly less than) mediocre service. We had to wave down our server because we felt neglected at a tiny table outside, but that didn&#39;t stop our small group from having a wonderful time.<br><br>Next time we will make reservations so that we can enjoy the charming atmosphere inside the rinconcito, which is quite cute and homey as others have described. Also, the menu is quite varied, and I am looking forward to trying more of it in the future.<br><br>Salud!	1
Best Noodle House so far	1
Came for Dinela for lunch. It was very busy.All I can say is The Six has an incredible signature burger. It was very juicy and the buns were toasted to perfection. I would definitely go back. I definitely recommend reservations and if you go for lunch there is plenty of parking on the back street.Price was only $16 but I got the truffle fries which was $7. All in all a good place for lunch but be prepared to spend 2 hours if you are doing the dinela since it got super busy.	1
The coffee is so good here!!And I love that they open at 7am.	1
I don&#39;t see what the whiners complain about. It&#39;s basically mid-town, with a great view, it&#39;s cheaper than the other rooftop pool places, the staff is just as nice as they are attractive, the food is good.<br><br>A welcome respite from the street below.	1
Great little place to stop by after work if you're in the Hollywood area. Looking forward to trying their food. Bartenders are always friendly and easy going.	1
have been going here for years. delicious. very low key. very simple food, no frills.	1
The food was exceptional and the service was impeccable. I look forward to my next visit.	1
I wish I lived closer because I would have breakfast here everyday!Not too many places serve Salmon Lox and Bagel with all the fixings and then some! The portion size was huge but it didn't go to waste because I made sure to eat all of it....lolMy friend ordered the Breakfast Burrito and Beligum Waffle and that was excellent too!Service was with a smile =)	1
Was pretty disappointed in my meal here, i had a great meatball experience my first few time i had been to this chain, once in their original LES place and once in williamsburgh, though both times i recall not liking their whole weat bread/. I think hype helps a place like this, i did not find it so much so exceptional. I live very close to here but see no reason to return.	0
I&#39;ve never heard of this place until I received a gift certificate from my brother-in-law to go here. Following my experience, I must say what a darn good gift!<br><br>I&#39;ll start out with the &#34;Cons&#34;: this place is tiny. It&#39;s not at all suitable for groups of more than 4, and even for groups of 3-4, seating is rare with an average 25 minute wait (but this is only if you choose to dine-in and we did come on a Saturday evening). My husband &amp; I chose to sit at the bar by the window, but it was hard not to feel like you were invading the space of the family who sat at the table behind us. Also, I ordered a nonalcoholic shake (I&#39;m not a drinker). Though the description surely sounded uniquely delish, once I tried it (Berry Shake), it was quite average. <br><br>And now to the &#34;Pros&#34; (which made all the cons disappear)! Initially, I was disappointed in myself for not ordering any of the special fries because they all looked so scrumptious that I really had to try something- totally didn&#39;t. Dig this: good thing I didn&#39;t. I ordered the Old Time Religion ($8.95 that includes arugula, goat cheese, roasted tomato, and truffle aioli)- let the angels commence their singing here! Oh my God it was so good, I talked about it all night. There&#39;s full--- and then there&#39;s satisfied. I was satisfied! A great portion sized burger for a gal like me who enjoys eating. My husband ordered the Leadbelly ($6.95; his thing is, whenever visiting a place for the 1st time, always try their signature item). Whatever works for you babe! Both of our burgers were perfectly cooked to a medium, with a great sear on the buns. It&#39;s not a close driving distance to where we live, but we&#39;d totally return no hesitation. Not to mention the sweet old man who was hosting/busing tables and helped us 1st time visitors and made it feel so homely there! Leadbelly is now a must-go-to place for Date Night!	1
Late review but I came here for Valentines Day. Loved the place. Decor was interesting. Very early 20th century. Food was outstanding. Looking forward to going back and sitting in the outdoor section. Maybe today!	1
After months of hearing how amazing this place is, went with my best friend last night and was so disappointed by both the food and service, I was tempted to leave without tipping, and I was a server for years so I know what a slap in the face that is!<br><br>Still, this place needs some sort of wake up call. (We did tip in the end, I just decided to Yelp instead.)<br><br>We were sat quickly but at a small, dark table with a view of the hallway to the bathroom, not a great start but okay, whatever, life goes on. <br><br>Here&#39;s where things started to go awry:<br><br>We sat there with our menus for almost twenty minutes waiting to order. And we would have just continued sitting there but we finally flagged down the hostess, after being ignored by every server and busser who passed, and asked for our order to be taken. She sent over a server, not OUR server but A server, who finally took our order and never apologized for the insanely unnecessary wait. <br><br>Ten minutes later, our waitress finally came over to check on us and said, &#34;Oh, sorry about that. I got stuck talking to that table of guys.&#34;<br><br>Seriously!?! I hope you got a number or a date or a sugar daddy because that is the worst excuse for failing to do your job that I&#39;ve heard in a long time. Or maybe it&#39;s the best and most honest. Still, we were effing hungry and she wasn&#39;t doing the service part of her serving job. <br><br>On to the meal...<br><br>We ordered the Baked then Fried Potatoes, the Brussels Sprouts, Brick Chicken and Chickpea Sandwich. <br><br>The potatoes came out first and were a little unruly in size but tasty thanks to the &#34;smoked ketchup&#34; (which basically just tastes like ketchup and BBQ sauce mixed together) and the onion dip. Too bad we needed more sauce to go with our monster potatoes. Rut roh. That means we need our waitress again. <br><br>Guess what happened? Nothing! We sat there for another ten minutes waiting for someone to check on us. Which they NEVER did. I finally had to get up from the table to find our server to get more sauce. I should&#39;ve tipped myself for all the damn work I did for her.<br><br>Next came the chicken, which had some truly scrumptious grilled haricot verts underneath, and the chickpea sandwich, which was really more like a taco, an under-salted, dry, crumbly and lukewarm taco I would never order again.<br><br>After all of that food was eaten finally came everyone&#39;s favorite dessert: Brussels sprouts! Say what? Who is expediting in that kitchen? And, more importantly, these are one of my favorite vegetables but at Blue Cow they were underseasoned, undercooked and bizarrely served on a bed of tomato sauce that did nothing but bring out the copious perfume of rosemary caking the vegetables. A terrible terrible flavor combination! <br><br>They were also out of one of their four signature cocktails (fo&#39; reals?!?), the only part of our meal that they offered to comp as an apology. <br><br>Overall, it was some of the worst service I&#39;ve experienced in a long time, all for food I could have made much better and more afforably at home (except for those green beans and the onion whip, those were awesome).	0
The Eddy is a super cute, chilled spot with excellent food. Perfect for a girls night or a date. The food was delicious (try the gnocchi!) and the service was flawless. My favourite thing about the place though is the ambiance, rustic, casual, warm and cosy. I think it&#39;s owned by the same guy who owns Wallflower in the West Village and that&#39;s awesome too.	1
Now, I went here before I went to eat at the El Rey. I found this place via yelp and the greatest thing about this restaurant was that I could make a reservation. <br><br>Walking in, no problem. Sat right down. The service was good. She was first on point. We all ordered -- the party of four. I had tilapia with some sweet potato fries. My boyfriend had tacos, three steak with some guac. The other couple had some salad, tacos and then .. GRR, I forget the last! But we also ordered some tater tots and pickles. <br><br>Now my irk isn&#39;t with the food. Or with all the food. All of the food was great. The tater tots were to die for. It made me think of when I was in grade school but ten times better because they could actually fry the little balls of goodness. LOL. As I type this, my mouth waters. Now, the food was good. My only issue was that the taco plate was 7 bucks. Now since my boyfriend got all of them with steak, it was 1.50 EACH. That just seems ridiculous to me. To top it off, the steak had this funny and nasty aftertaste. After a couple of bites, he didn&#39;t touch the rest. Of course he could have said something -- which I wish he did but he&#39;s too nice. <br><br>Nonetheless, when the server came around, my boyfriend made a comment that it wasn&#39;t that good, she replied that it wasn&#39;t something she recommended? Really? <br><br>So as my recommendation to you, fellow yelpers, do not come here. Save yourself the time. Or hell, if you really love tater tots like I do, come here for them and a glass of something -- then leave.	0
Others are right, NO CLUE why this place has 5 stars!! The food sucks, we had rice, lamb, sausage and kifta and all was barely edible, rice and sausage were terribly dry and the rest tasteless, there are much better middle eastern places around that sell food that&#39;s 100% better. Skip it and go to Karam on 4th or hazar on 5th.	0
A real hole in the wall, but they are KNOWN. Many people have referred me to this place, and I can understand why.I've had the abalone porridge and the Sam Gae Tang here. Both came out piping hot, as it should. Both dishes were great, and I can totally understand the comfort from eating these when ill or hung over. Hell, I'm not Korean but this definitely hits the spot. It's a really small place with a tiny parking lot. Service was alright, a few ajumas doing their thing. Open 24-7, which is nice to know. However, my Korean friend insists that I try Bon Juk for porridge (he calls Mountain quite ghetto), so I'd probably have to compare and see which one I'd prefer more.	1
I can't really give Serious Pie, a Tom Douglas restaurant, a 3 stars bc I feel it's better than A-okay. Yet, even though the pizza we had was very good, I can't say that I am a fan either. However, the service was very good and timely ( we arrived a bit before than 6? on a weeknight), so I am giving Serious Pie 4 stars overall.	0
Living in Boyle Heights it's kind of hard finding a good pizza joint. I have been ordering from these guys for a couple of years now. The Dantes Revenge and the Sloppy pig is awesome. If you are going to order from here make sure that you are not on a diet. Both of my favorite pizzas are probably the greasiest but man is good with a beer watching the game. Plus they deliver locally.	1
Greasy food, poor ambience and an unusually long wait. The breakfast is good if you are in need of some grease. <br><br>This is one of the only places open late for dinner in the South Park area of Downtown (the other being Denny&#39;s).	0
See my stars	1
I appreciate the atmosphere, but I don't like needing to literally yell over my food to speak to someone sitting across a small table. The food was good, waitstaff was nice and attentive. But, again, hard to hear over the BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM.	1
Maybe the over the top plating, and cheesy decor at Barton G was supposed to be a distraction from how mediocre the food was, but it didn&#39;t work. It was as though they tried so hard to make the presentation &#34;artistic&#34; or &#34;different&#34;, that they forgot about the actual food. All in all, it was EGREGIOUSLY overpriced, the presentation was only cool for the first minute to take a photo and then became annoying when trying to eat, and the decor was chintzy and cold. I can see what they were going for, but it was not done well.	0
It took 30 minutes to get our drinks, and the bar wasn't even slammed. The food was pretty good, but they forgot to bring out one of the dishes. Our poor friend got her dish by the time everyone else had been finished with theirs.It very well could be that the bartender forgot about our drinks, and the chef our complete order, but our server did not even come over to apologize, and instead decided to avoid our cabana.We had to get up to get our bill, get up to get it fixed, and then get up to ask for our credit cards back after payment. Uhh, that is not okay.Yes, our server was nice and smiley, but that wasn't enough to redeem this awful experience. Customer service at its worst.One star for spotting Milo Ventimiglia on his way out.	0
This restaurant is in a kind of weird shopping center location, but it was near my hotel so I gave it a try. I wasn&#39;t expecting much, but I was pleasantly surprised. I had the arroz con pollo several times (I became a regular). The portions were huge and really satisfying. I love the fact that they deliver. Miami traffic is ridiculous and so is finding a spot in that parking lot during lunch time.	1
Hickory burgers are da BOMB! I luv the sauce and it goes great with a diet coke, fries, and banana cream pie w/a scoop of vanilla ice cream! You have to get all of that to fully enjoy your meal! Sitting gets messy though because it's sooooo BUSY inside. You have to wait behind someone and it's based on the honor system. Usually those standing against the wall are waiting for someone to get up and leave. I've never seen it NOT busy, even at odd hours, there's always a line somewhere. Parking is horrible too. Small spaces in the back and very limited street parking. It's right across the street from the mall, but I don't recommend parking there either. Gets crowded and why are the spaces sooo small or is it just the bad parkers out there?!I would come here more often, if it was closer to me!	1
FINALLY....... A great sushi place with great food as long as sushi close to home! First time there took my 2 daughter &amp; my neice. Completely astonished with their extensive menu and quality of food! Such a family atmosphere u almost feel like everyone around you actually lives in the neighborhood. The I Love Lucy Roll..... Is too delicious to explain! BUT the patai noodle! oMG! My 3 year old faught everyone in the table for the plate! This place is YUMMY!!!!!!!!	1
The empanada&#39;s and arepa&#39;s were super breaded and greasy (half inch of breading and oozed grease when I attempted to break it in half. Not a fan. <br>Service was decent and place seemed clean though.	0
My friends took me here when visiting LA. I loved it. It was a Friday morning and thank God it was rainy, we only had to wait 15 minutes. According to my LA friends, you almost always have to wait to get in here since this place is so popular. The host didn&#39;t seem to care as much ... he barely picked up his pen to write the name and the number of people and then he disappeared. He did seat us at a very nice table though. Menu wasn&#39;t all that, your regular breakfast- eggs. potatoes, fruit, sandwiches. However, they have a hot chocolate on the menu and it says &#34;The best one you&#39;ve had&#34; or something along those line ... well let me tell you... it was THE BEST hot chocolate I have ever had in my whole life, I am not exaggerating, it was so delicious I still dream of it back in Boston. We didn&#39;t see any celebrities, or maybe we did but I didn&#39;t recognize them... but again, according to my friends-all these celebs are there &#34;like all the time&#34;. They saw Eva Longoria and her husband on their last trip, oh well, big deal... But Toast is definitely a must if you live/visit LA.	1
I don&#39;t know how people eat here. The lady sitting at the back door of the restaurant was smoking a cigarette and I highly doubt she washed her hands before going back to cooking. <br><br>As soon as we walked into the restaurant we were hit with a nauseating smell. It smelled like the restaurant had not been properly cleaned in quite some time and that there was dirty sewage water in close proximity. We walked out and made the executive decision to leave because we thought there was a good chance we may get a food borne illness.	0
Very loud - really harsh - and horrible drinks. Servers were kind of difficult. Maybe I wasn&#39;t &#39;cool&#39; enough.	0
The food is absolutely fantastic. The pricing is way off, however. If they worked this out, they'd be unstoppable.	1
With so many long reviews, I will only add that this is among the most creative and inspired restaurants in any city. The owners and chef are just what you hope for. Please order the white kimchi noodles (not spicy) if you are just visiting LV, or you will miss out on one of the best dishes anywhere ever. Nuff said.	1
I&#39;ve been to this place twice now and both times the food was filling but healthy. I should have written the review right after but I can&#39;t remember what I had but I remember thinking it was delicious both times. I have to say this place is the perfect date place because it is just very very romantic as it is set on the hill. As well, you have to know exactly where the restaurant is because there is no sign to let you know but basically there is a parking lot for the restaurant in front and you valet and go through there to get to the restaurant.	1
Toast is a really trendy LA place. You can spot celebs here if thats your thing. It&#39;s not too $$$ for it being trendy. Parking sucks but it does everywhere in LA.	1
Unbelievable pork sandwich! Unfortunately there was no sitting when we went, but maybe they have chairs in the patio during the summer. Can&#39;t wait to come back!	1
Went there for my friends 20th bday!! The mac and cheese was delicious. My friend got the mushroom pizza I think and I had a slice. It was a bit too intense for me, not sure why though.<br><br>We ordered two desserts to share between the 4 of us. The chocolate cake/apple pie thing.. Delicious..<br><br>Only valet parking, but i found a spot right near by	1
When we think of Bistros we think small and intimate. We were very surprised at the size of this Restaurant. Although there is not much of a view being that it is in a Casino but the ambiance was clean, modern and comfortable. The service was excellent, our waiter Keith couldn't have been nicer and accomodating. The food looked and tasted homemade. The ice cream was the best. The price was reasonably priced. We'd go back again.	1
Ever taken a bite and felt an overwhelming urge to cry, out of sheer joy? That just happened to me with the bagel and smoked salmon plate here. Holy shit. I mean I'm Jewish so I've been exposed to some legit bagel and lox combos. But with avo, capers, shaved parmesan, and tomato, The Wood Bagel just gangbanged on my taste buds. Unreal.	1
Came here yesterday (03-20-15) with my boyfriend to try this place out. We ordered 6 piece sweet heat chicken wings, 6 piece hot chicken wings, macaroni salad, french fries, fried pickles and 2 sweet teas since I always hear and read about people stating how amazing the teas are.<br><br>The sweet heat sauce was really sweet. No heat to it at all. I liked it but wish there was a little heat to it. The hot sauce was actually what it is hot. I liked it. The French fries were great. Crispy outside and soft on the inside. I fried pickles were great too. Only if they had a dipping sauce for it :(. The macaroni salad was a little bit in the salty side. The sweet teas... WAY TO SWEET! I swear I thought they put a whole bag of sugar in itt. I watered mine down and it was still to sweet that I had to have them put some unsweetened tea in it which the lady at the counter was super nice and didn&#39;t mind doing that for me.<br><br>The staff were all super nice. Very pleasant and they all greet you as soon as you walk in. It was also clean on the inside as well. I can&#39;t wait to try this place out again!	1
I came here for a group dinner Friday night. The place takes reservations, which is always nice. The place is not big or average-sized. It is small. The tables are so close together, that when I leaned back, my upper back hit the person behind me. Not cool.<br><br>I saw that previous yelpers enjoyed their specialty cocktails. I had the pumpkin. It was a little too strong for my taste. My fellow diners said theirs were fine...but I got the impression that it was nothing life-changing.<br><br>The food menu follows the pattern of the restarant size. Small. I am not against small menus, but most of the items we ordered (tapas sharing style) were either mediocre or poor tasting. The good: the beef jerky, and butternut squash. The bad: eggplant, rice, collard greens, and the cocktails. The average: chicken wings and st louis rbs. Although the jerky and squash were tasty, they are items I would not come back for.<br><br>The service was excellent.<br><br>so: I left hungry. The group of us considered going to artichoke pizza around the corner....which we should&#39;ve originally since our bill was quite high for being unsatisfed (taste wise).	0
This place had highly questionable quality of ingredients and lacked flavor in the food served. We ordered the oxtail clay pot and the walnut shrimp. The clay pot did not have much oxtail. It seemed as if the restaurant had a universal clay pot base and just dumped different types of meats in it. The sauce of the clay pot definitely did not have the gooey richness of slow-cooked ox tail. The walnut shrimp was abysmal. It was over-battered, over-sugared, and over-cooked.Overall terrible food and terrible ambiance. Given that it was right on Grant, I should have expected no better.	0
I always have a great time when I stop by, and luckily I never have to wait long. <br><br>it&#39;s a very romantic spot to take someone if they&#39;ve never really seen the skyline of LA. It&#39;s incredibly refreshing to be able to come up here after a long day at work or even on the weekends for some fun with friends. <br><br>I haven&#39;t had the pleasure of trying much of their food, but the drinks are great and really pack a punch. Old fashions are always a must, and they&#39;ve got a fairly good variety of Scotch. <br><br>One thing is, the access to the roof top portion is limited and the lines to get to the 16th floor are often long. But grab a drink and wait in line!	1
My family of 8 has several foodies that know how to get down. They all loved Bahama breeze and enjoyed their evening!	1
Six stars. One of the best meals we ever had. Great food, great service. What more can you ask for.	1
Great atmosphere excellent food & wine! Loved the brie appetizer & the chop salad	1
Attentive service enjoyable atmosphere well orchestrated dishes. Only downbeat was occasional difficulty in breathing due to smoke coming out of kitchen (maybe less of issue if sitting away from the bar?).	1
My entree was not made as well as in the past .  My appetizer seemed to be smaller in portion size.  My dessert had a wet mushy graham cracker crust on the bottom and the banana filling was relatively bland.	1
This used to be a great place where the variety of cuts and taste of the meats and poultry was unparalleled. Regretfully, the quality has gone downhill and the meat selection is scant at best. Not to mention that they considerably increased the prices. I doubt I&#39;d return here anytime soon	0
Been to Raku at least 25-30 times since they opened. Being a part of the industry crowd it was awesome to have a late night place with the kinda food I like. This town is crying for better food without having to go to the strip or some shitty chain restaurant. I think that restaurants have spent years taking advantage of the fact that a lotta peeps still have the buffet mentality. Most bang for the buck even if it&#39;s frozen, reheated then slathered in mayonnaise. <br><br>The quality of the food, presentation, setting etc is exceptional and should be the standard for restaurant expectations. People are tripping when they say Raku is overpriced. If you are that cheap and don&#39;t understand good food then stick to all you can eat sushi or the $10 buffet. <br><br>Compared to any Japanese restaurant in the country for the prices they charge the food is phenomenal stars. <br><br>However the issue I have is my last 2 visits. I saw a big change in their service staff from last year, not sure what happened. The old lady BTW is A FUCKING RUDE BITCH. Yes I come from an Asian background in culinary as well and what the hell is your problem after we spend $300 - $400 every time we go there??? <br><br>Last couple of times they were out of numerous menu items. Understandably they prep x amount per day, but not once did they say that items were not available until we tried to order. It was annoying to the point that I finally asked the waitress to just tell me what they did not have. She next proceeded to repeat what I had already ordered, but was not available. Thanks. This happened several times. Getting drink order and refills was a major pain in the ass. The first round of food we ordered, all cold apps took nearly 50 minutes. In addition, some items we ordered the waitress came back 30 minutes later to tell us they were sold out. Table wasn&#39;t even bussed then somewhere near the 3rd round of food they came and pulled plates that we were still working on. <br><br>All in all the service during my last 2 visits was almost nonexistent. Maybe it was the fact that on one of those visits the owner had a big party of friends on one table and that was their primary focus of the night. Who knows? I&#39;ve seen lots of people being comped items and that doesn&#39;t bother me. The only thing I would expect is to have someone at least come to check on our drinks, bus the table without having to wait 25 minutes and at least keep us informed when food is going to take an hour. I love the food there and I would still recommend it to anyone, but the service has plainly gone to shit.	0
What more can I add? It&#39;s all true--the good, the bad, and the pastrami.<br><br>I always get the matzoh ball soup and a &#34;Rube Ruben&#34; (extra cheese). I&#39;ve been there with nerds, rockers, clowns, and my grandmother (who&#39;s been going since it opened)!<br><br>Downside: I&#39;m not sure they have a wheelchair-accessible bathroom.<br>Bonus activity: watch the bread slicer in action!	1
This place completely screwed us on price. My group comes in, the hostess starts handing us these mimosas we don't ask for and that I don't want to accept because I don't want to be charged on them (spoiler alert: we are). I try to refuse but she keeps coming back until we all have one. I should have been smarter and asked but damage done. THEN I ask for a side salad and am charged for more than the cost of a regular salad (14). That plus the BS mimosa charge of 12 for a mimosa in a plastic cup and I end up paying 30 including the mandatory tip for a completely subpar brunch. What a waste of money and time. At least be upfront in your costs and stop screwing customers for mediocre brunches.	0
This place has become my favorite restaurant in Sunnyside. I eat here (/get delivery) 1-3 times per week and am NEVER disappointed.<br><br>Chicken gizzards, mung bean jelly, pan-fried momos (barely fried at all!), mango lassi, paneer chili...all of these dishes are amazing. SUCH a lovely addition to the neighborhood.	1
I really adore this place! The hostess is amazing... always so happy and super helpful! Easy to get a table and the food is freaking fabulous!!! Crab legs are where its at. Whats even better is my friend and I walked out of there with a check for $35 and we ate SO MUCH! I wish I could give 5 stars but as per previous review.. the bartender is kind of a massive d*ck. Order your drinks from your server and you will have a sweet night.	1
Los Angeles is a city that builds for now, and values what&#39;s new and shiny. That lends a particular value and rarity to places like the pantry. It just feels like it&#39;s always been there and its content to remain itself as the world changes around it. I love the menu on the wall, the coat hooks by the tables and the way the linoleum floor is worn in front of the cash register. I like to think about who has stood there before me over the years. <br><br>But a business does not survive in LA by being a source of nostalgia alone. The food is prepared quickly and you always know what to expect. A meal always starts with a shredded cabbage cole slaw and those thick cuts of sourdough toast browned right on the griddle. I pretty much always order the country fried steak. Done the traditional way with a tenderized cube steak breaded and covered with sausage gravy with plenty of sausage pieces, you&#39;re not leaving hungry. <br><br>The prices are higher than you would expect from a coffee shop, probably about 5 dollars more than Denny&#39;s, but then again that&#39;s because its not Denny&#39;s. <br><br>I have never seen the place quiet and I&#39;ve never seen anyone working there go anywhere leisurely. The servers may look frazzled because of this but I&#39;ve never had a rude or incompetent server. The bustle is part of the charm, and I like to sit at the counter and watch the cook at the griddle, its better than benihana. <br><br>The pantry is one of those places that is a key part of the Angelino experience. Go there after a Laker game, after last call downtown, or because its 4 AM and you start work at 6. Its served generations of Angelinos, and I like to think I&#39;ll bring future children and grandchildren there someday.	1
24hour spot that serves delicious food. They did change there menu (a few friends were disappointed) BUT overall it's a go go. C'mon it's open 24hours. Order a root bear float with the pastrami short rib sandwich. PLEASE at least the sandwich! It's my favorite. Oh yeah and Mac and cheese balls. Thanks you.	1
Decided to try Ramen Misoya Tomi because of the high rating on Yelp. I was a bit disappointed at the interior, pretty divy but not in a cozy, comfortable way. There we also this giant billboard on the miracles of miso, which was somewhat amusing. We were the only customers so the server seemed nice and we got our food right away. My husband ordered the tonkatsu ramen and I had the Hokkaido-style miso ramen. The chashu pork had a great smoky flavor although they were cut in smaller chunks in my ramen. The broth was good but also pretty standard. It won&#39;t be enticing me to return to this sad and lonely ambience. Our server although polite and friendly, was uncomfortably pushy about us writing a Yelp review on the spot, in exchange for a free can of soda. She knocked the price of soda off our bill and was making sure that I wrote a review. No, checking in wasn&#39;t enough either. I told her that I don&#39;t write reviews on the spot and that we had left extra cash to cover the drink. Talk about an awkward experience. In hindsight, I wonder what she would have done if I wrote a scathing one star review of the joint while she watched? Teehee.	0
Somebody help me, I ate all the seafood in the ocean and now I'm gonna die a lonely mermaid. This was a singularly defining seafood restaurant for me. Yes, it was hot and smoky, and the service was whatever, but the seafood. THE EFFIN SEAFOOD. We get set C, which is a fantastic deal for 4 very hungry or 5 kinda hungry people. We had all the kimchis, corn cheese, and seafood pancake - all were serviceable. I was waiting for the main event. As soon as those little clams hit the grill and split open with their juicy bellies, I was done. Then I had the bigger clams. Then I had the mussels. Then I had the lobster. Just when I thought I was done, they pull me back in with the eel. It was f*cking ridiculous. Everything was super fresh and tasted like the ocean. So yeah, come if you want to make the Saw version of the Little Mermaid like I do. If you're gonna whine about perfectly fine table service in a dingy seafood bbq restaurant, I demand that you get the hell out of my heaven, I don't want you stinkin' up the joint.	1
The soup can be fiery and the hand-pulled noodles are satisfyingly chewy. That&#39;s all I need to keep coming back.<br><br>This Xi&#39;an Famous Foods location feels very much off the beaten path near the BQE boundary of Greenpoint and Williamsburg, but it&#39;s well worth a visit if you&#39;re in the area. It&#39;s a very tiny place even compared to other Xi&#39;an Famous Foods locations, but the staff recently moved the counters back to provide room for a few small tables. I just count myself fortunate to be within walking distance so I can always get a delicious lunch (and follow-up lunch) to go -- usually Zha Jiang Mian and Liang Pi. Recently I&#39;ve been changing things up a bit with their lamb dishes as well.	1
Such an awesome go to diner. The menu seems endless and I haven't been disappointed yet. Good sized portions and the place has a very cool swag to it. Its 24/7/365 so thats a huge win. Highly recommending this diner to anyone & everyone.	1
Going to Canter&#39;s is like taking a step back in time to the 1960s. The food is fine if you&#39;re looking for a midnight snack. And even if you order something that&#39;s bad, at least you&#39;re not paying much for it! I&#39;ve always thought that the service here was great too: they know what matters to the just-left-the-bar crowd...keep the glasses of water full!	1
Hello foodies!! Here&#39;s a place you don&#39;t want to miss out on! As I write with pure excitement, this place rocks most of the trendiest places in Los Angeles!!! The food is spectacular no matter what you order! Recently, I came here with my gals to have a nice LA night out. We all ordered different entrees from the menu: Mac n cheese with a mouse trap presentation- to die for!!! The entree was so delicious and the amount of cheese wasn&#39;t overwhelming the dish, just perfect!! The &#34;Birds Eye View&#34; chicken with Brussels sprouts and grits- yum yum yum!!! The chicken was perfectly cooked with the right amount of seasoning, the grits smothered with cheese, and the Brussels sprouts were phenomenal!!!! I have to say I&#39;ll be back for some more!!! Now,<br>the presentation was great too! The dish was served on top of a wooden base with a big metal chicken!!! Adorable:) Also, one of my friends ordered a dish that I can&#39;t recall the name for, but that too had a presentation out of this world. It came in a pottery base with flowers in a pot! So cute and so out of this world!!! This place has the best of both worlds: presentation and taste!!! You gotta bring your date or partner!!! It&#39;s a must!!!!	1
As soon as you walk in to this place you are welcomed by the friendly owner....i live this place because their food is delicious. They make handmade tortillas which are so soft and warm. I have tried their burritos and tacos and the taste was like nothing i had tried before( aside from my mommy&#39;s cooking). Also their shrimp tacos are super good..i def. recommend them if u aren&#39;t allergic to them. The only reason this place did not recieve 5 stars was because we ordered food to go and my bf was missing 4 tacos he had ordered which was dissapointing because he was looking fotward to eating his favorite tacos! Overall this place is delicious!:)	1
The burgers here are just your normal run of the mill burgers (bun, meat, cheese, lettuce, pickles, and sauce) but they&#39;re pretty good. The menu is concise; there&#39;s nothing fancy or out of the ordinary to order. I think I saw a turkey sandwich and egg salad sandwich or something but if you come here, why even think about ordering something besides the burgers.<br><br>The only thing that confused me were the prices. $6.50 for a burger + $.50 if you want cheese. Fries? Like $2.50 more. Just ridiculous for what you can buy at In-n-Out for half the price. Yes. It&#39;s pretty much like In-n-Out.<br><br>If you&#39;re still going to come to this place, here&#39;s some advice. Seat your self even if there&#39;s trash sitting on the counter. We wandered around confused for a couple minutes not knowing what we should do. Thanks for not telling us to just have a seat.<br><br>Two stars because it&#39;s good and all, but I&#39;ll never come here again or recommend it.	0
The palabok is delicious! Better than Krystals or Ihawan. Its as close to authentic as you can get in new york. I ordered a tray of palabok for a party and everyone loved it. Kuya Miguel, the cook/manager/waiter was also very accommodating and helpful and even offered to accompany me to the subway to help me carry my stuff. This place is definitely a must try for people who loves filipino food!	1
Vintage is a great go-to place for dinner and drinks. I recently went for a friend's birthday on a Sunday night. Plenty of tables available for our large group.	0
Update: I received a response to an email I sent to Havana Harrys about my experience and they only replied back telling me that the 2 locations are independently own. That was all.	0
Heck no techno.<br>Not only is it beyond busy (can&#39;t really imagine why), the staff was not helpful, orders were wrong, and the food was forgettable. <br><br>This was such a let down. I was running late to a group breakfast with my parents and another couple, I told my mom to order for me. Without looking at a menu, I just said to get a Reuben.<br><br>When I got there, my food was waiting for me, and everyone was eating besides my mom. I guess that the waitress had gotten the order wrong, and my mom was waiting for a new plate. My mom said that I would be arriving later, and my plate arrived early.<br><br>As I tried to eat my (cold) sandwich, I asked for some thousand island and water.<br><br>While we were eating, a different waitress comes and says, &#34;I was told to bring you a muffin.&#34; <br><br>Not, hello, I have a muffin for you. Or, did someone need a muffin?<br><br>She sounded unhappy to be handing out delicious muffins. How can you be grumpy when you are handing out bomb muffins?<br><br>Overall, overpriced, bland, mushy food.<br>The fries were good though.<br>This is also the 2nd time that orders have been wrong for my parents. Not cool.<br><br>Thanks but no thanks.	0
I was bringing my family to Cracker Barrow today a group of 6 but after hearing they fired a 73 year old Vet for handing out a Corn muffin I changed my mind...... I hope others feel the same way......	0
Local food,	1
A friend and I went in today for lunch and we did the buffet. First there weren't many items to choose from. Just a couple of meat dishes but a whole lot of vegetable dishes.	1
Two stars for being available 24 hours but everything else is meh... and my least favorite part is, if I do come here, I always leave smelling like LA Cafe, and that's not a good thing. I like that they serve fresh OJ, but it's too bad it's crazy expensive. Their food is greasy and salty but, hey, it hits the spot if you're drunk, like most any places!!	0
this place continues to impress me every single time.<br><br>first of all, I&#39;ve never ordered anything off the menu that I haven&#39;t been satisfied with. If I ever did, the staff is seriously so nice that I would feel so comfortable mentioning my &#34;issue&#34; and I am confident that they would take care of me. In all honesty, there have been maybe 1 or 2 times that our waitress was a little on the &#34;crabby&#34; side - but in their defense, this place is always busy and you can tell that the staff is hustlin&#39; for the most part. I&#39;ve even witnessed a single customer once complaining about his ham tasting &#34;funny&#34; -- I felt so bad for the waiter who was more than accommodating to the gentleman&#39;s needs and quickly brought him whatever else he asked for.<br><br>breakfast here rocks -- makes me smile!<br>their sandwiches are delish &amp; their salads are very good too. again, i&#39;ve been with friends who have ordered an item and not gotten what they expected. before they could even say what was &#34;wrong&#34;, our server has offered to either bring something else or not charge us.<br><br>what really impressed me about this place....<br>I ate a salad here for lunch one day and towards the end of my salad, there was a piece of plastic (either from the lettuce bag or cucumber wrap). keep in mind, 3/4 of my salad was now in my tummy! I told the waitress and she was very apologetic. she brought our bill and had removed the salad - very nice and of course, what one would expect. HOWEVER (it doesn&#39;t stop here and this is what really impressed me about Toast and will keep me as a loyal customer), a very nice gentleman (the manager?) came to our table and said, &#34;hey guys, I understand someone had some plastic in their salald?&#34; I told him it was me and he was more than apologetic. He said that he does his best to make sure the prep staff and the chefs are careful and it must have been from produce packaging. The way he spoke with me and approached the situation was unlike anything i&#39;d ever experienced. This guy was truly sorry and not just because he didn&#39;t want to get in &#34;trouble&#34;, but because (well or so it seemed) he really didn&#39;t want me to have a bad experience at this establishment. I said &#34;it happens. human error&#34; and thanked him from removing it from the bill. He also said that dessert was on the house if we wanted anything (we didn&#39;t order any dessert - but this was so nice of him).<br>Needless to say, AGAIN ... very IMPRESSED.<br><br>I&#39;ve eaten here since then and I still love it.<br><br>I wake up every morning wishing I didn&#39;t have to be at work and could just go sit @ Toast.<br><br>What a lovely AND delicious place!	1
Pastrami sandwich is ok...i wouldn&#39;t go out of my way to come here...too pricey for a sandwich that is not all that filling or memorable.	0
This place has a real maritime feel that reminds me of the guy with the boat in jaws. I love that scene when Richard dryfus and the other dudes are drinking whiskey and telling stories about their scars. Anyways, the waiter was wearing a stupendously red striped t shirt which added to the experience. You just can&#39;t get amenities like this most places. And the bar has this soft cushion under the bar for your knees. Whew! I&#39;m always knockin&#39; my knees! If you love The song &#34;brandy you&#39;re a fine girl&#34; you&#39;ll love this spot! I subtract a star because a homeless guy kept staring into the window at my wine and oysters and fogging up the glass. Gross.	1
So , where should I begin. Lets start of by saying the food was ok, it was just ok, so its more like a meh . I ended up getting a Chicken Tinga Burrito, it didn't have a great unique flavor, i wasn't looking for authentic flavor, i understand what kind of place it is, but it should still have great taste. We were excited to try some tacos but you could only get them in groups of 2. So my partner requested a breakfast Bacon Avocado Burrito after knowing you could make a breakfast taco a breakfast burrito. When he asked the server what the burrito would come with the server said it was the same ingredients as the taco. So he ordered the burrito with no egg. The burrito came back with eggs and beans which wasn't mentioned on the menu and she did not mentioned when we asked her about the ingredients, my partner hates beans btw. So, the server came back and we politely reminded her that she did not mention the beans and that we did not want eggs on the burrito. So they took the burrito back.A second burrito came back and this one did not have egg, or beans luckily... However there was no BACON , not a bit of bacon. Just old potatoes and avocado. The server came to check on us and we politely told her about it, she asked us if we would like another burrito or just to take it off from the tap. We said no, my partner was very hungry and so was I. The "manager" brought out some bacon after we already had our bill. They ended up taking the breakfast burrito off the tap which is appreciated but overall there really isn't much to go back for. The 2 stars are for effort on fixing the problem and for the 1st round of chips and salsa, the 2nd round wasn't that good, the chips were very chewy. I really wanted to like like this place, it looks so hip . It just wasn't a good experience and the food wasn't great, it was plain and kind of boring for my taste.	0
If it were possible to award an eatery a negative value of stars, I would most certainly have given Border Grill a negative 10. <br><br>I arrived in the company of four other people, in the late afternoon after going to the Aquarium exhibit. We were all very hungry, and excited to get some Mexican food. We&#39;re from Texas, and thought it would be interesting to see how a Top Chef&#39;s award-winning Mexican food would measure up to the stellar Tex-Mex food to which we are accustomed. <br><br>Upon arrival, the hostess was cheery enough, if a bit of an airhead. After being seated, we waited a full five minutes before even being greeted by a server. Following a perfunctory greeting, we were brought chips and salsa (both lackluster and bland) and had to wait another 5 minutes for water. The waiter was nice enough, but seemed to be mostly unconcerned with giving us good service, or making a decent impression.<br><br>The menu itself was rather pricey. If you&#39;re at a place that charges $ 4.50 for a fish taco a la carte (with a tortilla the size of a drink coaster and an even smaller filet of Mahi Mahi), you know you won&#39;t be able to leave the restaurant without paying upwards of $ 25.00 per person/ per dish. The food is billed as &#34;Mexican&#34;, but there were no true Mexican dishes on the menu. Everything seemed to be more Central/ South American.<br><br>Let me preface my actual food review by saying that we waited a grand total of 35 minutes for our food to arrive. I was to the point of trying to eat our waiter, who had already conveniently disappeared. <br><br>I ordered the chile relleno burger, with paprika seasoned fries, and a fish taco a la carte. I asked for the burger rare, because 1) it cuts down on cooking time and I was ravenous, and 2) I simply cannot stand an overcooked, rubbery meat patty. <br>The other members of my party ordered 1) crab nachos 2) beef nachos 3) avocado tacos 4) chicken caesar salad. <br>1) The crab nachos were adequate. For a self-proclaimed &#34;grill&#34; specializing in seafood, the meat was rather bland and tasteless, and were downplayed by the plethora of toppings heaped upon the actual chip.<br>2)The beef nachos were already limp when they arrived at the table. The meat was wholly bland, and the kitchen chose to under-employ cheese, making the overall nacho rather boring.<br>3) The avocado tacos were a great disappointment. As said by the consumer of the food, the idea of the avocado tacos was excellent, but the actual execution of the taco was underwhelming. <br>4) The chicken caesar salad was probably the worst thing served. You might be questioning how in the world a kitchen can mess up that which is essentially chopped greens and a simple meat fillet. Well, when your &#34;caesar dressing&#34; is the taste and consistency of mayonnaise, and is literally drenching the salad, you tend to look unfavorably upon the dish. <br>5) My chile relleno burger was probably the best thing served. The burger was cooked to my standard, and the chile relleno itself was decent, if a bit bland. The fries were the only really yummy thing served, and I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s something a Mexican restaurant should be proud of. <br>6)The fish taco was terrible. The corn tortilla (while &#34;homemade&#34;) was bland and too thick, and the filet of Mahi Mahi was too thick, overcooked, and bland. The guacamole tasted like something you could get at the grocery store, and was heavily salted. <br><br>The overall really shocking thing to me was the lack of seasoning. The chefs behind the menu are award-winning and famed, but don&#39;t know how to use simple seasoning on their food to make it palatable. <br><br>The bill wound up being over $ 150.00 (when the checkbook finally made it to the table), and we paid up, left a tip, and got the hell out of there. I wound up with gastrointestinal issues later on that night. If you&#39;re looking for good Mexican food, I highly suggest going elsewhere. To give you an idea of how deeply disappointing this food was, I would suggest going to Taco Bell instead. At least there, you&#39;re only paying $.99 for a taco, and the diarrhea is cheaper.	0
Don't be afraid of the line!!! It is worth the wait and the line moves fast!!! Great Food, more than enough to eat!! Loved the pancakes!!	1
Given it proximity to my client&#39;s location, I decided to try this place for dinner. It was a weeknight, but this was packed. So, decided to sit at one of the tables out side the main dining area.<br><br>Waiter/Waitress were so slow in taking orders, and services. I ordered tagalitte bolognese. It was average at best and portion was bit small. I saw other table who ordered pizza. Pizza was pretty good portion. Should have ordered the pizza. But lack of service was pretty turn-off.<br><br>Service - 1.0<br>Food - 2.0<br>Ambiance - 2.0 because of loud noises	0
We were guests in the hotel and decided for the first evening to check out the restaurant. We had initially made a reservation for dinner and was told by our Concierge that we could sit in the main dining area and decide if we wanted the regular menu or the Happy Hour menu. Upon arriving at the restaurant we were told that we cannot have Happy Hour menu unless we are sitting at the lounge or bar area which was interesting as this was a definite conflict to what the Concierge had told us at check in. Unperturbed we decided to check out the food at this famous Happy Hour at Sazerac that people had raved about that goes until 8 pm! 	0
If you enjoy non-existent customer service and poor air ventilation then this is your place! Our party of 8 was seated immediately but it was all downhill from there. It was a warm Sunday late afternoon and it showed inside the restaurant. The ventilation was awful; it was hot and muggy when you saw down. Our orders were promptly taken thereafter. First, only 1 bowl came out initially. That took upwards of 30-45 minutes. Then our appetizers came after the second wave of bowls. The last bowl never showed so we had to inform our waiter who casually acknowledged that it was "forgotten". At that point, one would think that missing bowl would be expedited but we sat and watch as other bowls of ramen were served while the last bowl took another 20+ minutes. By the time the last bowl arrived, the rest of the table had finish. The waiter lacked any sense of urgency. Only a simple "sorry about that" at the end of a nearly one hour wait. One more customer service anecdote: apparently there was a waitlist after we arrived. There was a family of about 8 sitting outside waiting. One of the ladies had to peek her head in and ask the waiter about open tables because across the room, there were three tables wide open, without any patrons. The waiter/hostess didn't even bother to go out and follow up on the waitlist once guests were leaving. We also saw another angry party leave during our stay here. Of course, this can be all considered heresay.Finally. The ramen itself? It was alright. The broth is flavorful as advertised, not as salty as Orenchi. I ordered the Yamadaya bowl which was packed with 2 types of meats and eggs. The portions are definitely abundant. The ramen itself isn't as thick as Orenchi, however. Overall though, Orenchi is better Yamadaya.I am not returning here. One and done.	0
The good food and service are covered by everyone else - there&#39;s nothing else I can add to that so I&#39;ll leave that alone.<br><br>I&#39;ll review this from a different angle instead - the business info shows that it&#39;s not good for children. It&#39;s true from the menu standpoint - it doesn&#39;t have a kids menu like grilled cheese and chicken fingers, yet I wouldn&#39;t expect otherwise. Other than that, I thought it very kid friendly. Our server offered us bread for our toddler in case he was hungry while we waited for our meal to arrive. Another server brought him crayons and paper to doodle on. He was also given a complimentary scoop of homemade vanilla ice cream for dessert (which to my stomach&#39;s benefit, he was too full to finish).	1
Brand delivered an excellent experience once again. The 8oz filet mignon was cooked to perfection and the Bloody Mary was served strong and delicious. The service was spot on.	1
Wow, great food, cool scene, prompt service! Can't ask for much more! The food was simple yet succulent! We went here for my friends birthday and we had a feast of some fabulous nummies! Appetizer: Shrimp cocktail and oysters. I am a big fan of shrimp cocktail as a starter. You would think there isn't much to it and you really can't screw it up or make it any better. Wrong. This place had the most amazing shrimp cocktail appy I've ever seen! It was your basic shrimp, yes but with 3 different dipping sauces, topped off with a simple shrimp ceviche. It was amazing. The oysters were on point, mixed with a little cocktail sauce and this tasty little habanero sauce - yum!! All so good!Main Course: Short rib and Roasted chicken. The short rib was laid on top of a bed of barley with onions. To die for. The short rib was tender on the inside and a tad bit charred on the outside. De-lish. The Roasted chicken was out of control. It was tender and tasty but again, very simple. It comes with a side of this honey must ad sauce. It was so good!! Highly recommend both of these dishes. Sides (oh the sides): Brocollini, Dungeness Crab Mac and Cheese, Roasted Button Mushrooms. Need I say more? I'm not a huge huge fan of brocollini but however they made this one, I must know. It was the tastiest brocollini I've ever tasted. Again simple. The crab Mac and cheese; I mean do I even need to say more?! Absolutely delectable. I savored every bite! Roasted mushrooms were again I say, simple but cooked to perfection. Very lightly buttered (although I'm not opposed to having my mushrooms swim in butter) with light herbs. It was all so yummy!Dessert (friend's birthday): Hula pie. It's an ice cream pie with chocolate covered hazel nuts. Out. Of. Control. Service: the service was fun and on point! We love when waiters recommend certain dishes, but this guy....Omg, he was so into it. He sold us on every dish. His enthusiasm was hilarious and we enjoyed him so much. While the birthday boy went to the bathroom we asked for a cake to be sent out. So at the end of the meal, he asked if we wanted dessert and we said no thank you. And he gave my girlfriend this dorky look like "don't worry I got you". It was so great! His name was Brian. Thanks Brian. The managers of the place were all so helpful as well. It was such a great experience. Its tucked away in Playa Del Rey but they have all these little dive bars and restaurants around. All within walking distance. Such a fun little area.	1
This place sucks....I don&#39;t know how it has positive reviews.... I watched 2 of the Miami Heat ECF games there &amp; never again. I had read the positive reviews so decided to check it out. Went there &amp; sat at the bar. After a few minutes sitting there (what I learned later was) the owner walks up &amp; asked what I wanted to drink (in a not so friendly manner). I said a sprite since I was on antibiotics, I got a bad look...he gives me my can of sprite &amp; a Styrofoam cup (yeah, not even a real plastic cup)....anyways, after a bit I decided to order 10 wings, he looks at me &amp; says &#34;that&#39;s it?&#34; again, with a crappy attitude....well, wings were pretty undercooked, actually grossed me out....my friend showed up &amp; after almost half an hour he finally came &amp; got the drink order.....which I had to remind him of 10 minutes later. Order some onion rings &amp; they also sucked....I really don&#39;t know how the food has gotten good reviews.<br><br>We went back for another game a few days later, I figured I&#39;d give it another shot....well the place was packed this time (Gm. 6 of the ECF) &amp; the owner actually looked pissed that the place was packed &amp; he had to work so hard. He was quickly stopping people outside &amp; telling them that he was full &amp; there were no seats....never seen a business owner get upset because he has business.....I was able to sit outside where I could watch the game, but not once did anyone go outside to see if we wanted anything to drink or eat (which was a blessing to me, since I really didn&#39;t want to give my money to this place). In fact he walked out once, saw that someone had left an empty pitcher on the table we were sitting at &amp; tried to get me to pay for it.....yeah, good luck.....<br><br>If you want a good spot, with GREAT service &amp; good food, hit Hurricane Grill &amp; wings on Bird Rd. &amp; 142, or even the Keg South of Kendall on 128th St &amp; 136 Ave...Any place is better than this place. You&#39;ve been warned.	0
This place is awesome. I'm officially making myself a regular! Nate, my waiter, was so attentive, helpful, and friendly and he made my experience here amazing! I love the vibe here and the service and draft beers are definitely above par! This place made me feel like I was family!	1
So, caveat for my review: I'm Southern. I hold any self-styled Southern &/or soul food restaurant to higher expectations and after heading to Hard Knox for a Sunday brunch, post-Saturday night out with some friends there wasn't much to impress me. Corn muffins reminded me of these faux corn muffins that tasted more like cake that my college dining hall used to serve. Chicken and waffles were okay, mac 'n' cheese was eh, typical brunch food was also pretty eh. Mostly I ordered my food and felt sad and disappointed by my cold eggs, bacon, and unseasoned grits. It was an important life lesson in being skeptical about California born-and-raised friends' Southern food recommendations.I'd give the other location a try (I've heard it's better?) but it wouldn't be one of the first places I'd tell a friend to head to. Regardless, loved the funky decor and the staff was super friendly. Enjoy!	0
Although pricey, the brunch at Cafe Fleuri was fantastic!  They had every type of brunch food you could possibly imagine.  All of the wait staff was very friendly and the food was fantastic (which was surprising for a buffet style).  I would highly recommend going for a special occasion.  No need to have lunch or dinner after eating here.  :)  The fondue fountain was very impressive as well.	1
The food and wine were Las Vegas expensive, as you would expect from a celebrity chef restaurant.  Unfortunately the quality of the food was horribly underwhelming -- by far the worst of any of the celebrity chef restaurants that I've visited across the country.  The DOCG Pizza was overly salty and lacked much other flavor.  The PICI Pasta also lacked the duck and truffle flavor advertised on the menu.The only positive was the service.  Our waiter, Travis, was attentive and made sure that things moved along smoothly so we could enjoy dinner and finish up in time to make it to a show later that evening.	1
Flawless. We were waited upon like royalty and fed similarly. The scene is casual, warm, and elegant. Must try: the crab tartare, the burrata salad (I could have slept on the cheese; it was so light and airy), the scallops, and the tiramisu (multi-layered, garnished with gold fakes, served with candied cherries.) Portions are NORMAL-sized (unlike its predecessor, Lippi, Tamarina understands not everyone has a gastric-bypass-sized stomach.) I can definitely see the place morphing from cozy business happy hour lounge to evening fine dining without all the pomp of other nice restos.	1
The vibe at this place is really cool---hip atmosphere---really nice ambiance. So, why then the one star? Well if I could give less I would. So---hands down as I said this place has a really cool vibe. BUT---the food was just OK. Why then the one star one begs to know? A waiter was taking salads to the bar and brushed my wife's head. She said "my hair is damp---that salad touched my hair" We debated at our table whether to bring this up---and our integrity and ethics won out. We informed our female waitress of this to which she said "well----its probably best not to do anything about it" The three of us were shocked---and I must admit my imagination ran wild over what else may be "acceptable" not to address. Regardless---my wife's salmon was a 5, my short ribs a three---my friends pork loin a 5, the pork belly a 1. Appetizers were very good. Shrimp boil was actually awesome---and the fried green tomatoes (which I never had) were great too. Too bad we experienced what we did---shows how staff can affect the overall experience---which is a shame. We'll pass this one by in the future....	0
4 out of 8 of their marinated pork dishes were pretty blend and tasteless. The only ones that I thought were marinated properly are: spicy, miso, curry and herbs. <br>Service was excellent. <br>Side dishes were limited, but tasted good. <br>They also come with a complimentary seafood soup. <br>So definitely right on the price. But still, I don&#39;t think I will come back again.	0
Run of the mill pub.	1
Hands down my favorite place to get sushi. I haven't gotten sick there, had inconsistent service or felt "out of place". It's great. I have nothing bad to say about ever coming here!	1
Sadly the one in Rowland Heights is CLOSED :(But that never stops me from going to one in LA if i really wanted to LOL.Original or Spicy everything is Awesomeness! Try the spicy once just so u know how u can tolerate it , need LOTS OF WATER.The PICKLED RADISH is sooo good too! Eat them together.	1
Perfect restaurant! Lovely atmosphere, great svc by all, yummy food, and it&#39;s tucked away off the street which, once inside, makes u feel like u found a secret little spot in a treehouse lol. <br><br>I recommend everyone go and give it a chance! I&#39;m glad I did, I&#39;ll be back.	1
I tried their banana,Nutella and coconut crepe &amp; thought it was delicious! The coffee was also very good. The inside is small,but very cozy and the wood counter was lovely. The people who worked there were all very nice to myself and the person I was with. I&#39;ll definitely go again!	1
First time eating at this particular location. Ordered a pupusa revuelta. Very tasty.	1
the food was EXCELLENT. I got the Mardi Gras Pasta and my husband got the stuffed crab platter. Both were really great	1
Took 20+ minutes for 2 dishes to come out. Pancakes were ice cold. America&#39;s Most Wanted a Breakfast Sandwich was made with sub-par meat, overpowering cheese, and served with flavorless potatoes. (Also came out luke-warm) They forgot to bring out our coffee twice. Only &#34;redeeming&#34; quality was the lemonade. Definitely not returning.	0
The only saving grace for this place is their grilled chicken. Had a prawn burrito earlier that was basically a veggie burrito outside of two bites. When calling in the order, I was placed on hold for 5 minutes, but could still hear chat going on that had nothing to do with taking an order. Disappointed and won't be back.	0
Worse service ever! I waited for my food about 20 min then I got my chuzo desgranado and was cold. I asked my waitress for the cilantro sauce and she forgot about it. After 20 min she came to the table blaming some one else for not getting the sauce. This is my second bad experience in la moon! I&#39;m not coming back	0
I am ashamed to admit it (at the risk of sounding like, so LA...) but I am officially addicted to their kale salad. The dressing is delicious and zippy, and the gouda and hazelnuts add just the right balance of textures &amp; flavors. The octopus dish is also delicious, as well as the house made ricotta. They have a killer cocktail menu to supplement the delicious food...and the service has been great every time I&#39;ve been here (I expected much more snobbery and was oh so pleasantly surprised). It really doesn&#39;t seem like a &#39;hotel restaurant&#39;. <br><br>Enjoy a drink, some kale, and some excellent people watching. And don&#39;t forget to make a stop up at the rooftop bar :)	1
This place would be great if they just lost their attitude. Food is amazing. Service sucks. Every time I&#39;ve been here the server always has some kind of issue. Spent almost $40 on lunch and needed to do some work during my lunch break. Asked what the wi-fi PW was because they had two networks. RHLP Office and RHLP. The server said they don&#39;t give out the PW because it was for office use only. Really? I just spent $40 on lunch and you can&#39;t offer me free wifi? Pretty fucking lame and inconsiderate. Hell, McDonald&#39;s has free wifi. Whatever, I won&#39;t be going back.	0
Another great hidden restaurant in the college corridor. You know you&#39;re in for some cheap eats when there&#39;s a place around the college. The food here is really good and seasoned just right. Everyone is friendly and treat you like family (good side of the family, not the cousin in prison side). I highly recommend coming here, shrimp burrito, super chicken burrito, carne asada taco, potatoe taco, fish taco, chicken nachos, and fish n chips washed down with deep fried Oreos. Everyone here all thumbs up from the crew. Highly recommend!!	1
Halal food truck quality food, but half the size and double the price. Nice interior but no serves nor friendly smile.	0
This review is based on my last visit to Local 360 and only the food, because the staff and cleanliness of the location is still top notch. The food however tasted like it was reheated and cooked with oils that had been used for over a week. My burger was chewy and without any flavor, the fries looks like they had been cooked twice over blackened and soggy, the steak frites was equally as bad as the burger, the soda tastes like it came from a Sodastream and the fried pumpkin seeds were, as always, delicious. At least there were the pumpkin seeds -- the most expensive fried pumpkin seeds I've paid for since most of the other food wasn't fully consumed.	0
We loved Roberta&#39;s so much we celebrated a milestone birthday there . . .once upon a (very recent) time. Sadly, specials seem to no longer exist and the menu is seriously truncated as a result. ALSO, it&#39;s no longer BYOB so get ready to cough up cash for a very ordinary wine list. The lamb breast is quite succulent and very fatty if you need to soak up booze, and the pizzas are still good, but overall this place tarnished far too quickly. Bonus: very friendly and efficient waitstaff.	0
Right outside of Playhouse nightclub, this place is a perfect spot to grab a bite if you're not craving the pizza next door. They built a food truck right into the space! The artwork and decorations give it a fun vibe. Any taco you get here is really good, but my favorites are the carne asada and fish tacos. The guacamole is good, but way too expensive for the amount they give you. The churros are pretty yummy too. Stop by if you're wandering around Hollywood Blvd looking for something to soak up the alcohol.	1
As Winston Churchill once said of Russia, " One cannot forecast to you the action of Russia. It is a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma; but perhaps there is a key. That key is Russian national interest." Someone this reminds me a this place. Hip though in a time warp. Out of place, yet perfect for the hood. Menu confuses the hell out of me, yet is always so good to taste when it comes out in one form or another. So, been here now 2x and the food is just darn good. From the little Italian treats, to the New Orleans "mardi gras" tasting menu, to the burgers, to the amazing almost home fries. I just dunno what the hell goes on here. The service is always bizarre, yet good. The martini's come in this mini glass made for a Barbie color forms set. The tables can be great or truly bizarre. I am even confused writing this review but I know one thing. I will be back, often and as I think Winston Churchill says, "I'll have another" or "I just began to fight." Or something like that. Or was that Neidemyer.	1
Who knew I'd ever like brussel sprouts? Not me - and certainly not my mom! Enter Little Bear, with the tastiest batch of sprouts I've ever not turned my nose up to. In fact everything I've tried here, I've liked. Favorites being the farro salad, (the farro burger falls apart, but still tastes good), that carb-monster mac and cheese, parmesan potato chips and stilton grilled cheese sandwich. Their brunch is also good - great pancake and waffle choices. The only thing that kinda bugged me about this place was despite the number of times my husband and I eat here, now that we live within walking distance, nobody ever remembered us as locals. One of the things that I looked forward to being a DTLA resident was that knowing nod from local businesses. Like we shared something special in our zipcode. I wasn't looking for a NORM!-like greeting, but some recognition that we eat here all the time. That's when Jensen (sp?) came bounding toward us. Not only did she remember us, she asked how our place was coming together and then asked if we wanted our usual starters: brussel sprouts and parmesan chips. What a doll! All smiles the whole time.	1
One of the nicest places for a quick meal. We have eaten at the cafe (a very simple and small setting) and the service was commendable..friendly people who offer good recommendations! And we have also ordered food home and been happy with the delivery.we have almost tried everything (vegetarian) at this place and been very satisfied with the taste abs the quality.. definitely can&#39;t miss appreciating the reasonable pricing on all their items.. our current fave! :-)	1
With a rise in obesity and a focus on the healthy diets of other cultures; one can embrace the food of the Hindu people being that they stick to a meatless diet. This vegetarian fare is perfect for the health-conscious eaters in Silver Lake. Welcome Samosa House - a hit on the West Side newly laying foundations on the East Side.<br><br>Samosa House sits on prime real estate in the heart of Silver Lake (formerly Dusty&#39;s Bistro which I had also enjoyed) and can&#39;t be missed with an exterior covered in bright paint and stunning henna designs. Parking is tricky in this area (isn&#39;t all of Silver Lake?), however Samosa House is creating a small lot across the street next to a mechanic shop. <br><br>We were welcomed to a soft opening (April 27th. Grand Opening is May 1st) to loud Bollywood music to try some of Samosa House&#39;s goodies. That&#39;s right! Free food for all, no questions asked! This definitely set a precedent and shows how much Samosa House cares about the community in which they are setting out to establish themselves. Shockingly, the line was short and service was faster than many restaurants which have been around forever. The interior was a bit bland with strong wooden accents combining elements of Indian decoration meets Silver Lake hipster, but was lacking any ambiance or special details. This may be spruced up as Samosa House makes tracks after the first few weeks. <br><br>How was the food? Samosa House didn&#39;t skimp on offering tasty morsels with Chana Masala (a classic chickpea recipe), jackfruit curry, soy chicken Tikka Masala, Sarson ka Saag (mustard greens but tastes like spinach paneer), and roasted cucumber with white rice. For a vegetarian, I found everything to be delicious. The Smoked Cauliflower was DIVINE and a must-try while the Tikka Masala&#39;s sauce was heavenly. The Sarson ka Saag is also a hit in my book. The jackfruit was so-so but it isn&#39;t for everyone. The great thing? Much of Samosa House&#39;s offerings are not only vegetarian but vegan, as well. Overall, I thought the food could have used a bit more spice but I like things saturated in flavor. It should be noted that the food tasted even better the next day (I kept my plate for the following day), as the notes of spices soaked in even better.<br><br>Service was enjoyable. There was a slight language barrier and the employees weren&#39;t very talkative but they were accommodating and said, &#34;Yes&#34; to all requests. This is another factor which strongly adds to the growth of their representation of a new business (in a positive way). <br><br>In other notes, the bathrooms are one-person usage so lines may form at times and there is outdoor seating for those who want to enjoy people-watching the crazies in Silver Lake.<br><br>Samosa House is a nice vegetarian, cafeteria-style eatery to add to the plethora of restaurants in Silver Lake. Fast and semi-healthy (minus the creams and oils and whatnot in the curries); Samosa House is surely going to be a mainstay in Silver Lake. Check it out!	1
Yummy, fast delivery!	1
This place doesn&#39;t look like much (just a little bigger than your typical every-street-corner-in-nyc convenience store), but they make a mean sandwich. I had melted Munster on roast beef with some peppers, etc, but I felt like I was eating a Philly cheese steak. In Philadelphia. Amazing.<br><br>Cons: there are &#34;too many choices&#34;, and the sandwiches are &#34;too big&#34; :)	1
My husband and I tried this restaurant last night. The service staff was kind and helpful though the food left much to be desired. The roasted duck was really greasy and salty. The chicken and broccoli combo platter was OK, but not good. We both left hungry and felt sick to our stomachs later in the evening.	0
Would have rated it higher but due to the fact that service was not up to par had to rate it lower.  When you are paying the prices charged at this establishment they should be much more attentive.  Wine was great - too pricey even for the benefit of having a wine sommelier. Loved that aspect, but paying $195 for a $35 bottle is just too much :/	1
I just want to say this is an edit. My first time here I didn't give the pizza a chance because of not having a veggie option except for cheese and I was probably being a real pain but staff was great. I did go back after the owner reached out and well first of all the pizza was delicious second, I admire the owner reaching out to customers makes customers loyal. And I'm so happy I gave it a second chance.	1
Finally a neighborhood Chinese restaurant that is worthy of 5 stars. The food, the service, and the desire to please its patrons is very evident. Andy our server was always available for any of our requests. The host Jack took boasting rights making it very clear that all menu items were family secret recipes. <br>Jack assisted us with our selections of which all were excellent. I look forward to becoming a loyal customer to this fine restaurant.	1
My friend and i were scoping midtown out for some vegetarian friendly options. First choice was Proof Pizza, but since the line was out the door, spris was our next option. <br>In a nutshell, I was not overly impressed. <br>The cashier seemed a bit impatient. And the chicken on my mango salad was very dry. Even my veggie friend commented on how dry it looked. The pizza we ordered was, albeit good (truffle oil is always amazing), it was a bit greasy. The crust, flimsy.<br>I will most likely pass on Spris in midtown on my next visit.	0
Every time I come here I get the volcano roll. It&#39;s the best I&#39;ve ever had. In fact, I generally hate volcano rolls due to the immense amount of pure mayo they top the sushi with but this one is not your average volcano roll. It&#39;s made with spicy mayo and it&#39;s just delicious. Pretty good fried rice, although not the best. I once tried the fried rice with meat and it didn&#39;t taste like high quality meat. Overall, things are very fresh and delicious. Not that quick regarding wait time.	1
Addicted.<br><br>Great food, amazing coffee and super friendly staff. I eat breakfast and lunch here multiple times a week and it&#39;s consistently great.<br><br>Try the Moroccan Scramble with no bread and no meat.	1
Not that great. All I tasted was lemon as the BBQ sauce. Baby Back Blues in Plainfield Il. is sooooo much better. It is worth the drive.	0
So good!!! Margaritas are the bomb.octopus taco is a must!! And Brussels sprouts to tickle your fancy!! Super accommodating with reservations or lack of.:) I'll be back for sho! However the kale chip n cauliflower nachos was great but tell them heavier on the kale. #pickledonions	1
Amazing food!<br>Very happy they are back I have been going here for 20 years...<br>Love this place. <br>Highly recommend.	1
I was looking on yelp for a wine bar, close to home, where I can sit with my girlfriends indulging on some fine wine and cheese platters. Thank you yelp for giving me the pleasure to find this gem. Loved the ambience, Natassia our server was so inviting and knowledgeable which made our experience that much better. We shared 3 bottles of wine and 3 platters including the salmon and Brie, Mediterranean and Spanish. All 3 were excellent choices. Went on a Wednesday night and live music was playing, made it my favorite time of the week!	1
Service here is impeccable. The waiters/waitresses are very knowledgeable about the menu as well as their beer list. If you&#39;re not sure of what beer you want, they&#39;re even willing to let you sample a couple to help you decide.<br><br>The burgers are competitive in both taste and price with top LA burger joints (Umami, Father&#39;s Office, The Counter, etc.) and you HAVE to order the wasabi fries which are addictive like crack but not nearly as bad for you. <br><br>The bartenders here also pretty renowned and can make you custom drinks based on your preferences. <br><br>Two big thumbs up for Far Bar!	1
Fat kids paradise! <br>The pizza here is so amazingly good. I mean, seriously delicious stuff!<br>Service is prompt and friendly, and there&#39;s always tons of parking available. They even have a space that looks like it could easily be set aside for a bridal/ baby shower or any other type of private event.	1
Gilbert's main street has a nice location for a sunny seattle day . Food was not dissapointing but was over priced .	0
I brought home a bowl of pho for my under-the-weather wife and she loved it. Haven't been disappointed there yet.	1
I will never go back. Nothing positive about this place or the service. The make you wait for everything. If you want a good ceviche go to Ceviche 105 they treat with respect. Never never go back.	0
I&#39;ve avoided making a Yelp account for years but the delivery guy at Purgatory went so far and above that I made one. They forgot to pack our Coca Cola and the guy went to 7Eleven to get us one. That&#39;s what I call customer service. AND, the pizza is always amazing.	1
Prime Quarter used to be a great steakhouse - especially for large groups. After not having been there in a year or so, my husband and I stopped in on a Friday night. We should have taken the hint that the place was nearly empty, and though multiple staff members were milling around, it took over 10 minutes for someone to ask if we wanted to be seated. Our drink order was incorrect right off the bat. Who orders a Captain &amp; Mt. Dew? The meat selection was lackluster, and the quality was not what it once was. My husbands sirloin almost fell apart while cooking and the filet I chose was so oddly cut that it was almost impossible to cook evenly. I had ordered mushrooms to go with my steak, and my husband onions and mushrooms. I don't recall ever having spit out food in a restaurant until I took a bite of the mushrooms. It was like eating a handful of dirt. My husband thought I was overreacting due to the fact I was not thrilled at that point, so he took a bite of mine. They also ended up in a napkin. His combo with onions was fine, but I couldn't even continue eating my dinner because the taste in my mouth was so aweful. We asked for to-go boxes and our check at that point, paid and left. We definately will not be returning any time soon. It's too bad. With some interior updates, quality ingredients and a staff that cared just a little bit, it could be a great place again.	1
No! NONONONONO!!!<br><br>I felt sick within the first three bites. Which was unfortunately AFTER I gave my dog two pieces of the chicken. Guess who got sick first? Trick question! It was a simultaneous combustion.<br><br>The beans were crunchy, it was MOSTLY rice, and the remaining ingredients were in a teeny sliver down the center. So really it was just a rivet hell ball that was almost as unenjoyable going in as it was coming out.<br><br>I also spent 30 minutes in the fetal position this morning. So, you know, that was fun.	0
The burgers are marginal and the service is down right rude. King's does have two skee ball tables and an outdoor patio which is fun in the summer but I just can't get over how unfriendly the staff is. I have been going there every Wednesday for close to 2 years (since my friend like it) and they are still unfriendly. I just don't understand that. Now that the Loft is open just down the street I won't be going back to King's.	0
Until I found The Roost, I was never really a big fried chicken fan. Forget Popeyes, McDonald&#39;s and any other place that claims they have good chicken. THE ROOST is the place to go!!<br><br> As soon as I go back to college, I&#39;m going to miss it so much, but I know that every time I come home, it will be my first stop to eat!	1
They used to have karaoke, but not anymore. There's no point of going here now. I recommend you go somewhere else.	0
What happen , I didn&#39;t come eat here for 3 months to find they have lost quality , guess they got too popular , they even raised their price, it was $3.75 now $5.50 for pan de bisteak like woah slow down their ! I&#39;m sad to say that they are not so good any more I am a regular and usually gave them 5stars but no more. I went 3times to give them a chance but yes I confirm this claim.	0
Ordered two burgers and a greek &#34;wedge&#34; salad. The burgers were (barely) palatable, albeit dry. The bun was soggy and completely squished. The real crime, however, was the &#34;wedge&#34; salad... it was a mess of limp field greens a a bit of iceberg lettuce that looked as if it had been chopped three days ago... it was all brown around the edges. The salad was overdressed... how they get off calling it a wedge salad is beyond me... <br><br>If you&#39;re looking for fast casual, go to Naf Naf next door or Protein bar across the street.	0
Went here for dinner with the family and we were all impressed. Service was great, our waiter was very helpful. Food was incredible. Perfect place to relax and enjoy a great meal.	1
When you find a nice restaurant in an off-the-strip casino, it is a good day. Austin's is such a place. Nice space with good sound insulation so you're not listening to the slot machines in the casino which is just outside the door. The menu is what you'd expect from a steakhouse, without the prices you'd expect from a Las Vegas steakhouse. I had the NY strip and it was tasty, tender and cooked the way I asked for it. My dinner companion had the diver scallops in a beure blanc. They were tender, not gritty and the sauce was to die for.We head a noise table nearby which was the only distraction from an otherwise, lovely meal.	1
Told it would be a 45 minute wait. Ordered a bottle of wine while we waited. Were repeatedly told just a few more minutes. After 2 HOURS we were still waiting and offered anything to compensate. I've been here before. Not worth waiting any longer for mediocre food and service. I will never eat here again.	0
Look, there's not a lot of complexity to The Apple Pan. You walk in the door, usually wait a few minutes for a spot at the counter, then sit down and eat. But this is a beautiful thing. What you're getting when you go inside is a handful of tasty handmade burger options served simply and with tremendous efficiency. Don't let that sound like faint praise, however, because this place is fantastic. Everything is wonderfully tasty, served in an atmosphere of 1940s/50s nostalgia. Get the hickory burger and a piece of pie--you won't be disappointed.	1
Anyone coming to Vegas would easily be overwhelmed by all the fancy Italian restaurants situated at the heart of many 5-star strip resort casinos where the average per-person expenditure runs easily upward of $100. <br><br>But if you don&#39;t mind a cheap $10 cab fair or a short 5 min drive from the strip, come here to enjoy authenticate Italian food with large portion, flavorfully delicious and reasonable prices.<br><br>On my most recent visit, I had linguine with fresh clams in white sauce and my friend had Chicken Masala; and they both are exceptional, plus.. 2 orders of Lasagnas to go. Total bills were still less than $100.<br><br>Service is quick and the staff are friendly. Highly Recommended !!	1
Great fajitas and taco selections.  Best tequila bar in town	0
I&#39;m the kind of guy that can get a kick out of sitting on a sidewalk curb, and as long as the company I&#39;m keeping is nice to be around, I&#39;m satisfied. <br><br>Could have been the Wednesday night I went, could&#39;ve been the lack of air conditioning going on, could&#39;ve been the bartender mixing drinks right in my face, or it could&#39;ve been the really, loud, obnoxious, too-drunk-to-even-try-bang girls sitting next to me, but I really didn&#39;t like this place. <br><br>There was a live band, old guys - bald yet pony-tailed (how the hell does that happen?) - but I couldn&#39;t hear what they were playing because one chick was screaming in the ear of another chick about how much she loved and and would ask her to be her maid of honor at her wedding once she finds the right kind of guy who makes the right amount of money and who can handle her. <br><br>This isn&#39;t Far Bar&#39;s fault. When it comes to drinking, it&#39;s a methodical meditation for me. Far Bar just isn&#39;t conducive for that. <br><br>The layout was cool. An alley to provide the &#39;feel&#39; of being a true drunk. But that&#39;s about it. <br><br>Two stars for right now. Maybe if I go on another day, and if those girls are cramming for their finals, I might have a better experience. <br><br>Until then, Cosmo&#39;s it is.	0
A few friends and I ate dinner here the other night and had a horrible experience. First, I was about 10 minutes late and they wouldn&#39;t sit the remainder of our party, even though we were going to sit in a booth/bench style table and one member was 6 months pregnant. They made them stand literally next to the table until I arrived, when we were then &#34;allowed&#34; to sit down. If this is restaurant policy, the host can still use their brain when enforcing rules. <br><br>Secondly, the food was only average and over-priced. We had two orders of kale salad (very salty), shrimp salad (shrimp was completely raw inside), and two fish entrees, one being a special, which were both ok. The two white wines I had were both cheap tasting and sweet (and I ordered the dry options). <br><br>Lastly, the service was terrible. One server was completely robotic, whereas the other server forgot our sides and then actually argued with us when we asked about them, saying that we ordered them with the robot waitress. Only when he flipped back through his pad and saw that he had written down the sides did he relent. <br><br>DO NOT GO HERE!! I literally do not have one good thing to say about this restaurant, and with other great farm fresh type cuisine, this one is definitely not worth the cost.	0
Umm it just wasn&#39;t what I expected it to be at all! After reading the reviews to this place I was expecting culinary talent and after the experience I felt like I had been tricked. First of all and foremost the service was awful at 8:00 pm on a Friday night. To get service was kinda like looking for a whale on a whale excursion, you barely saw him aka waiter. I got my appetizer with my dinner because he forgot to enter it in the computer, I find that amateur and should never happen! All the entrees were just lacking in overall flavor. Nothing came close to setting it over the top and we all have had way better for the money. The fried oysters set on grits, dates with bacon (hard to mess up) and fries with garlic aoli (hard to mess up) were the best part of the dinner and were good. I was with three people and all three of us are not snobby or make much money but we all thought this place was a sheep dressed in wolfs clothing ...we were not impressed at all. Another example was my brothers dish which was the gnocchi ...it came out BURNT. He&#39;s a cook at Girl and the Goat and when he asked them about it they said it&#39;s supposed to taste like toast. Really? Burnt Toast? I don&#39;t think so. If it weren&#39;t for the BYOB feature and awesome location I would think that this place wouldn&#39;t survive anywhere else in the city. It was a big let down because due to the ratings I thought I was in for a treat but was definitely mistaken.	0
Super cute, local cafe with tons of yummy treats! Dough donuts and almond paste filled croissants, need I say more???	1
Bummer! I read such awesome reviews that I was really, really looking forward to checking this place out. If you are vegetarian, they have very few options. If you&#39;re vegan, they have none! Well, I guess you could get chips or fries. <br><br>I ended up getting the cheese sandwich and fries. The cheese sandwich was overpowered by blue cheese and something about the combo of cheeses made it taste like I was eating a mayo sandwich. The fries came with 4 sauces, but none of them were particularly good besides the ketchup. Kind of a gross lunch and not one I would ever want to eat again.<br><br>So, go here if you eat meat or drink beer then I&#39;m sure you will be happy. But, don&#39;t bring your vegetarian friends. They&#39;ll thank you for it.	0
This place is AMAZING! Every time I go I place large orders and they always come out perfect. The lobster is cooked to perfection and they don&#39;t skimp on it. If you don&#39;t know what to pick the person at the register can help you pick something. ... It takes a little because they obviously have to cook the lobster but it&#39;s worth the wait, always cooked to perfection. So good!!	1
All though I have had the opportunity to eat at Annie's before, this was the first time I got to eat on the new patio with my 4 legged babies.  The service was outstanding, the food was outstanding and my dogs loved their ice cream and biscuits.  The stuffed mushrooms are excellent.  Can't wait to go back again!	1
I don&#39;t know why people are complaining that the burgers here are &#34;just as good&#34; or &#34;only a little better&#34; than In-N-Out. IN-N-OUT IS DELICIOUS, PEOPLE. Thus, by the transitive property, the Apple Pan&#39;s burgers are also delicious. So are their fries and pies. Does In-N-Out serve pie? I didn&#39;t think so.	1
My kids love this place! Will be back soon, for sure!	1
Thoroughly disappointing as someone who used to love this place... We loved their lobster role, oysters and albacore crisps. They have dumbed down their good food and lost touch with the little things that used to make them great. I&#39;ve also sat and watched their corner cutting through the window to the kitchen and was justifiably discouraged.<br><br>The worst part is that you can&#39;t even call when you are on your way to put your name on this &#39;list&#39;. They never had a &#39;we&#39;ll text you policy&#39; before so why now. Honestly, you can wait up to 2 hours for a text but have to show up to put your name on the list (really infuriating if you ask me)<br><br>Overall, what was great is no more. Get the dollar oysters that&#39;s about all that&#39;s still worth it.	0
This is hands down the best cafe in downtown LA. Tucked away in the SCIArc campus, the twins who run the place are professional, extremely friendly, and take high pride in the food and drinks they prepare. Highly highly recommended. Awesome coffees, great unique selection of drinks and snacks, and their sandwiches are out of control.	1
I&#39;m always a fan of businesses active &amp; on top of their Yelp / social media. Luna Park is one of those. The owner Peter came up to us &amp; we talked about their Yelp deal! Especially in LA, its always a great feeling to learn that the owner really does care about your experience in their restaurant. This is a rare quality. <br><br>If it&#39;s your first time, you must try the Mussels &amp; Frites and the El Camerone Pizza. They have a really outstanding Happy Hour 2 for 1 Appetizers &amp; Drinks till 7pm on weekdays. You can&#39;t beat that! <br><br>I NEED to try dessert next time!!!	1
I was lucky enough to try good stuff eatery on opening day. I had very high hopes...I love burgers and fries. When we got there the line was very long- to be expected. The people taking our order in line were nice- we had a couple special requests and everything came out just right even amidst the chaos of opening day. <br><br>The actual burger was really greasy. Not my thing. It was a good burger- at this point it just needed a new bun. Fries were OK. The &#34;dip bar&#34; is a good concept. Oreo shake was excellent.	1
Went to Delancey on Wednesday of their 2nd 'real' week. Purposely we arrived as close to opening (5pm) as possible - we arrived about 5	1
"C'MON FELLAS, LET'S GET IT TOGETHER." The shout at me and my friend from the guy behind the deli counter defines my visit, and if it's not his job to keep track of orders, then I may be in the wrong deli. Rewind about an hour and this trip to Canter's had perfect bookends of terrible service. It began with a waiter who seldom visited our table (and served cold, unseasoned food), and it ended with the deli counter guy yelling at my friend and me because I tried to pick up both of our orders with both of us standing there together. How is that confusing, deli man?I also heard this place has a lot of history. Next time I'm looking for history, I think I'll head to a museum.	0
The visit to this restaurant was motivated by an experience that a group of us had while visiting NY (see my review for Joe's Shanghai). And the dumplings weren't bad but I wouldn't say they were better than JS's. Also the place itself is a real hole in the wall. Most of the other dishes were just OK. Actually towards the end of the meal we decided to order another round of the dumplings and then we saw something that made us change our minds but the waitress told us it was too late, the order was in. I'm still looking for a "King" of Shanghai Dumplings in SF. P.S. what's the deal with them trying to off-load those pastries covered in powdered sugar? They're not complimentary.	0
Great vibe. Food was great!!	1
New location same great food. Check them out at http	1
This is a great hole in the wall (literally) place to go for another nice brunch outdoors or some late night drinks. The Sapporo braised tacos are to die for and the burgers / sliders are freaking amazing. This has become I go to place whenever I want to impress some friends with a new bar or eatery. The service could be a little bit faster, but all in all, everytime I've gone here has made for a good experience.	1
Customer service is lacking at this La Carreta. I sat at the counter and it took a good five minutes for someone to come around and offer me a menu. On top of that, I never received the customary buttered Cuban toast until I requested it after my order was served. The food was just average and nothing spectacular. If you are looking for good Cuban cuisine, I suggest that you try Luis Galindo&#39;s Latin American on SW 8th St. and 57th Ave.	0
I like it. Feels very authentic Korean.	1
Ever had one of those cravings for a certain something during lunch, and you know that unless you find that certain something, you just won&#39;t feel satisfied?<br><br>I&#39;m not sure why, but I needed a turkey sandwich. So I yelped everything around my office and found this place.I&#39;ve been at this plaza sooo many times, but always missed this place. Read the great reviews (especially the praise about spam musubi) and was off.<br><br>As soon as you walk through the door, you&#39;re greeted with a hello and a smile. The son (assuming he&#39;s the son based on other reviews, mentioning it&#39;s a father/son establishment) was extremely welcoming, took the time to go into detail with all the questions i had, recommended a few things, and was just very friendly.<br><br>Everything sounded great, but I wouldn&#39;t budge on my turkey sandwich. I also grabbed myself a spam musubi based on the reviews.<br><br>The sandwich was very filling and tasty, but the spam musubi stole the spotlight. The rice was perfectly cooked, the spam was nicely browned, the egg/onions layer was a phenomenal addition, and the hot sauce (not sriracha) gave it that perfect kick. ($2-3... I don&#39;t remember,) Since that day I have stopped by multiple times and made that bad boy my lunch. I&#39;m telling you... it was I N C R E D I B LE!!!<br><br>They start making them around 9am or so, and they only make a certain amount, so please leave me one or two! Don&#39;t be stingy!!<br><br>P.S. You guys forgot to charge me for a soda last time. I owe you $!	1
After all the hype, my good friend and I decided to try Rolling Smoke. He had the Big daddy and I went for the two meat, ribs and brisket. This is my standard order and meal comparison for BBQ. Neither of us said we would come back.<br>Ribs were bland and dry, as was the brisket. One side of mashed potatoes actually was cold in a few bites. Sad to say, one of the worst BBQ meals I&#39;ve had in Vegas and anywhere. 1 1/2 stars and not sure that&#39;s worth it.	0
Meh? That's all I feel for Diablo. Overpriced for such small tacos. My friend and I both had 2 lobster tacos (which are teeny tiny) and potato skin. It was nearly 50 bucks.And they give you paper plates, not that i'm some sort of snob but if you are charging that much for a teeny taco at least give me a real plate? The lobster in the taco was delish but there wasn't much more then lettuce on ours?I really liked the interior and the girl at the counter was SUPER sweet and helpful.	0
The best Italian Restaurant in Seattle !	1
Super delicious cuban food - we get delivery from here all the time. The appetizer sampler is a ton of food for two people and is so yummy. We usually get that and try one new thing. The only issue is that they only deliver until 7:30pm, I think, and we usually don&#39;t decide what we want for dinner until close to that time. =/	1
Food is what most recommend of this place.Restaurant was crowded and noisy, kind of messy but since food is exquisite that would make me return to Allegro.	1
Came to Ball and Chain for a networking event and was a bit disappointed at myself for not knowing this place existed, especially since it has a good happy hour of 50 percent off drinks (craft cocktails included). Great venue for live music. DJ during happy hour and then live band after around eight. There&#39;s also an outdoor area in the back with a bar, cozy lounge chairs and a stage. I can only imagine how awesome and lively this place must be on a Friday or Saturday night. <br><br>On to the food. Tapas style. The Cuban spring roll was my favorite. Picture a media noche sandwich converted into a spring roll and served with a side of guava dipping sauce. Yes, this is heaven on earth for any Cuban girl...or maybe just for me. Luckily for me, my friend hates pickles so I had to finish the entire serving. The queso frito is good, so are the chicharrones. The quesadilla de chorizo was amazing. Cheesy with the perfect amount of chorizo and a large enough portion to share with a friend or two. <br><br>I really like the fact that this place is located in calle ocho, an area where I have yet to fully explore, even though I&#39;ve lived in Miami my entire life.	1
For best deal, I guess you&#39;ll want to go with the half chicken for dine in...where as we went with a quarter to that we could see how the sandwich came. You can still get your biscuit as your side with the half chicken though. Though there are only a few communal-ish tables folks were generally good about moving along and freeing up seats just your food was ready. I&#39;d recommend the cucumber slaw as a contrast to the chicken. Brewed sweet (or Yankee) tea is available along with lemonade...or go with Carolina Cheerwine red soda.<br><br>I am giving them the benefit of the doubt with 5 stars since we didn&#39;t get a breast piece with or mixed quarter, but I&#39;ll have to assume they know exactly how cook it so that it isn&#39;t dry. Is it the best fried chicken I ever had? Probably not - but I think the comparison I have to make is between this and other sit down experiences in this price range. <br><br>Oh I guess you probably won&#39;t miss it (with the redeemed ones pinned on the wall), but they have a punch card with punches for each meal your purchase. 8 punches gets you a free meal.<br><br>Do note: breakfast (chicken and non-chicken) sandwiches with their biscuits are available along with pre-ordered double whole chicken orders.	1
I went here a few weeks ago with my parents and I distinctly remember thinking, this food is just ehh nothing more, nothing less and for the price, it was more towards the eh bad scale. The drinks were good and inventive.<br><br>I wouldn&#39;t go back.	0
My husband and I went here for our anniversary and we had a wonderful time.  The servers were very attentive without being overbearing and even treated us to complimentary champagne and desserts for our anniversary!	0
The company i work for took a lunch outing to the counter and we wiped out plates clean! The burgers were so yummy and all the options that were given to create your own yummy burger was so awesome. My boss and i are huge sweet potatoe frie lovers so the fact that they supply those was a bonus within itself. Great burgers fun atmosphere and decent service.	1
Amazing house margarita and the seafood enchilada was very good.	1
Went here for dinner with my foodie friend, who said it was awesome so I went in with high expectations. <br>I&#39;m not sure if I mis-ordered, but it wasn&#39;t nearly as good as I expected. My friend had the chicken, which was good. We also tried the kale salad, which was just, &#39;meh&#39;. Could&#39;ve made that myself, only better. Then, I ordered the polenta, which was a big mistake. It wasn&#39;t tasty at all (my friends all agreed), plus, it gave me food poisoning! <br>Needless to say that I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll go here again, even though I liked the ambiance and other people&#39;s reviews are quite good. I do have to say i LOVED the mint-cucumber lemonade! That was the highlight of the meal for me. <br>Oh, and when you go, they sell caramels near the bar. You must try the beer-pretzel caramel! it&#39;s amazing.<br>I&#39;m giving them 2 stars because I actually liked the service (contrary to other reviews). We had to wait an hour for a table for 4, but because of our long wait, we got free appetizers. I thought that was a very nice gesture :) . Our waitress otherwise was kind and the wait for food wasn&#39;t long. But yeah, i had to deduct some serious stars for the food poisoning...	0
so I placed an order for pick up from them and the eggs Benedict were amazing I really liked the fact that they put the sauce on the side.<br><br>my only little let down I was I paid extra for sausage and I didn&#39;t get any but I guess thats why you should check your orders before you go!<br><br>But I would definitely come here and eat the place was packed!	1
Havana social?....My boyfriend, his best friend, and I found this place through Yelp. I was extremely tired of walking into restaurants with great decor but crap food! this place is now my new favorite restaurant in the city!<br><br>Honestly, we almost left and I&#39;m so happy that we decided to stay and eat at the bar. If only I knew about this place 3 months ago....they&#39;re food is SOOOOO GOOOOOD that I was about to cry!<br><br>I did not expect for the food to be this... amazing! My mouth had a flavorful explosion that made me feel as if fairies came and dance on my tongue with magical happy dust that collided with butterfly kisses and made sweet love. I&#39;m in love with this place! I&#39;m recommending this place to everyone I know, people I will meet in the future, whatever!<br><br>I&#39;m actually going back next week with my friend to share this amazingly delicious orgasmic food! Oh happy day	1
This place is incredible and the staff is wonderful too (Big Mike will remember your name after first visit)! Great to see more places like this opening up around Bed-Stuy.	1
The vegetarian tartine with a salad was delicious. There are not many tables, but I sat at the communal table and it was enjoyable. Here's a tip: get something with bread, cuz the bread was off the hook.	1
I've been eating here often for 3 years. It's the best thai food on all of Seattle and them some. I highly recommend phad see lew red curry green curry the green bean appetizer. It's always delicious. Best kept secret.	1
Monday night prix fixe menu. Big fan. Make reservations if you don't want to sit at the bar.	1
On a friends choice of pizza parlors we tried this joint after a round of golf and we were hungry as hell. Big lofty dining area with a huge wood burning old school oven and maybe 15 tables. We noticed that sounds just bounce off the walls so it had a pretty loud atmosphere. The menu was very simple with 5 thin crust pizzas to choose from. All with no meat of any kind exept on Saturdays when they have a special that they sprinkle some salami bits on them. We ordered the margarita and the Sat special. The pizzas were good especially the crust that was soft on the inside like it was half baked and crispy on the outside that were slightly charred. I wish they put more if the ingreedients on the pie but I think the owner wanted it clean and not to busy with toppings. I think the $20 pie was pricey for what it was and rather go elsewhere. Word of advice: do not tell them to add or substitute anything or ask for any parm cheese, chili flakes, olive oil. I heard they will give you attitude.	0
Love the patio.	1
Really good stuff. Nice menu. Fresh items. Clean place. Not much more to say. Got the Falafel plate. Home run. Fresh and healthy.	1
Your final bill will outweigh the decent food and service at Phoenecia at Alki. While the food is fine and the service was friendly and attentive the prices didn't justify our dining experience. There are better restaurants at these prices. a0We all thought that we could have had a steak dinner at Canlis or Morton's (without alchohol) for about the same price.	0
My family celebrated our wedding anniversary at Wit and Wisdom on 2/04/05.  My husband, son, and I ate well and were treated even better.  The wine pairing was my favorite and I will be returning SOON.  Thank you to the staff for making our day memorable and splendid in every way.	0
The Samgeytang here is pretty good. Tasted clean and healthy. Maybe just a little too healthy for my likings. I still think Ssan&#39;s Samgyetang suits my tastebuds best. But, I&#39;d say this is a close second. Like some other reviewers have stated, the owner is pretty damn friendly, provided excellent service with a happy smile, almost too freakishly friendly. I&#39;d definitely come back.	1
This is definitely one of the best food trucks in Miami! The chef, Kevin, is the nicest guy. We have been regulars of his for a long time and I really feel he is a talented and creative chef. Everything he&#39;s ever made me has been delicious. I have to eat from this truck whenever I see it. My husband loves the Blue Cheese and Bacon and the Buffalo melts. I recently had a melt with goat cheese, bacon and caramelized onions (a make your own) and it was so amazing. They are never soggy, and stuffed, no skimping here! In my opinion, they are WAY better than the other grilled cheese trucks we have available.	1
Food was good as the other reviews state. However, our waitress messed up the order on multiple occasions. This included giving the wrong dishes, telling us that a dish was another thereby giving the dish to the wrong person, and giving decaf macchiato to the wrong person. The espresso was okay, nothing special, but the decaf macchiato was watered down and was bad. Altogether the service can be much much better as well as their coffee.	0
Love the service and the food is great...and I&#39;d have to say the Bubble Tea is awesomely delicious .	1
One star plus for the food - sausage po boy, mac and cheese, red beans and rice. Feh. If you&#39;re stuck in the neighborhood.<br><br>An additional star for the service.	0
Delicious Food. Love that they have Cisco Grey Lady on tap. It&#39;s always served ice cold, and well priced at only $5/glass!<br><br>Brunch service can be a little slow at times, but could just be that they&#39;re still getting their bearings. Dinner service is consistently efficient. Servers are very nice. I would recommend this place.	1
Quoted for an hour for dinner so we went to the whiskey bar for drinks. An hour and a half later, still no table. So we left. Prices seemed too steep for a beachy kind of sit down spot. The only good thing was valet didn't charge us since we didn't even get to eat.. We prob had better chance of eating at Tripel (which she owns also)	0
Im not a huge drinker, but this bar has good people, good vibes and make for a good evening. It was raining out and somehow we made oyr way all the way In the back alley of this establishment. There is a small staging area used for bands/djs but nobody was there since it as a weeknight and raining.<br><br>Food here is A-Ok and the service was good. very relaxed place to hang. Bonus if you actually like drinking. There is also a bacon martini. <br><br>Yay~! I like this place.	1
I have it on good authority that my one (admittedly trivial and stupid) objection to this place has been mitigated. So here you go: the tacos here are pretty consistently excellent and worth the money. It's also a secretly-great place to watch a football game.	1
You couldn&#39;t pay me to eat here again. We went here for a birthday party, and the staff had attitude - okay, fine, they&#39;re French, it&#39;s expected. But at the same time, they didn&#39;t tell us about excess charges, so we were a little flabbergasted at the end bill. They charged per soda, no free refills, but they don&#39;t tell you that. When you to ask, &#34;what&#39;s up with all these soda charges?&#34; The guy has his argument ready, &#34;you should have asked me if you had concerns!&#34; How was I supposed to know IF YOU DON&#39;T TELL ME about it?<br><br>His next argument was that &#34;this is a standard French practice.&#34; Well, that&#39;s weird, you pay American taxes, not French ones. When in Rome, buddy...<br><br>They charged 30 bucks to cut the cake - and didn&#39;t tell us. Not to BUY the cake, just to cut it. That would&#39;ve been nice to know ahead of time.<br><br>The worst part - they were talking crap about our table in French. Well, nous parlons francais, mes amis, so we heard every word.<br><br>When we mentioned we won&#39;t come back again, he said, &#34;really? You won&#39;t come back because of soda charges?&#34; No, we&#39;re not coming back because of your incredibly bad attitude, even for French standards.	0
Are you guys all salad people? NO WARM FOOD in this place.<br><br>And $14 for a meager sour Ceviche, when it first came I thought it was salad that comes for free! <br><br>I give it 2 stars because the stone crab was quite good and fairly priced.<br><br>The place is tiny (again just a salad/sandwich type of place), absolutely not for kids, and not for average person unless you just like cold seafood. It is located in a very busy and art deco downtown area, hang around and have fun afterwards, however you need to pay for parking. $25 per person.	0
Unfortunately terrible.<br><br>The short story: <br><br>We had an 8pm dinner reservation to celebrate a birthday and didn&#39;t get sat until 9pm. Other nonsense ensued.<br><br>The long story:<br><br>We had an 8pm reservation for two on a Wednesday night. I had requested an outside table and told them it was for a birthday. We arrived a few minutes early and the host said it might be more like 8:15 since we wanted to sit outside, and that they would text me when the table was ready. It seemed totally reasonable so we proceeded to the bar to get a drink.<br><br>We put in our order with the bartender after a couple minutes, again totally reasonable. Then everything started going downhill. He proceeded to make one of the two drinks we ordered, set it on the counter, and then took orders from two other couples and gets their drinks, then comes back and makes the second drink for us. It was annoying, but I was determined to not let it bother me. It&#39;s not the first obnoxious bartender experience I&#39;ve had, I&#39;m sure it won&#39;t be the last. Drinks in hand, we went out to the patio to listen to the band while we wait for out table.<br><br>We were out there for a while and our drinks are running dry, so I look at my phone and it&#39;s 8:30, no text message about our table. I decided to check in with the host to make sure they hadn&#39;t texted us and I just didn&#39;t get it (rooftop in LA after all). I go up to the front to ask what&#39;s going on, and the the guy looks confused. I then tell him our reservation was at 8, and after a few more puzzled moments that looked a whole lot like &#34;oops we forgot&#34;, he says &#34;oh yeah, just a minute, we&#39;ll text you&#34;.<br><br>I went back to my girlfriend and continued listening to the band. 8:45 rolls around, and still no message or table. We got the attention of the other host and asked him what was going on, and and after a couple minutes he came back and said our table is ready. As we walk up to the table, another hostess is seating another party there. He apologized and sat us at a table sandwiched between two others so tight, it might as well have been a table for 6. Obviously looking displeased at this point, he apologized again and said he was going to find us another table, and that he never intended to sit us there. A few more minutes go by and finally at 9pm they sat us at a knee high wicker table that felt like I was about to sit down for a tv dinner at the coffee table at home.<br><br>He apologized again and said he&#39;d bring us some champagne, but at this point we were an hour past our reservation, hungry and irritated, on my girlfriend&#39;s birthday. We ordered and the food was fine, but the experience getting to the table was so ridiculous that the evening was totally soured.<br><br>The final icing on the cake was that I ordered coffee with dessert, which of course never came. We had to flag someone down other than our waitress to tell them to forget it once we had finished the dessert and it was clear it wasn&#39;t coming. She then had the nerve to bring it out and tell me they were &#34;making it fresh&#34;, despite me having seen people who ordered dessert after us get their dessert and coffee. I understand mistakes happen, but I don&#39;t like being told stories. Apparently they also have a coffee machine that makes &#34;fresh&#34; lukewarm coffee, and it wasn&#39;t that it was actually sitting at the wait station for 15 minutes.<br><br>I would never recommend this place to anyone. I had made it very clear that we were there to celebrate a birthday, and all the had to do was provide adequate service. Instead we got this debacle and the night was ruined. If this was the experience on a Wednesday night, I can only imagine what a disaster they are on the weekend.	0
Eek.Tried and failed. One wing and one slurp of the kalgooksoo and I was done. The fry basket was sad -- how do you make that even taste like poop. For drunken fun times this will do. But spent $70 for three entree items. Wow... Shoulda gotten a crappy kbbq instead	0
Came here for lunch today because we got into Little Tokyo just 20 minutes past when Sushi-Gen closes between Lunch and Dinner hours. I had seen this place a few times and read decent reviews from Yelp friends, so I decided to give it a try. It was 99 degrees in DTLA today and a nice cold sushi lunch was the craving. The result: very mediocre sushi at normal market prices-- freshness was questionable for the albacore nigiri and the tuna and yellowtail would have been much better had they not been heavy-handed on the wasabi between the fish and the rice, causing the nigiri to be virtually devoid of that beautiful fresh sushi flavor we all know and love. The edamame cost $4.50 and was very mushy...overall, 10 pieces of sushi and edamame came out to be $25. <br><br>We should have just sucked it up and driven to sugarfish on 7th Street, but we were stubborn and found a metered spot in Lil&#39; Tokyo.	0
Bring me Jack Sprats back!!<br><br>That place sucks and it&#39;s just another pretentious, overpriced, restaurant. <br><br>If you&#39;re looking for something innovative, and with great atmosphere, I suggest Westside Tavern. <br><br> I will NEVER eat at The Six again and will recommend to anyone who asks that this place should be avoided.	0
Fast food at it's best go here instead of Mickey dees!	1
It was an amazing night! I was really thrilled with their service, no matter where you came from or what you ordered they were very pleasing. Food was great, so was the band outside!! Loved the place, would definitely recommend it!!	1
The. Hostess was awsum. Our waitress was. Awsum. This place rocked.	1
Love Banzo's falafal pita. A very filling pita with just the right amount of ingredients. And their lunch special is a great value.	0
Let me start by saying I REALLY wanted to love Commissary. I had been looking forward to eating there for months and, being a big fan of the Roy Choi phenomenon, I had no doubt I would love it. Boy, was I wrong. The atmosphere gets 5 stars. The inside of the greenhouse is an absolutely beautiful and unique space. Communal tables, great natural light, fun mismatched table settings- Commissary successfully brings nature into the urban chaos of K-Town. It's no wonder why everyone is always posting photos of this place. Sadly, that's where my praises end. The food gets 2-3 stars. We were there for brunch so I think the menu is more basic than it is for their other meals. I ordered the Congee which was described as having a "soft egg" and two other toppings. When it arrived I was surprised to see the top of the bowl FILLED with peanuts- not listed in the description. I have a tree nut allergy (not peanuts) but was very surprised that they would not list such a sensitive ingredient in their food. My "soft egg" was raw. Maybe I am not familiar enough with culinary terms, but a raw egg is a raw egg and to me "soft egg" implies that it was at least somewhat cooked. Perhaps my egg was supposed to cook slightly in the heat of the congee, but it wasn't nearly hot enough for that- just lukewarm. I waited a few minutes to ask my server about it, but he never came back so I just ate it to avoid my meal getting cold. That brings me to my last point: the service. Or, in this case, lack thereof. Not only did our server not check on us after delivering our meals, he was IMPOSSIBLE to track down. I won't call him out by name here, but I have it written down. We politely tried to catch the attention of several staff members, only to be ignored one after another. I've worked in food service for several years (my parents were restaurant owners), so I am usually VERY patient, but this was beyond bad, especially since the place was pretty empty. When my friend finally got up to ask if someone would come help us, she was met with confused faces- like it was the most ridiculous request that we needed condiments or refills. A few minutes later (not immediately), someone (not our sever) came to help. Our coffees were empty. My friend's food, which needed salt & pepper, had gotten cold. Our waters were never refilled. When the check came and we put down 3 credit cards, our server did not ask how we wanted it split, he just grabbed our payment and disappeared. There was never an apology for the lack of attentiveness. I get it. Commissary is a "hot spot" right now. Still, that is no reason to make your patrons feel like you are doing them a favor in allowing them to eat in your restaurant. Pretentious hipster attitudes are not the reason I go out to eat- great ambiance, food, and service are. These guys should take a hint from their friends over at A-Frame on how to get it done because Commissary's staff clearly has no idea how deliver a proper dining experience. Sorry Roy, this one is far from your best.	0
I came here with my family for mothers day. We got the garlic fried chicken as appetizers, and it was tasty! The crunch on the chicken is unbelievable! I ordered the dry squid chow fun and it was pretty good. I also tried the dry pig intestine chow mein along with the dry tofu chow mein and that was delicious. I love their pickled jalapenos that they leave as a condiment on the table. Its a little spicy and sweet.	0
Canter's tastes pretty good at 3 AM when you've just started sobering up after a night of barhopping. Any other time however, I'm not so sure. Its authentic deli feel and '60s decor are inviting, but things start to fall apart once you sit down. The booths occasionally have ripped vinyl seats, sometimes repaired with duct tape, while the non-booth tables have really uncomfortable, old chairs. Unless you're willing to drop $11-14 on one of their deli sandwiches, everything else on the menu (which is a mess, btw) is your typical diner fare. You'd be just as happy eating at a Denny's.The last time I was here, I didn't want to spend more than $10 on a late-night meal, but still wanted something that would give me that authentic deli taste. So I ordered the Matzo ball soup. It was essentially just a ball of packed bread crumbs in a bowl of some kind of broth. The soup itself had no taste--it might as well have been salt water. The matzo ball tasted just how it looked, stale and dry. Even after it had soaked up most of the broth it still managed to taste dry. I'm really not sure why we eat here.	0
Let me preface this review by saying that I&#39;ve been utilizing yelp for years, but have yet to be compelled to write a review until now. The service here was so horrible that I needed to write a review about this place. <br><br>I am usually the kind of diner that is more forgiving of a lack in service if the food is exceptional. However, the horrible service at Baco Mercat by and far ruins any good dining experience that you might have here. This restaurant was recommended to us to celebrate my boyfriend&#39;s birthday brunch with his family. We called ahead, made a reservation, checked out the food online and all seemed well. I brought a cake from Susie Cakes in Manhattan Beach and wanted to bring it in, so before leaving that morning I made sure to call and see if outside desserts were allowed and what the cake cutting fee would be. Baco Mercat&#39;s phone line is tied to their other two restaurants and I had to call several times before getting someone who could answer my question. When I finally got someone on the line and asked if there was a fee, the employee said: &#34;Yes, there is, but I&#39;m not sure the exact price. I believe it&#39;s standard.&#34; In my experience a standard cake cutting fee is around $1-1.50. <br><br>We arrive at the restaurant for our 1:30pm reservation and have to wait for our entire party to arrive prior to being seated. We&#39;re seated by about 1:45pm. Keep in mind the place closes at 3:00pm and opens again in the evening. We sit down and begin chatting amongst ourselves and aren&#39;t given much attention after being seated. The restaurant wasn&#39;t packed by any means so I chalk this up to the fact that we&#39;re being so chatty (maybe we hadn&#39;t had enough time with the menu, etc). About 10-15 minutes pass and finally the waiter (mid-20s, curly dirty blonde hair, hipster glasses &amp; mustache) comes by for our drinks. We order drinks and ask about the menu for some tips on their starters. My boyfriend&#39;s mom asks the waiter what is good for sharing and what he recommends and he answers in a very condescending tone - which was very uncalled for as this is a typical thing amongst many diners who are unfamiliar with a new menu. Whatever. We go ahead and order a few starters and get back to chatting. Another 15 minutes pass and our drinks come. 5 minutes after that a few of our starters arrive. We sit with our starters and drinks for another 20 minutes all the while the waiter hasn&#39;t checked back in to ask how everything is, or take our order. The waiter finally comes back and takes our order and still seems to have an attitude and is again, outright rude. This starts to annoy me, but I keep it to myself as we were there to celebrate my boyfriend&#39;s birthday and enjoy time with his family. We wait another 20 or so minutes and our food begins to arrive, but all at separate times, which is annoying when you&#39;re in a group and have already been waiting due to lack of service. When the last dish arrives we all begin to eat and the opinion of the food is mixed among our group. Some things were good and some just okay. Their signature Baco, The Toron, was really greasy and lacking in flavor. <br><br>Skip through the rest of our meal and us asking for the cake to be brought out and this is where I truly became angry with this place. We asked for the cake and it took over 15 minutes for it to be brought out. We didn&#39;t have any candles so we just asked for the cake to be cut which altogether should take 5 minutes. After waiting for so long, we ask the waiter again, and after another 5-10 minutes a different woman who had not been serving our table brings out the cake. At this point we&#39;re one of three parties left in the place. We enjoy the cake and chat a little more over the next 10 minutes. Once we appear to be done with the cake, we sit around waiting for the waiter to stop by and bring the check. We wait another 10 minutes and he still doesn&#39;t come. My boyfriend&#39;s dad had to ask for it as he passes by our table, and again doesn&#39;t even bother to check on us. He brings the check and doesn&#39;t even bother to say thank you or ask about the food. My boyfriend&#39;s dad quickly looks over the bill and sees that there was a $4 per slice cake cutting fee. This amounts to $28 for our group of 7. That&#39;s ridiculous! It almost cost as much as the cake itself. After paying the bill we had to ask for the leftover cake because the waiter didn&#39;t even bother to bring it back out. After paying $28 for the cutting, you better believe we wanted our cake back. <br><br>The altogether experience here was far from enjoyable and the high cake cutting fee just really was the last straw. I will never dine at this establishment again. The pretentious and inhospitable environment is definitely not worth enduring for the mediocre food that they serve.	0
If you are an LA girl, you will love this place. The waiters are really really cute and super friendly. The foods good too and they definitely know they are in la :) The feta grilled cheese was amazing and the coffee is strong	1
I&#39;m giving a star because I have to. What kind of Mexican restaurant doesn&#39;t serve margaritas?!?! And the service was terrible, so terrible I got up and left.	0
Excellent food! The carrot and Kale salad is delicious. So was the gyros. My wife got the falafel which was also great. Plus $15 unlimited mimosas!	1
Love everything about it!! Wood fired pizza with amazing toppings.	0
Ordered delivery. They got my order wrong and the food I did get made me sick. Will never eat from here again. Place has been around many years, so my experience was curious. Many many many better Mediterranean options in Miami.	0
Where can a guy get some juicy chicken?<br><br>While not the cheapest rotisserie chicken, I&#39;m a fan. I grew up on Wegmans rotisserie chicken, which was only $5 a pop. Chicken Provence&#39;s $8 for a half chicken makes it more on the gourmet level, but I can definitely tell a difference in quality.<br><br>Two things stand out the most. First, Chicken Provence is more juicy. None of the meat was dry and I actually found myself cleaning the bone off more so than other varieties I&#39;ve had. Second, Chicken Provence is heavily seasoned. I actually liked that, although a few coworkers thought it was too much. It really depends on what you&#39;re looking for or what you&#39;re used to.<br><br>I want to come by again to try their sides, although it would be more of a treat versus a frequent go-to lunch spot. Stop in and test them out yourself!	1
everyone&#39;s been raving about perch so i finally took a trip out. getting a table here was a pain. if you don&#39;t have reservations, you can snag one of the first come, first serve tables. first come, first serve tables are a bad idea sometimes. i was lucky enough to grab a huge sofa area when i arrived since i had a large party coming. the bad thing about reserving it by myself was that the server had told another couple one of the sofas were open so they came and sat down. i told them i was saving it and they said the server told them to sit there. the server came over and said she could add more chairs when my entire party came. pain in the butt seating part one. later when my entire party did arrive, the space was too small so the server told us to wait for a table which we then migrated to. another woman, a snotty woman might i add, sat down with her two guy friends at the end of the table and gave me attitude when i told her the table was for us. the server had to get involved again and they were moved, naturally. pain in the butt seating part two. after getting worked up and wanting to punch the snotty woman, we were finally seated. the situation was pretty shitty but the server was really nice and you could tell she was really trying to make things work. +1 star for the server.<br><br>we ordered lamb sliders, mussels, salmon tartar and heirloom tomato salad with chicken. all were very meh. the sliders were very gamey. the salmon tartar was bland and fishy. the &#34;heirloom&#34; tomato salad wasn&#39;t really heirloom tomatoes but cherry tomatoes instead. the chicken on the salad was dry and bland. the only good thing was the mussels. <br><br>the other redeeming thing about this place was the white chocolate bread pudding. if you&#39;re gonna come here, make SURE you order this. it was AMAZING!! we also got the chocolate pot de creme which was whatevs. +1 star for the bread pudding.<br><br>i didn&#39;t try any of their specialty cocktails but i really don&#39;t think they could&#39;ve wowed me to like this place more. i really don&#39;t see what the hype is about and to be quite honest, the view is whatevs too.	0
Wanted to be stoked on this place as its closer than Matchless and Enids. The music was way too hipster dancey and the vibe was too cool-ish. We wanted to grab some quick wings and they were way too hot and the lime had no taste.. Also the tater tots were beyond over cooked. Didnt have a great first impression of this joint.	0
Nice restaurant. Has a a nice Japanese feel to it because of the small space and mainly because if the wooden structures inside the restaurant. There is a bar for those who just want sushi and the chefs sounded very polite.I ordered a spicy tuna roll and an oyako bowl. The spicy tuna roll was simply AMAZING. The tuna was so fresh and the spicy sauce was not to spicy bit spicy enough. The oyako bowl came with a salad and miso soup. The bowl was a bit small for me, but I have a big appetite, so it'll do for others. The chicken was nice and soft but the egg was perfect becaue there was a perfect amount of yolk oozing over the chicken and rice.Overall oomasa was a great experience.Next time I'll try to order a lot more sushi.	1
I ordered Mexican Viva roll and spring roll online.. I received the food exactly 15 minutes later..<br>I knew that was not a good sign..<br>The sushi was soggy and seemed to be old..<br>Vegetable spring roll tasted good..	0
I really wanted to like this place but somehow it managed to fail my expectation.<br>Ordered short ribs for an appetizer, grilled chicken with rice and jerk chicken curry bowl. Ribs were pretty good (but I cooked them at home so many times and I know it is pretty difficult to mess it up unless you&#39;re a really lousy cook). But entrees have really failed (especially for the price) and took good 40 minutes to be delivered (server&#39;s explanation was that printer in a kitchen was unplugged! Really, no tickets coming out in a kitchen on Friday night?!)<br><br>Jerk chicken curry bowl: looked like a haphazardly thrown together bunch of vegetables with chunks of absolutely unseasoned chicken breast mixed with canned curry sauce. I won&#39;t comment on couscous because it is just... couscous. C&#39;mon DW... you can do better than that for $16. Although, I admit that it tasted better next day after soaking the curry sauce :)<br><br>Grilled Jerk Chicken breast.... again barely any flavor to it and barely a trace of advertised tropical orange glaze.<br><br>We were issued a complimentary cake at the end of the meal... which at least shows that DW acknowledged the long wait and was apologetic about it.<br><br>Food aside there are some other issues that DW Bistro management can address if they want to create a proper atmosphere. Since we had good 40 minutes to wait we had nothing to do but observe people around us... in particular, waiters slapping each other butts casually on a dining floor or bus person wiping his nose with his arm (he is either sick or he was doing coke in a back of the house).	0
Canes customer service is outstanding! All their employees are super friendly and outgoing! Even though they are always busy they keep their customer service #1 and food is always fresh! I live in CA and I def always try to stop by when I can because its delish!!! Their raising canes sauce is so good! I always order extra!!! Stopping at Canes is a must!!!	1
The place looks nice and they definitely have good food. But, I happened to be 2 cents short for a side of ranch. Unfortunately, they were unable to accommodate me... Left a sour taste in my mouth. I understand company policy but I would think they would let such a small amount slide to make a customer happy.	0
I came here because I saw it on the Vegas Seven magazine and wow!, In my opinion this place sucks!. When I took my first bite of the carne asada arepa, I almost threw up! The meat is horrible, tasted old and stale. I also ordered a cachapas de queso and that was ok. The fried plantains, though on the menu it says the cost is $2.00 it really cost&#39;s $2.49 and they were not ripe either, tasted more like tostones. About the only eatable and decent thing here for me was the yuca.<br><br>In the end, we ALL have different opinions and palettes, so I suggest you still come and taste it for yourself. I, however will NEVER be coming back....	0
We went to Playa Provisions on the 4th of July and while I really like the atmosphere and overall vibe, the menu............ Not so much. The menu is very limited - we just had a whole chicken which looked and tasted awful, the sourdough bread with salted butter (tasty), and my BF had a strawberry doughnut dessert which he really liked. I feel like this place has potential, but needs to improve the menu.We also had a couple of drinks here, which were good.*It would be nice to see some more new restaurants and bars in Playa soon...	1
WARNING: DO NOT COME HERE!I am going to start this by saying if I could give "0" stars I would... I have never been so appauled by an establishment in my entire life... Why you may ask?? Here's the scoop. I went to Perch for the first time to celebrate my friends birthday. It was a Thursday night. I rolled up around 10 or 10:30, pretty excited to know there is another rooftop joint DT.Everything was going great, the view was amazing, the beer list is decent, the service was ok (nothing to complain about.) We were having a great time and then all of the sudden the tables turned. Me and a few others had seperated from the group to catch a different view and smoke a cigarette. At that time, the bouncer came over and announced "Last Call." It was like 11:35. We all had full drinks and were debating on getting one more to close the night out. Before we could even finish our smoke, the bouncers came back to announce "Ok folks, you gotta go." We were definitely a little taken aback, they literally just gave last call 2 minutes ago. We got up and walked back to our group, followed by the bouncers. Once we get to our friends, he tells us again to hurry and finish up and go. I tried to talk to the bouncer, he wasn't having it. It got to the point where I asked to speak to a manager, he told me "No." I asked he bouncer "And your name is, sir?" "None of your Fucking business."WHHHHAAAAATTTTTT????? I had only had 2 beers at this point and luckily was able to keep my composure. I went to the bartender (still being followed by this ogre bouncer,) and asked for the manager. While I did this my girl (the birthday girl) went to talk to the owner about what was going on. Finally the manager came over, I explained what happened and the behavior of the "security." The manager offered no condolences and was basically like "what do you want me to do?" I told him that I didn't know what he should do, but that I was going to write a review about my experience here. The managers response: "You think I am afraid of a Yelp review?" Now, at this point I am done with the ogre who just cursed at me and I am done with the management, my girl is still talking to the owner and we are all waiting for her (STILL being harrassed by the security guards who are STILL rudely barking at us to get out.)Finally, I was done waiting, and I just wanted to get out of their before I lost it. My friend finally left the owner (who did nothing about the situation, NOTHING,. maybe because she was drunk... maybe she just doesn't care about her business and her customers)The owner of this place used to own The Must. Any DTLAer probably knows what a great place that was. Sorely missed when they closed (now I'm starting to wonder if The Stray Cat isn't so bad afterall...)Anyway, if you are looking for a rooftop spot DTLA stick with The Standard or Elevate or find a friend with a sweet rooftop at their apartment..... whatever you do, DO NOT GO TO PERCH!!!!!	0
Reviewing business as: Deli/Restaurant/Convenience Store for Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner.<br>Pros: Peter, the proprietor; Peter&#39;s father, Jae; singularly wonderful customer service; good-quality food; good quantity of food; good food prices; television; lots of seating (especially considering that this establishment is located in downtown Los Angeles).<br>Cons: none.<br>Review:<br>1. Customer service: *****: While there must be twenty places to eat encircling the trio of skyscrapers underneath which the Deli-In sits, I eat here whenever I&#39;m in the area. When I first started working in the area, I tried eating at many nearby establishments, but I usually encountered overpriced, small portions of bad food accompanied by painfully-slow, apathetic customer service. And then I found the Deli-In! Peter, the proprietor, is exceptionally friendly and accommodating. In fact, one reason I am reviewing the Deli-In as a restaurant, in addition to as a deli, is because Peter will bring your food out to you. That&#39;s just one example.<br>2. Amenities:*****: There is an area in the back of the store with tables and a television. Peter usually has either a movie playing or cable television. If you want something else on, just ask. If there&#39;s a big game on, then chances are that it will be on (because someone asked Peter to put it on). The Deli-In also has an ATM, and sells lottery tickets, cigarettes, and Fiji water.<br>3. Food:*****: Peter has a wide variety of food that will be cooked fresh upon ordering. The menu is on the wall behind and over the counter. His hamburgers, omelets, and sandwiches are all excellent. Obviously, if you order off this menu, there is a small wait while the food is prepared (or you can call ahead). For the lunch crowd, the Deli-In offers a rotating selection of food on a line. Personally, I love the ribs, ground beef mixes, taquitos, and pupusas. My list is longer, but that&#39;s all I can remember for the moment. Either way, make sure to ask for a side of pico de gallo (excellent) and pickled cabbage salad (also excellent, but I am guessing on the name). <br>Reviewing as: Regular customer.<br>Overall: *****: The best place around.	1
Great place. Downfall is it is always packed, so at times the wait takes forever. Great place for a casual brunch or lunch. They have an expansive menu which is great for all picky eaters and kids alike. I love the Tuscan Salad, the open face, the eggwich, the french fries, the shakshuka and the soft tacos! But everything is pretty good! <br><br>Service is so-so, sometimes great sometimes lacking.<br><br>Check out pics of Toast on Instagram - @thefoodie411	1
A friend suggested I check this Midtown place out for lunch. He told me about the steamed buns and Asian fusion food. I was really looking forward to it. My actual experience, however, didn&#39;t live up to what he had said.<br><br>I went in to pick up a lunch to-go. I looked over the menu and I was surprised by how few vegetarian options there were. I had anticipated being able to order a steamed vegetable bun, but they didn&#39;t have any on the menu. I asked at the counter and they said that they didn&#39;t make any veggie buns. Too bad. So, I ended up ordering the vegetable of the day, marinated eggplant, with a side of brown rice.<br><br>The eggplant had a good flavor and the brown rice was, well, brown rice. My food was fine, but I couldn&#39;t see myself going back just to get those two items again.<br><br>I&#39;d be happy to see them expand their vegetarian selections and would be thrilled if they started to make steamed veggie buns and perhaps bi bim bop.	0
Went to this place last night with a group of friends. We waited in line outside for approximately 30 minutes before being let in, and led up two elevators to the 16th floor. Once at the top you get a very nice view of Downtown LA, and the ambiance of this place is pretty nice. The price of alcohol is, as expected, not too cheap due to the location... but they have a pretty good selection of beverages to suit all your needs. It was pretty crowded and there weren't that many places to sit so get here early if you want to sit somewhere with a decent view. We ended up getting a table on the patio towards the end of the night which was a relief. Overall the experience was a good one. I just think they should have a larger selection of seats that aren't reserved to accommodate more of their guests.	1
Best in the NW bar none.	1
You find the best Nicaraguan carne asada at this place! the carne asada is soft a condimentson it is to the point. Love their cacao drink as well. The prices are low and portions generous. Great place for takeout.	1
Let me caveat this with the fact that I wasn&#39;t drunk when eating here, so I wasn&#39;t as starving as I might have been with a few drinks in my stomach. <br><br>That said, this is some DAMN good hole in the wall food. Stick with the sam ghae tang or the jook. My friend had the kimcee chigae and was a little disappointed---mostly because they use a pork broth which is sweeter than the anchovie broth her mom uses. <br><br>My sam ghae tang was good though I would have liked the ginger to be in the broth more as opposed to buried deep in the rice. <br><br>The jangjorim is AMAZING!! I would just eat that for my dinner if it was socially acceptable. <br><br>As the other reviewers note, the place is TINY so go early or be prepared to wait. But this place does a good job satisfying your fix for simple, mom-style korean comfort food.	1
Cute spot and close to home. This joint is like that ex-boyfriend who lives nearby so you keep going back. But every time you do you&#39;re reminded why he&#39;s your ex in the first place. Over-priced, perfectly adequate food paired with terrible terrible service. For a spot that&#39;s just not that busy, it doesn&#39;t make sense why it takes soooo long to get waitstaff to greet you and take your order. Drinks are rarely if ever refilled and the only way to get anyone to bring your bill is to go to the counter and throw down your credit card. The only reason I&#39;m even writing this is because I mistakenly stopped by for a latte and bagel to go. Almost 20 minutes later, my bagel has finally arrived. Nuff said.	0
I have searched far and wide for a comparable frita. Haven&#39;t found one yet! These are the best fritas in town. Sorry, El Rey de las Fritas, Morro Castle has you beat! Also, the prices can&#39;t be beat. You can eat a meal for two with just $10.	1
The delicately sweet pastries I sampled last week were better than the items I buy from Bakery Nouveau in West Seattle because they are less sweet and the flavor of the butter is more intense.	1
This is the worst customer service ever! Been here for 40 minutes on a Monday night... And these idiots decided to sit a party of 2 in a big booth instead of sitting a party of 6 in it... I'm pissed!!!	0
I can&#39;t comment much as we we&#39;re only here for a few minutes but what I will say is that the bouncers here are extremely rude and unprofessional. They took away my friend&#39;s ID as the bouncer claimed that it was a fake when it reality it was not. Now she has to pay to get a another one. Beware of this place and be prepared to pay more then just a cover to try to get in.	0
Well... I just got back from eating at Umami Burger with a friend and after spending $30 bucks for 2 burgers, one order of fries, a beer and an iced tea, I'm still hungry and about to make my self a grilled cheese. The burgers are small and what I mean by that I mean 4 to 5 bites. The small handed guy in the Burger King commercials would have no trouble one fisting one of these nouvelle sliders and at $8 to $15 bucks a pop thats one non value meal. Now don't get me wrong, beyond the lame atmosphere and high prices, what I had was very good. I'm a vegetarian so my choices in this area are rather limited but they do offer a vegetarian version of the Umami Burger. This entails a nice bun filled with a marinated portobello that's been pressed and grilled so a crisp layer of char coats each side. The mushroom patty is then topped with a grilled cheese wafer ( This is a circle of cheddar cheese that has been grilled so as to be crispy). Then topped off with 4 small pieces of marinated shitaki mushrooms and a 3/4" in diameter slice of tomato. They were out of there home made pickles or I would have had one of those as well. Let get to the fries... what can I say they were fries. Fresh cut potatoes fried to a golden brown and served with a Chinese spoon full of tomato ketchup. Johnny Rockets does them just as well at one third the cost.So, If you want to experience Umami Burger please do. But if your the type of person who likes to get a meal for there hard earned money than you might want to go to the corner burger joint and save this place for the hipsters to wallow in.	0
Came here one night with Jaron right before they closed. Thought they would hate me because most cafes do when I make them make me fresh coffee a few minutes to closing. But the barista still made it. And he gave full explanations for all of the cool looking desserts. And then I saw a piano upstairs, so I forced Jaron to go play it. I joined him and sang a few songs. The staff like the way the music bounced off of the open-spaced industrial loft and said we were welcome to come by and make music any time.We'll try to make it a habit. But while I'm stuck in a stale corporate building, I follow their blog & twitter and pretend I'm a freelancer listening to the music and seeing the scenes that they post.-Jen	1
Fish and chips is light and not oily. The burger is the best you will get in the area.	1
Don't eat here.  Plain and Blah.  I've been in the hospitality industry.  The food here is for sure not made fresh.	0
Churchill is perfect! Great service. The vibe is artsy and and full of the Hollywood/Beverly hills scene. Their Cocktails are great. I love the bull dog and the Hyde park fizz personally. Although they have some great craft brews on tap as well. For brunch I loved the short rib hash. Full of flavor but not too heavy. For a dinner appitizer I recommend the duck sausage pizza . It&#39;s a perfect blend of sweet and savory. And the flat iron steak entree melts in your mouth. I love this place!	1
The Churchill is a great place to enjoy a well made cocktail. I suggest making reservations for patio seating, even on a chilly night (they have heaters). It usually has a lively crowd, but not too packed that you have to wait 20 minutes to get a drink at the bar. The food is great too. It is a little pricy, but there&#39;s always happy hour!	1
Cili is always a great experience. We had numerous business meals and one big catered business event there - the service and food quality have never let us down. It is a beautiful place for special occasion meals as well.	1
Very good. Only complaint is the crispy shrimp & sweet potatoes could have been beter with more shrimp	1
Went in for a casserole, but alas you must call ahead because these are actually cooked to order (45 minutes).<br><br>However, the tuna salad with side salad was excellent! Also, had the tomato soup which was equally satisfying. Even the lemonade was different with the touch of lavender.<br><br>Garden out back was very pleasant as was the interior. Everyone there was extremely friendly and looking to make our experience as perfect as possible.<br><br>Will be back and will phone ahead for a casserole.	1
One of my favorite places to eat when I can't make up my mind, especially after a long night of partying. Breakfast is delicious!!! Breakfast burrito with avocados on top and iced coffee will start your day off right. Dessert you have to get the snow capped brownie! It's a must.	1
Ohhhhhh, wasabi fries. Where have you been ALL OF MY LIFE?Also, bartender, I know my cohorts gave you hard time about the execution of your vodka martini but my gin & tonic was fan-%%ingtabulous. Congrats. You pleased the pickiest of people I know (not me, my "cohorts").I wish I could have had a few more apps here because I feel I would have been impressed.What an introduction to Little Tokyo! As a 6-year resident of LA proper, I never thought to explore this area (when you live and work mostly on the westside, the westside where you stay...). But now, this is where i shall take my friends for Sunday Funday.Will definitely be back, especially if the Red Sox meet the next round!!	1
Overall not a bad place to get Italian food generally I wind up ordering the meatballs haven't had a bad experience and it has a great environment for afternoon business lunch.	1
This place has a great atmosphere and the food is really good but the portions are too small. We ended up spending $90 for two drinks, one very small appetizer, and a medium sized plate of risotto. Our waiter, Chris, was very helpful and unusually attentive for a Miami server. He told us that all of the food is organic and much is brought directly from Italy but I still think they could enlarge the portions just a little considering the price.	1
This is the worst dining experience that we have had in a while. When you go to a place priced like Bouley, you expect the best. This is clearly not what we got, not even close. <br>The service was very poor and the maitre d was very simply rude and arrogant. We had a horrible table that was in the way of all waiters. Food was ok bt nothing spectacular really. <br>Don&#39;t go there.	0
Had a great first time here. We had shrimp and crab in their medley mix with rice and Cajun fries. The seasoning was so garlicky and flavorful and good to the last bite! Don't forget to check in and get your free drink. My new favorite place!!	1
The Saint Austere, while tasty and chic, is incredibly overpriced for such a minuscule amount of food. The whole &#34;family style&#34; they tote openly about their restaurant is utterly ridiculous. Also, if you make reservations for a group, make absolute certain that these folks are coming because you will be charged $15 for every person that does not show up.	0
These guys are straight up CROOKS! They are rude, crooked, and shouldn't even be in business.	0
I've eaten here twice and the food was good. Nothing special, but still pretty decent. I had pizza and a salad each time. The pizza was good, but the salad was a little too plain for my taste. It's a nice place, but the food doesn't really stand out.	0
Always Great!!! <br>Amazing food and amazing people! <br><br>Check out the bacon cheese burger!	1
I've only been here for the bakery. Today,we loaded up. My mom ordered four chocolate chip danishes. My auntie ordered an almond biscotti-like pastry. I ordered plain and chocolate-topped cheesecake. It had been a few years since we had come here. It pleases me very much that the quality hasn't decimated.	1
My kind of place. Historical, oozing with personality and charm. Awesome sandwiches piled high with meats. The sides are delicious and the pickles are something for your tastebuds to behold. The counters with cookies. Which by the way are delicious and age defying recipes, are not to be missed. Specifically, the black and white cookie has the reputation.	1
I've been to the Nitty Gritty about four or five times before hockey games and always enjoyed it. The bar was full, a bit tough to get a bar but expected, and it seemed like a great time. We recently went there to watch the NCAA Football National Championship. I thought it'd be a nice place for a group of about 8 of us to watch it. The game wasn't on when we got there, and we mentioned we wanted to watch it and they sat us where we could see the game and then put the game on. There were a few tables of people in the bar with people, and all of us were interested in the game. However, they would not turn the sound on. We asked the waitress, and she spoke to the manage, and the returned to tell us sorry but she couldn't. We didn't really understand why, as everyone wanted to watch it, so we asked to talk to the manager. He came over and said his boss wouldn't let him do it, but he'd be happy to send this person over. Ok, we'll keep doing this, we thought. Yes, please send him over. Well that person never arrived. We waited and waited for about 20-30 min for the person to give us a reason why they wouldn't turn the sound on for a game that everyone was watching. We got fed up and walked over to the Steak and Lube that had the game on with sound and a lot of people watching it. I do not think I'll be heading back to the Nitty Gritty (unless it's before a hockey game) anytime soon.	0
What a special treat!  Delcious!!!  Love that cheese flatbreads!  Service is excellent and best hour of our day!	0
Found a new gem!I've been here a couple times now, and I'm definitely a fan! I'm not sure how "slim & healthy" this place really is, but I do feel healthier eating here than the other places in Ktown. I've tried: -Whole Pumpkin Soup (DELICIOUS. A MUST!!)-Seafood Pesto Basil Pasta (pretty good. nice kick from the garlic)-Dr. Robbin Hot Pizza (it's made with korean hot pepper paste... it's kinda weird. I DO NOT recommend it)-Arugula Pizza (tasted kinda bland)-Dr. Robbin Pizza (it's aight..)the pizzas here are made with whole wheat tortilla and the pastas are made with whole wheat pasta, so it should be relatively healthy. :)Service is fantasticcccc! Prices range from $10-15 :) Go try!!	1
Great romantic atmosphere. Great French food. Great view. I ordered the chicken dish with brussels sprouts and potatoes. The chicken was perfectly cooked, juicy and moist on the inside and the skin was a little crispy. I'm sure it was only seasoned with salt and pepper, and that's all it needed. I also tried the steak frites, which was delicious with blue cheese melted on top. As for the rooftop bar, it gets pretty crowded on a Saturday night, so plan on getting there earlier. Bon appetit!	1
Intrigued by the 4 stars and happened to stay at the Venetian so why not right?!<br><br>Well the food sounded terrific on the menu and it was good. Tried the Elvis pancakes and they were delicious. The fact we had to wait about an hour wasn&#39;t so pleasant.<br><br>The server had the worst attitude and anytime we asked for anything, we were greeted by whispers under his breath.. Luckily another server was able to help us out.<br><br>It&#39;s tough to justify the wait for the food. I wouldn&#39;t wait again for the food or being ignored by your server.	0
So disappointed.. Actually very disappointed.. We got there at 2:20pm for Sunday brunch and the first thing we are being told is.. :&#34;we are done sitting for the day.. &#34; not even a good afternoon first...<br>You don&#39;t want my business, you won&#39;t have it ever again....<br>At least they should post everywhere that Brunch is until 2:20 not 3pm.	0
I had wanted to go here for quite a while. We were seated in a quiet corner, which was nice, until a strong musky odor overcame me. It seems that the wine they had sat us near was really funky... like moldy paper (the labels I guess). I switched seats with my wife, who didn't seem bothered, and we continued our meal. The food was good but less than impressive. My entree was $27 and composed of a bed of saurkraut, 2/3rd's of a sausage, and a *tiny* bit of pork belly. All in all, I felt regretful that I had not gone around the corner and tried to get a seat at Bestia.	0
I had a hard time deciding on my entree. I had the papardelle with braised short ribs. My friend had the pici...Food was excellent.  It was over the Magic convention so it was busy in the restaurant but I feel like Vegas should be used to this. The service left a bit to be desired. That was the only disappointment. I was happy with the wine and loved the sommelier who came to our table and asked all the right questions to help us pick the perfect wine. Overall I enjoyed it and would go back.	1
Best meal i have had in years? Will be back again and again.	1
Great addition to our neighborhood. We only have been once, but it was a Saturday night at seven, and while it wasn&#39;t on a wait, it was busy. The place is small, but the decor and ambiance is very nice and classy, yet with plenty of TVs on ESPN! The bar area is beautiful.<br><br>Our server wasn&#39;t bubbly or ridiculously upbeat. Instead, she was very forthright and honest in answering our questions. She told us what she liked, what she didn&#39;t like, and why. She told us anything we wanted to know (the catch was Mahi, and she did admit that it was frozen and not flown fresh and that it probably wasn&#39;t as good as the price point, which was brutally honest and refreshing!) Her alternative recommendation was fantastic. Our beers were very good, and again, our server had plenty of feedback about them. Like I said, she wasn&#39;t someone we would necessarily call warm and fuzzy, but she was a fantastic server for her knowledge and attentiveness. <br><br>The hostess greeted us promptly as we walked in and wasn&#39;t stuffy or pre-scripted. Her invite to seat us (&#34;Mind if I get you a table?&#34;) set the bar high in sophistication but still made us feel relaxed and welcomed. <br><br>The place definitely has a cozy feel. I hope the next visit is as good as the first.	1
I saw an ad for this place, and it sounded pretty good. Exactly like a Qdoba, but with a bit of a fun decor. We were greeted enthusiastically when we walked in the door. That was nice. <br><br>I got the chicken in a bowl, with the brown rice...I was not feeling adventurous enough to try the seaweed rice...and the charred pineapple verde. The portions were massive. I ended up taking half of mine home with me. The flavor was pretty good, especially the guacamole and with the lime juice that I squeezed over the top of it all. I was disappointed in the pineapple verde though. There was not much flavor to it, but there were lots of other flavors competing with it. <br><br>My husband like his bowl, ended up getting all three salsas on his and said that it was tasty, but with no real spicy kick. <br><br>I think that I would try this place again, but only if I am in the area. It is too similar to Qdoba/Chipotle for me to go out of my way to come back. The food is flavorful, but it was not that hot temperature wise. I like my food to come out steaming hot, and this was luke warm.	1
The customer service is terrible here. I was a regular, but now I am a non-regular. I purchased a round of beers, and I ended up getting a nice &#34;over charge&#34; on my debit card. Tried contacting management the next day but never got a response. I tried again and the same happened...What&#39;s the point of having a business when you can&#39;t contact anyone who knows how to provide customer service to issues such as this?! Simply put, ridiculous and unprofessional, and if you do go to perch pay in CASH only and check your receipt!	0
We ordered the antipasto of the house which was huge and delicious. I was practically full by the end of the dish. The tapanada was really good.	1
Pizza was delicious, service was excellent. We really enjoyed our early dinner here (430pm). It's a short drive to Logan airport (less than 10 minutes) so we ate here before going to the airport to drop off my boyfriend. Parking was easy at this time of the day.	1
Dinner here Saturday night before a show at the Bell House. A birthday party had practically bogarted the joint, so we were lucky to get a table at all. Ate starter bruschetta and drank a cola at the bar -- which is well worth perching at if you can&#39;t get seated properly. Once we got seated, they broke our party in two and smushed us in between a long row of related revelers.<br><br>I had the $9 spaghetti and meatballs. The spaghetti sans meatballs comes in at an attractive $7, but the meatballs are well worth the $2 difference. Sausagey in flavor, they were delicious. I&#39;d get the spaghetti again in a heartbeat. Drowned it with a limonata.<br><br>Everyone else at the table seemed to enjoy their dishes, as well. The pizzas looked great and can easily feed two -- don&#39;t just get one for yourself!<br><br>Go when it&#39;s not so crowded, and when everyone else doesn&#39;t know everyone else, and it&#39;ll feel more like a restaurant usually feels. Still, an excellent place.<br><br>Update: Went last night for dinner. Hella less crowded. Weeknights might be slow. Got an outside table for the setting sun. Pleasant, but no little truck traffic from down the way. Got the pepperoni pizza, which was a little salty but otherwise OK. Other folks got the salmon, prosciutto and lettuce pizza, etc. Seemed pleased. One dish came way late because they screwed up the order, but they comped it, which was a nice gesture.	1
The atmosphere touched me in a way most restaurants have not before. I enjoy how the umbrellas signify the downfall of republicanism in the united states. I liked the option of not putting cheese on my grilled cheese, really creatively showing how "toast" can come from anything. Overall, this is an incredible experience and the best restaurant i have ever imagined. It's also a fun place to grab some coffee after listening to spoken word with my acquaintances at the local club.	1
Definitely a viet owned restaurant. But the food is bomb and fixes any other issues that you could have with the place. I have eaten there about 40-50 times and have never gotten sick or had anything wrong with my food. What me and my girlfriend always get when we go there is Pork Fried rice and the Roasted Duck noodle(dry style). When ever we go there we want to try other things but we always go back to these two items because they are so damn good. As for appetizers my favorite is the Chicken wings. I once ordered a couple trays full of them to take to a party i was going to because i wanted every one to experience how amazing they were.	0
I was hungry and looking for a place to eat at the embarcadero. I didn't want to walk to Pier 39 so I settled on Pier 23. They have tables at the back with a good view of the bay. However, food was ok but overpriced compared to other restaurants.	0
We have wanting to go to this place for a long time and finally we get a chance to try it. Unfortunately we were very disappointed. Every dish we had was average and over salted. The dishes lacked complexity and flavor except the salt was very forward on most of the dishes. I could not even eat the vegetables they were drowning in salt. The pasta was average and the pork shoulder lacked any depth of flavor. The pizza dough was very chewy and over salted..the roasted chicken was more like a boiled chicken. The one highlight was the service, it was decent.	0
This place has the best hot dogs a little pricey, but you can get anything you can imagine on your hot dog. If your in the mood for hot dogs you should def check this place out.	1
The only reason I gave it a 1 star is for the decor. The male waiter we had was so unfriendly, we were seated in the back and didn't have any light it was so dark and took a candle for the table next to us and he took it away saying " each table gets 1" and u can use your iPhone for light ! Like are u serious !?? Ordered a bottle of wine and took 15 min to get it , not to mention when we asked for a dry Chardonnay he had to ask the manager for a recommendation, the waiter is so unprofessional. The bread is horrible don't waste ur time or the calories ! Tried the truffle and plain. Ordered the chop salad, (which u can't go wrong) the sliders, (good) and basket of bones (horrible )and main course the lobster with shrimp. (Over cooked and too much butter and oil ) This place will not last long, customer service zero. And food and decor a 1.	0
I really loved their seafood noodles and this one spicy noodle dish. Their menu isn&#39;t big but they put real hard work into perfecting the ones they have. If you&#39;re a spicy dish lover, you should definitely check this place out. It&#39;s worth the buck.	1
What better way to spend a wednesday than in the company of friends with food and beverage. Sometimes the meal itself is not the centerpiece of the night as much as the company that shares in it. It is an unquantifiable and totally subjective element that can make a meal into an experience. Was the meal absolutely the best meal I have ever had? That is hard to say. Unlike other material goods, a meal leaves your mind like a faded memory. Each time you recall it you may remember things differently from before. What lasts is the impression, the colors, sounds, the traces it leaves as remnants in your mind. The way a passing woman carrying a potted plant back to her apartment, passing the window as your plate arrived, can add to the meal itself. Just as duck confit with cherries can nourish the body the way friends can nourish the soul.	1
Just opened today. Great little spot. Quaint decor and tasty food. I grabbed a shot from Sunnyside Shine cause I gobbled up my food so fast. We had the Vegetable Momos (dumplings), Vegetable Thali, and the potato chili.<br><br>The Momos were great and delicious. They came with 8 to an order and some pickled daikon. <br><br>Vegetable Thali is similar to the indian version. It came with aloo gobi (potato and califlower) dish, bok choy salad, lentil soup, papadam, 2 different types of pickle and rice. <br><br>the the potato Chili. It was thin sliced potatoes and peppers and was very tasty. Beware of the little green chilis. I popped one of those and my mouth and it was like hot fire! <br><br>Definitely going again. Great vegetarian options, the staff was nice too.	1
We took a group of international visitors to Cafe Paloma and they loved it! The salad dressings are great the hummus amazing and the service was friendly and efficient. Definitely recommended.	1
Worst restaurant I've tried in a long time. Decor is good. And the place is always crowded. But why oh why the food sucks so much ? The four of us each ordered something different : steak , duck leg ... And we all hated it. This place is truly an piece of work. Guess being in a prime location makes them lazy and ignorant	0
outstanding&quot; welcoming and comfortable. The food was amazing!!! You will not leave here unsatisfied. Service was friendly and perfectly timed. Chef and his team brought a special dessert with a candle for our son who is special needs thanking him for being there, (tears of course from mom) then even took the time to take a picture with him..WOW, THIS WAS NOT YOUR TYPICAL VEGAS EXPERIENCE, SOOOO MUCH MORE. We had the tasting menu for the price I could not believe how much food we had and the general manager paired each course with wine &quot;PERFECTLY&quot;. This place is a hidden gem, the price is right, the service amazing, ambiance was warm and comfortable  and they make you feel like family. Kudos to the team I can't wait to return just to have dinner here again. Thank you	1
Great atmosphere and awesome decor. Ordered the bacon wrapped dates, shrimp and grits, along with the tempranillo wine. All 3 were really good. Would definitely go back again	1
The food was delicious and the staff was great! The place is spectacular and the bar is out of this world.	1
OK it&#39;s taken me awhile to write this review because I love it THAT MUCH. This LA/Hollywood institution has a firm grasp on my heartstrings and I don&#39;t really ever care to get free. Here&#39;s a breakdown (best I can do) of why:<br><br>Parking:<br>-free parking (1.5 hrs) in two different lots for those dining in. If you&#39;re nice, sometimes the guy will park it for you. Tip him.<br><br>Ambiance:<br>-Americana diner/non-Kosher Jewish Deli, has hosted tons of stars over the years, from Guns &#39;n&#39; Roses to the next up and coming band, comedian, actor, etc.<br>-Open 24/7, closed only for Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur.<br>-little to no wait for seating<br>-comfortable seating from a table of one to large groups (tables, booths, bar)<br>-the Kibbitz room available for jam sessions (open mic Sunday 9-11:30PM, happy hour 4-7PM every day)<br>-busy, bustling environment that doesn&#39;t interfere with the personal experience<br><br>Staff:<br>-huge kudos for Fale, the best waitress that has ever existed. I always get treated like a dear friend and I tip her like I&#39;m a millionaire (I&#39;m not). I could go on about her for hours.<br>-all staff are to-the-point and efficient while maintaining a polite aire.<br>-seated quickly, served quickly, refills throughout your meal<br><br>Food:<br>-best dishes: blintzes with sour cream and strawberry sauce, pastrami eggs benedict on an english muffin, bacon, fresh fruit.<br>-bakery offerings you must try: bagels (duh) and chocolate chip rugelach (Fale&#39;s favorite parting gift for me).<br><br>They cater, they accommodate large groups (and lone wolfs) and will even ship rugelach to you if ordered online (<a href="/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cantersdelishop.com%2F&amp;s=9832f2d7fa39d6d7b41160725cbf5fd3bc6387fb0facd0cb79ae0137a38e94ac" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">cantersdelishop.com</a>) which I will be doing once I move to MA.<br><br>I can&#39;t for the life of me rationalize how people could have a negative experience here. I live in Arizona, travel to Hollywood every couple of months and these people remember me each time. They know where I want to sit, what I&#39;m going to order, and treat me the way everyone wants to be treated: special. Maybe it&#39;s because I pay each person the respect they deserve, give them a little smile and try to make their day a little brighter. Canter&#39;s is quite simply, the cornerstone of a happy day in Hollywood to me and my most favorite place in the world. Long live Canter&#39;s! Seriously, don&#39;t ever close. xx	1
We arrived five minutes late to see our reserved table being handed to another couple. I&#39;ll try again another time, but the disorganization amongst the wait staff was noticeable	0
A cleaner version on dgm. The food is really good and the atmosphere is good. It&#39;s reasonably priced but happy hour is most worth it. <br><br>Recommendation: try to tofu kimchi it&#39;s pretty good!	1
While only a small review I did want to give this place and the owner some praise. I live and work in the area and have been walking by this place trying to open for a few weeks. I went in one day and the owner was extremely nice. They were making some test food in the kitchen and he let me try a nice large piece of a Chicken salad sandwich. It has an excellent &#34;pesto&#34; style sauce on it which was a great alternative to a heavy mayo base, lots of fresh herbs and the chicken was juicy and delicious. but the baguette they us; this bread on was FANtastic. Soft, moist, held the food well. <br><br>Cant wait to go and try the whole menu, really looking forward to trying it all.<br><br>UPDATE: now have orders 3-4 times and gone for lunch. This is a must try for anyone in the area. The chicken sandwich with the potatoes is fantastic. The whole chicken is great and the sides are very good (Cauliflower and Spinach). The only thing I didn&#39;t love was the rice, a little bland and needed seasoning.	1
Opening day today. Full house. This place is probably going to be the third hot spot on the block. <br><br>The ramen is amazing. I had my first taste pre sake at the sake festival this summer and I couldn&#39;t wait. I had the #1 on the menu. They had a partial menu for the opening. The broth is so smooth and creamy....it&#39;s like carnitas broth..really a great way to welcome the new year. I can&#39;t wait for the full experience so I can give a full review.	1
The only thing good here is the food. If that&#39;s the sole reason you&#39;re going, then head on over. But here&#39;s what happened...<br>8pm reservation for 4...seated at 8:30<br>20 min to get water &amp; drinks<br>very limited drinks menu<br>30 min to get one appetizer<br>15 more to get the other<br>30 more for food<br>20 more after we asked for the check.<br>The guy who worked there was apologetic, but did not offer to comp anything (not even a round of drinks! an app!) for us being seated a half hour late. And when we tried to get his attention for this or that, he was sitting down at another table socializing for about a half hour. I get the feeling that only personal friends of the staff get good service here, and we will not be coming back. There are great arepas elsewhere.	0
We went to have lunch at Ken Ken Ramen on a sunny day. When we stepped it, it was so dark that I could barely see things. We sat at the seats infront of the ramen chef. The table and chair were both sticky. Luckily I bought my hand wipes with me. We've ordered the Miso ramen and was somewhat disappointed. I could only tasted salt in the broth and the egg seemed kind of too raw for me that I had to poke it and let it sit in the broth a little bit. Wish they could make the boil eggs as good as Orenchi Ramen!	0
For all the hype, the pizzas were very salty and the dough tougher than any I have had from a restaurant. But two stars for the friendly service.	0
Worse dinning in Miami!<br>I just had yesterday a surprise B-day party for my husband and the night was a totally disaster. I do not even know how to begin writing this review...the service was horrendous. <br>We had close to 30 people in the party and 10 people never got their main course because the restaurant had a problem with the system and the kitchen never received their order. Incredible....and the other tables which received their orders, the food was not so good either...All the tables were charged wrongly...the night was a total failure, and I feel bad for having invited so many people for a place that lacks of management skills, educated staff...again...I can be adding so many bad things for this review of the experience that I had yesterday. The place had a great potential because it is located in a big yard with different art sculptures, and great paints, but the service is the worse I have even seeing in Miami. I would never come back...and none of my friends would either...	0
The lunch experience was so so. Nothing impressive but nothing negative either. Food was okay. Service was okay. Reminded me of sitting in an office building.	0
The food is okay, those delicious fried mac n cheese balls are a heart attack waiting to happen, but anything fried is! I would have enjoyed myself if we didn't have a bitchy, gothic, hate-my-life waitress! She turned around to help other customers WHILE WE WERE ORDERING. Was she high?!?! I don't know. Since it's walking distance from my house I'll try it out at least one more time, I hear the Bossa Nova Waffle Sundae is bomb. But do me a favor- if you sit at her table, give her the ol' pie in the face for me. I didn't have the energy, nor did I order pie.	0
Came here for pancakes the other day. Our waiter was hilarious - he kept making little funny jokes whenever he checked up on us. My friend and I shared a plate of pancakes and asked them to put a scoop of ice cream on top - so yummy! The whole plate filled us both (and we were hungry) and the entire thing only cost about $6! Definitely would come here again. I love that they&#39;re open 24/7 too.<br><br>NOTE: Cash only! For parking, they have a validated lot across the street - it&#39;s $2 with validation.	1
The food is great! The steak is carne asada BBQ-right off the grill quality and it&#39;s delicious. The guac and salsa are fresh and yummy also. Oh, and the owners are friendly! Bienvenidos!	1
Wow! This place is the true definition of a hidden geml My boyfriend and I came in here after wanting to try this place for a long time. My boyfriend had to work late, so we came in around 11:30pm on a Saturday. We split the burger, mussels, and brussel sprouts. The burger had these amazing homemade &#34;pickles&#34; (they called them quickles) that literally made this one of the best damn burgers I have ever had. The mussels and brussel sprouts were also to die for. Oh and did I mention the service was beyond amazing? Needless to say, it was a great meal. We ended up coming back a few days later...and then a few days later...and then a few days later. I find myself constantly craving this place and wanting to go back.<br><br>We also came in for brunch a few times and I have still not been disappointed. The first time we went for brunch, my boyfriend got the breakfast sandwich and I got the crab benedict. Holy COW! I still have dreams about that meal. The second time we came for brunch, I got the french toast and fried chicken and my boyfriend got the burger. Still just as good as the first time we came in with impeccable service to boot.<br><br>Our most recent visit has been post-the-beginning-of-Lent, and for some reason, I decided to give up refined carbs this year. I wanted to eat here, and I hadn&#39;t even really realized, but a lot of their menu is very no-carb-friendly! PERFECTION! When we came in, we got the brussel sprouts, mussels and house salad. Jeez, this place can literally do no wrong.<br><br>Oh, I also forgot to mention the drinks! They have a gin &amp; tonic with home made tonic. UGH It was ridiculously refreshing and delicious. They also have a bourbon/root beer combo that will put hair on your chest but still taste damn amazing. The bloodies are pretty great too.<br><br>Another thing I love about this place is the music/atmosphere. Every time we&#39;ve been here the music has been different, but it&#39;s always been really good (like REALLLY good). They&#39;ve played some oldies, some R&amp;B, some 90s/2000s hip hop. It&#39;s a fun time. The ambiance is very laid back as well, so it&#39;s a great place to enjoy a good meal.<br><br>I think I could go on and on about this place up to the character max, but I&#39;ll just leave you with this one thought: Basically, I absolutely love this place and I am slightly obsessed. You need to try it.<br><br>Omg last thing...MONDAYS ARE HALF OFF FOOD (*drool*)	1
came here with a friend on a weekday for dinner<br><br>let me start with the good: the wait was not bad, the service was great, very attentive<br>bread was great, oil to dip bread in was better, would come back for the oil<br>my friend and i each got cocktails, the cucumber gin fizz and the elixir, good drinks!<br>we decided to split small plates, ordered the short rib sliders (yum!) and cheesesteak rolls<br><br>the meh: cheesesteak rolls didn&#39;t taste like cheesesteak, sauces were weird, but good enough that we finished the order<br><br>the disappointing: we also ordered the truffle mac, going off of yelp recommendations, and we were very excited. but the order was cold, it was very dry, there was no cheese, and there was no truffle flavor. whyyyy.	0
Cleo is easily one of my top restaurants I've ever eaten at - and I love to eat. Their take on food is an art form - each bite is absolutely mind blowing. Best oysters, wagyu beef, I've ever had. Do try it!	1
It is good. And our waiter was super nice. <br>The avocado toast was tasty. Could use a squeeze of like tho. To add a tang. <br>Hash browns were Delish. Kale was good too. Some pieces had a crisp that was cool.	1
The service is always Excellent - we always request Toni.We both had the Prime Rib which was again just like it always is...Perfect!.From the moment you walk in you are greeted - everyone is so nice and efficient.	1
I tried to order French Toast, but they said it only comes with the toast! I&#39;m like, da fuq? I can&#39;t get some eggs and sausage with them joints? And the toast alone costs $6.75. They trippin&#39;! Their service is amateur at best! When I walked thru the door, they asked if anyone was joining me. I said no, and dude pointed to the far back of the restaurant and said, &#34;sit on the right side!&#34; Keep in mind that the entire front of the place was empty! Needless to say, I ended up sitting up front. They had no physical menu to hand me. I had to read my order off of a wall that wasn&#39;t even comfortably located! Whenever I go to a new place and their menu selection sucks, I always resort to my ace in the whole, which is a cheese burger. But you know, had one burger, had &#39;em all! I asked if I can add pickles to my burger and this lady literally said, &#34;sorry, we don&#39;t have pickles honey!&#34; I was on the phone with my Lady while I was ordering, and all I heard her say is &#34;WHAT???&#34; Lol, my baby love pickles on her burgers. But for them to not have pickles at all is ridiculous. The lady didn&#39;t even say that they were simply out at the time; she made it seem like they just don&#39;t fuq with the pickles... I&#39;ll most likely never eat here again!	0
Even though I&#39;m reviewing this place now, I have been coming here for years. At one point it was my everyday place. I love this place. I love everything about it. The fact that is a small hole in the wall place (emphasis on small) the fact that everyone here is friendly and probably one of the coolest people you&#39;ll meet, the fact that the sushi is pretty darn good.	1
As a first timer to Vegas I once again turned to yelp for some help... I would say for Vegas this place is very reasonably priced considering the price of everything on and near the strip and casinos... If the food is worth the price I do not mind paying a little extra for fresher local ingredients... No farms, no food, it&#39;s simple... <br><br> I ordered the Ruben on focaccia. The corn beef was delicious thinly sliced and just the right amount on the sandwich. They use red cabbage, Russian dressing and Gruyere cheese. It also came with a small sample of strawberry apple salad which was delicious as well.. I really enjoyed the sandwich it was fresh and filled me up without making me feel heavy. My other got a blanco pide which is a much heavier dish because of all the cheese but he said the ingredients were fresh and the flavor combinations were really good. The pides are large and he could not finish it and brought it to the hotel and finished it later. We also ordered a morning wake up smoothie and it Was truly amazing!!! The drinks are a little pricey but all and all I feel for Vegas the food was fairly priced... $4.50 for coconut water? Holy moly! <br><br>The service was great fast and prompt. For a cafe the man running the register (maybe owner) checks on you through your meal to make sure all the food is good.	1
I had the mushroom burger late Thursday 9/8/11 night and I woke up sick on Friday. It continued through Saturday. I spent most of the day in bed and couldn't keep anything down. Stay away from this joint unless you want food poisoning.	0
and over priced when combined with poor service.	0
So, here&#39;s the thing.....<br><br>Thai BBQ may be a chain of Thai restaurants, it may not exactly be what one would call &#34;authentic&#34; Thai food, but who cares when commercial Thai cuisine tastes this good? I don&#39;t care if its canned Thai decor in this place, its just good.<br><br>I judge a Thai restaurant on two dishes, the Tom Yum Goong soup and Pad Sew Ew. These always have and always will be my fave Thai dishes. Thai BBQ does not disappoint, the Tom Yum Goong soup is perfectly balanced with kaffir lime leaves, chili pepper, and shrimp. Its a spicy, vinegary, refreshing treat, whenever I feel like I&#39;m sick, this soup does the trick.<br><br>Lets talk Pad Sew Ew, there have been restaurants all over town that have disappointed me with inconsistent noodles, too much sauce, not enough sauce, weird additions of totally unnecessary ingredients, and noodles that aren&#39;t the right size. However, if you are looking for a solid plate of Pad Sew Ew, hop up to the table, have your chop sticks ready and be ready for a flavor explosion in your mouth. The noodles are huge and flat and cooked to perfection, just the right amount of sauce, crisp brocilini, and a smattering of egg....<br><br>End the meal with some fried bananas or green tea ice cream....<br>Shut up. So good.	1
Literally, a hidden gem. No, seriously, it's hidden. Great little spot though. Happy Hour: M-F 3-7pm & all day Sunday gets you a Far Bar Burger with Wasabi Fries for $7. Not too bad, especially when the burger is deliciousness in your mouth! The wasabi I could probably do without. Pair that with a Sapporo draft for $3 or their craft pint of the day for $4 and you got yourself a party!	1
This place is for tourists who don&#39;t know any better, and for those fail to realize that you don&#39;t have to wait in line for an hour or more for downright mediocre food. In the two times I&#39;ve been here, I was not impressed with the food or the service, and I was especially disappointed with the snippy management who were berating customers who were asking to be seated. For better food AND service, go across the street to Tony&#39;s, where you won&#39;t leave with a headache.	0
Service and atmosphere was great. Food was overpriced and left something to be desired. Mac and cheese was lukewarm in middle. Taco platter was ok. Hot dog was just a hot dog but at ballpark prices. With all of the fantastic food options in the city, it might be worth trying some place else. But maybe it was just an off night.	0
Cool decor. Surly servers. Hot. Food was mediocre.	0
The food was not good. The service was ok. But the food needed flavor and there was none. Should have ask for my money back	0
Awesome brunch place!!!	1
In desperate need for good food but even better human interaction after what seemed like never-ending work schedule, JJ and I decided to come here on a Saturday night with a groupon in hand. The exterior isn't very exciting but once you enter inside, the artistic interior matched its museum row location. It was dark and romantic in a date kind of way but it was still good for friends to kick back and treat ourselves with good food. We started with a bowl of the COrn chowder soup. More on the watery side, it wasn't the traditional savory, fatty chowder I expected but this variation was a pleasant, lighter, full flavored version that we mutually agreed was just as good. The Magic Mushroom Pizza had large pieces of Wild Mushrooms and Brie Pizza with Truffled Creme Fraiche and Arugula. Pipping hot, it was cheesy and gooey with fresh pieces of arugula. After 30 minutes of conversation, it didn't taste as good (expectedly).The cast iron roasted pork chop was soft, tender, slightly juicy with sweet, warm Oven Roasted Peaches and pieces of Grilled Corn cut off a real cob and Arugula with Red Wine Jus mixed all in. For dessert, we had warm Truffled Chocolate Cake with Chocolate Gelato and a Blueberry Sauce. Rich and completely in chocolate heaven, we ooh'ed and ahh'ed with each bite of warm cake with cold gelato. The touch of blueberry added a small change that made it all-the-more fun to eat without making it too weird. Sitting in the restaurant made me forget for a few hours I was in Los Angeles, There was a very New York feeling to it with the decor that I really enjoyed. Oh, and playing Daft Punk, Foo Fighters, Postal Service, Modest Mouse, and Kings of Leon throughout the meal was just awesome.	1
I have been going to Luna Park for many years now, but after my last<br>experience I have sworn to never set foot in this place again. The former<br>manager Pamela was a pleasure to deal with, their new manager is a<br>complete asshole. I arrived early &amp; was meeting a friend, both of us<br>were ready to drop some serious cash. I informed the manager that<br>we needed to be seated outside &amp; no one else was there. I was informed<br>that a party of 20 would be arriving later, they never arrived while we were<br>there. We sat on the other side of the patio, to be sure not to disrupt the<br>party that I was earlier told about. At one point we were told we had to go,<br>still had food &amp; were waiting for our drinks to arrive. At one point in time I<br>would frequent this Luna Park at least three times a week, I have since told<br>everyone I know not to support this establishment. Then the manager told me<br>that I must of not understood his accent, give me a break. One other thing they<br>do keep raising their prices &amp; for me it&#39;s always been more about the location<br>of the establishment then their food.	0
The best excuse to come into a place like Commissary is to not have an excuse to come here. We weren't particularly hungry, didn't necessarily want to drink. But we'd been dying to come by and since we found ourselves right outside, that was the only excuse we needed.And I run into fellow Yelper and one of my "real life" personal Super Heros, Pam C., immediately outside the Line Hotel-- oh, but she's not going in, just yet. She's cycling past, has plans to swing by later. Of course you do Pam. =)The menus are simple graphics suggesting plate options. The trick is to not think so hard about it. The iced tea was fantastic, the Figs ($12.00) was this beautifully plated dish of figs, goat cheese, toasted hazelnuts (almonds?), sitting in a slightly spicy, zangy reduction. We paired that with grilled cheese sandwich ($12.00) and splash of tomato soup (yes, pickle on the side). It was so perfectly balanced and didn't leave us starving.Our tables were on the large patio, but on the other side of the (beautiful greenhouse) bar, there is a pool literally swimming with hipsters enjoying being so painfully god damn very cool looking. I feel like almost every person at Commissary comes with a hipster schtick that really is cooler than every other hipster you've ever seen. That IS impressive, especially while Commissary retains its sophistication.. Roy Choi, you've outdone yourself.	1
Burgers were ok, but there are crickets everywhere. And a hair in my roasted garlic aioli.	0
One of my favorite late night dives or Sunday Morning Brunch spots. They change up the menu every now and then - always with good additions.Brazilian Waffle- killer!Mole - awesomemost of the breakfast specials- awesomeSometimes the service is hit or miss depending on the time you go...But hey man, you can't beat a homemade Poptart.	1
We went in for a beer pit stop and ended up having a few rounds. Good music, great beer selection, and the bartenders were friendly, engaging and really nice. It was a nice time, good vibe. Would definitely give it a try if you&#39;re in the area.	1
Great place any time, but especially for happy hour. Burger or pork sliders are fabulous and adding 12 wings is the topper. The drink specials are great and are a super time to try higher end whiskey or Scotch, not to mention a good old Murphy's stout.	0
Don't mind if I fon-DO.	1
Very dissappointing. First time visitor, generally love Cuban food, was excited to try this place. As soon as we were seated, it all felt very rushed. Waiter wanted to take our entire order when he first stopped by for drinks. Apps came out almost instantly (which I didn&#39;t like, I wanted a more relaxing evening). Then the entres were served. My dining companion&#39;s meal was barely warm, but mine was ice cold! No joke. I sent it back, they appologized, but it pretty much ruined the evening. My dining companion ate his meal, then when mine came, I ate (alone). Makes you think just how freshly prepared any of the food is here. <br><br>You&#39;d do better to just pass on by this place. There are other wonderful Cuban restaurants in the area, no need to waste your evening on this place.	0
Went here for NYE with my wife and 2 friends.<br><br>I wouldn&#39;t call it a tapas place, but they do have a lot of appetizers. I had the very tasty shrimp risotto and short rib steak. My wife had the meatball appetizer which was pretty huge and the short rib appetizer which was also good. They had a well priced wine list and a separate vegan menu.	1
The food was good, the service was excellent, the ambience was different. I will definitely be going back.	0
Organic corn beef hash, yes please!I don't know where to start... I love this place. Hands down, the best corned beef I have ever had. I could cry thinking about it.Let me set the scene... We are in Culver City, on Inglewood Blvd to be exact, in a not so "friendly' looking neighborhood. But we are hungry and figure something would stand out as we drove along. We aren't from the area and expected to maybe, if we were lucky, see a Carls drive thru. Instead we see, to my delight, an Organic Cafe, across the street from a Vegan Restaurant. By far, extremely random!I yelp in excitement and we pull over the car. Side note bonus, they have a parking lot! That is rare in LA.The service was awesome, the bathroom clean, the food options... Amazing. We got fresh squeezed OJ, the organic Corned Beef Hash, and the Eggs Benny. Everything was great! Absolutely amazing. Fresh, wholesome and warm your soul good.	1
The chicken platter is hands down the best lunch deal in midtown. The wait is worth it.	1
It was the very first morning since I moved to San Francisco.It was a little foggy and a lot colder than I was used to at the time.So pho sounded great. Plus it was literally the closest restaurant to my apartment building.I ordered the vegan pho.It had broccoli, carrots, onion, mushrooms and fried tofu.Im not a very picky eater but it wasn't very good.The noodles tasted like they weren't cooked enough.They were all stuck together in my bowl.Even though it wasn't a meat based broth, I've had some pretty tasty vegan pho before.I had to put a lot of Sriracha and hoisin sauce in my broth to make it more flavorful.They were nice enough to cook my bean sprouts for me when I asked though.I won't eat here again unless it's the ONLY place open or something.	0
Have&#39;nt been here in a while since they opened and for my mother&#39;s birthday. Remembered that their portions were huge. We dined here because my wife forgot her key&#39;s and kids were in school near by so she ended up there.<br><br>They were still BYOB but heard they are about receive their liquor license as it will make things easier. The owner chef is awesome and the place is always quiet with regular customers.<br><br>They also have live music on certain nights and during christmas, they have exterior lighting which the neighborhood kids point at as they light the whole building with neon lights.<br><br>I ordered the chicken cutlet which was huge with pasta. They gave me rigatoni pasta which is very good and I could&#39;nt finish the plate. I eventually took it home but was able to feed myself for the next day lunch as well.<br><br>Very family friendly and nice. Price is very moderate and recommend to family with kids.	1
Stumbled into Le Marecage looking for a good place to kick off ladies night with a friend. We split the lamb and some smaller plates. It was too die for! Highly recommend the lamb and ask for extra sauce, you won&#39;t regret it.	1
We were very excited to try his Vegas place.. Boy what a big let down!<br><br>Did not get anything that was impressive what so ever! Not going there again! Over!	0
My wife and I had dinner at The Wood for the first time and it was a great experience: the service was good, the food was outstanding and the ambiance in the outdoors area was great.I only give it 4 stars because the price is in my opinion too steep.	1
I started eating at The Picnic Basket a little while ago and I have to say that it&#39;s quickly become my new favorite place to go for lunch. The staff is extremely polite and friendly and they have a good selection of healthy, yet delicious sandwiches, soups and salads.<br><br>I would highly recommend this place to anyone in the area looking for a good breakfast or lunch; and try the Crunchy Tuna, it&#39;s amazing!	1
Hands down the best Fish & Chips and Fish Sandwich in L.A. Savory perfectly battered fish and amazing thin crisp fries. Toasted fresh bread smothered in incredible house made tartar sauce that's addicting good, filled with freshly battered fried fish. Amazing! Enjoyed every bit of it.And are you people legit crazy to be complaining about the price of their $18 lobster roll? Do you not see the amount of lobster that's packed in it? And complaining it's too expensive for a sit down restaurant (they have rent to pay) yet you're willing to pay for it at a truck? You people straight up have issues. God forbid you see the prices at Connie and Ted's where it costs $26. If you can't afford it, don't eat it!	1
I ordered the Turkey Omelette and potatoes and I sat there and ate until there was none left! I&#39;m not into the overcrowded, vintage style restaurant but it was worth it.	1
Even if I don&#39;t have the best experience eating out, I&#39;m not the sort of person who feels inclined to pan a restaurant. I&#39;ve certainly never been moved to write a review, let alone post one online. Until now. The dinner we had at Catfish last night was underwhelming, unappetizing, and frankly, not that cheap. Hence, the following review.<br><br>We arrived at Catfish around 8:30 on a Monday night. Since it was on the late side for dinner, it was understandable that the restaurant had run out of some of its main dishes. But only being able to offer half the dishes on the menu was a surprise. I had hoped to try the roasted chicken with biscuits and green beans, the BBQ pulled pork on brioche, the jambalaya, or the roast beef po&#39; boy. I even could have gone for the alligator bayou burger. But no dice. I&#39;m surprised we&#39;re still open, our server told us in a moment of candor.<br><br>Finally we both decided on the catfish po&#39; boy -- in part because we were told the fish was local-ish, from a Virginia farm. But much to our disappointment, there was only one filet left. So it would be one catfish po&#39;boy then. I settled on an order of gumbo. Though the dish seemed overpriced at $16, it promised crab, andouille sausage, shrimp, vegetables, rice and a baguette. I also ordered a side of biscuits since no southern meal is truly complete without them.<br><br>Then we waited, sipping our very reasonably priced bourbon. <br><br>We should have stuck to the spirits. Because when the catfish po&#39; boy arrived, it was cold and lacked flavor. The fish -- which was grilled perhaps, certainly not fried -- was a little slimy in texture and stuffed in a giant baguette. A heavy, pungent smokiness pervaded the soupy gumbo, leading us to think this must have been the dregs of the pot. I could not find a single bit of crab in my bowl, just a few lonely pieces of shrimp and andouille sausage. The biscuits were hot but more like dinner rolls or scones -- as one earlier reviewer mentioned -- and had no lightness or flakiness to them. The sweet whipped butter that accompanied them seemed out of place. <br><br>Perhaps we had an especially bad experience. But to be on the safe side, I recommend ordering only from the bourbon list, which actually does include several good southern whiskeys. Give the food a pass.	0
The view was amazing. The services was ok. The food was moderate at best lamb that was too greasy, wine with bottom of the bottle residue in the glass. And the dessert was almost not eatable. 200 $ bill for 2. Not up to par to European standards. Sorry.	0
What&#39;s all the Smoque about? Nothing to write home to your grill about.<br><br>The End.	0
we had lots of appetizers and pasta entrees. Everything was REALLY salty. I had to wash it all down with pitchers of water and coke...	0
Make sure you find out up front what they charge for doing a split check before you order. <br>Also check to see if they&#39;ve included gratuity (even for 2 people) on the bill.	0
I walked in with my bf 9PM today (1/13/2012) and the front girl looked up and down us and said this is not place for us. I wore a jean cause it was casual friday for our company. I think she just figured that we can&#39;t afford food from there. But I&#39;m sure I make more money than she. She were pretty nasty and it was the first time I got race discrimination in public. (FYI I&#39;m an Asian.) So embarassed. If you are an Asian or if you think they &#39;MIGHT&#39; discriminate against the race I highly recommend not to go there. They totally ruined our friday date.	0
The owner of Turks &amp; Frogs in the West Village rolls the dice and wins big with this new spot. VL charms you with aromas and flavors of the Levant. A dash of hip and sexy are added to the ambiance.	1
I fell in love with this place as soon as it opened when I lived nearby, but I still go back when time and weather permit. Small and cozy, lovely decor, very relaxed. The food is delicious and very reasonably priced. And the staff are extremely friendly. A real gem.	1
Delicious food, great service. I am recommending this place to everyone!	1
Been here twice for lunch now...Experience: overall, very pleasant - the servers were all very polite and accomodating. The place is nice, although music a bit on the loud side - however, still not too loud where you find yourself yelling to table mates. The bar seems to have a nice assortment of beers and other drinks - too bad I couldn't have one!Food: First time I had the tomato soup, while the second time I had the gumbo. Both dishes were excellent. The one thing I would suggest is they serve some bread to people that are going to be eating lunch, as the gumbo has almost no starch. However, when I asked for a side they happily brought it to our table.Overall, great experience and definintely a place I will try again!	1
This place has the most extensive happy hour menu that I have ever seen. The menu has many affordable options from a $7 foie gras to a delicious fried chicken sampler for the same price. I was thoroughly impressed by the decor. There is an assortment of wall mounted tea candles that really give the restaurant a surreal and magical vibe. Overall, this is a great place to hit up during a night on the town. Drink a few delicious beers and have some amazing food that doesn't break your bank.	0
I went there with a group of friends for my first time on Saturday, it was busy and the decor was nice. That&#39;s about it! Everything went downhill from there, we had a reservation and took us 45 min to sit (reservation pointless) to order a few drinks took another 20-30 min. I then ordered a few appetizers for the table including shrimp ceviche which was ok. For main course I wanted to do the octopus and a snapper to share, server came back after 20 min saying they were out of snapper so I went with the milanesa (over fried chicken with Canned spicy tomato sauce on top) the octopus was also way overcooked and tasteless. I give it two stars for ambiance, service was awful so was valet. It took us 45 min to get our check! I refuse to waste money, there are way better options in Miami.	0
Last visit was a major disappointment based solely on the service and the way it was poorly handled. I did a carry out, waited 25 minutes, and no one acknowledged me. They were empty, had three guys at the counter, and were filling a large order for later. I left after half an hour empty handed.<br><br>Called the owner the next day to let her know of unacceptable visit, so she said she would issue a credit next visit and took my info. Month later, i called in advance to confirm and it took a 20 min delay waiting on the phone and no one could locate. They told me to call back in an hour for the manager. I did that, she had me on hold another 15 mins and said she could not find so call tomorrow for exec management. Poor excuse for service, will not return as they could care less about the customer and are way disorganized.	0
Stopped on for Breakfast. Nice atmosphere, lots of outside seating. Breakfast was great, polite staff and really not that expensive...	1
Love this place. It&#39;s probably what you would call a hole in the wall, but aren&#39;t those places usually the best? Both owners, wonderful people, always remember you, always smile and always go out of their way to accommodate you. You want to swap sides? No problem. I always eat lamb strips over Basati rice with lentils and roasted onions. I swap the cucumber sauce with a homemade red sauce with lots of garlic and sauteed onions.... Too big to eat and I take it home for only $6. I top it off with homemade tapioca pudding, topped with cinnamon and Pistachios. Sometimes I go in for a morning bagel. They recently switched to a different bakery and man..... those bagels are phenomenal. You can get them plain, cream cheese, different kind of egg sandwiches or some unusual ones such as the Hudson, which is Salmon, Cream Cheese, Capers and Cucumbers. Such a treat. Hope they will be around for a while since the economy is tough and lots of places around them don&#39;t make it. Location is good, NW corner of Lone Mountain and Decatur, right across from Vons. Go there and see for yourself that the smallest places usually come with the biggest surprises.	1
Good coffee, big windows, diverse crowd.<br>Not loaded with hipsters (Silverlake) or <br>yuppies (Santa Monica).	1
Great place to go for a drink in the evening. Stopped in on Halloween eve, and it was rather empty. Went to the bar, ordered drinks, and sat down on one of the chairs outside. Was warmish thanks to the patio heaters they have spread out all around the tables. The view was nice, kinda makes you feel like you&#39;re out of the city. Someone mentioned loud music, and I personally liked that as it removed ambient noise from the outside which made it feel even more like &#34;getting away&#34;.<br><br>I live down the block, so I will probably be checking out this spot for a little while, until it starts to get more popular... and most probably harder to get into (or a table).<br><br>Staff was on par, always there to fill water and ask if we were fine. Maybe a bit &#34;over-staffed&#34; that particular night? Who knows, lots of servers/waitresses running around. There is also a fire pit further down (past the pool), did not make it down there. But it looked like a good place to warm up these cold nights.<br><br>We did not order much food, just a desert and some fries, both were good. May come back here for dinner and update. <br><br>I was really impressed with this spot, and recommend checking it out if you&#39;re in the area. This side of town isn&#39;t the hottest spot, but like many other people are saying, Wilshire is up-and-coming. So who knows, may be a hot spot very soon.<br><br>Just one note... there are only two bathrooms upstairs on the rooftop. One stall for men, and one for women. The bathroom is nicely designed, but the sinks are damn tiny. I can see there be a waiting line for the bathrooms, unless there are some directly downstairs for customers to use (non-guests).<br><br>Will be back...	1
I don&#39;t see what all the Hype of this place Sorry.<br><br>I went on a Sunday with my mom from Kendal. It was a nice day for a drive to the Beach and get some food.<br><br>We got there very easily. Hardly any traffic on the road at noon time. I parked across the street cause they don&#39;t have a private lot or garage. Crossing the street we almost got hit by a speeding car. Drivers around that area don&#39;t yield to Pedestrians! We get to the restaurant and noticed that most of the seating is outdoors. It has some indoor tables but they are high tables with stools and is uncomfortable for seniors like my Mom. We sat in the patio and it has to be Redone. Th cement floor is uneven, full of cracks, and slopes. The chairs were dirty and very unstable. I felt like I was gonna break the chair and so did my Mom. The service was ok nothing to write home about.<br><br>We started off with the Andiamo salad and it was OK. Lettuce with mushrooms, peppers, olives, and tomatoes with their house dressing. Then we ordered a 14 in pizza with half cheese and the other half with God farther topping. Looks good on paper but that&#39;s it! We got the pizza and i served my mom a plain slice and I had one of the Godfather slices.The pizza was under cooked and my God farther pizza half had most of the toppings on one slice and the other two had hardly any toppings. It&#39;s like it was made in a Rush when the place was empty. I wont be going here again any time soon.	0
Had a dinner reservation for three at 8:15pm, wasn&#39;t seated until 8:45pm (overbooked tables) and was seated in an area that was normally for lounging (seats were way lower than the tables). Band was unusually loud due to the location, and people were standing/hovering during our whole dinner. Service was also spotty as we had to request for bread 3x and rarely refilled water glasses. Although the first visit was lovely, after this second experience won&#39;t be coming back anytime soon.	0
Grabbed a late dinner before heading to the wellesbourne for some drinks. It's a cute dinner joint with red twisty chairs and the kitchen is in the center so you can see everything. It's seat yourself and luckily it was only two of us so we spotted two end seats. Everything is fast so people come, eat, and go. My bf and I both got the steak burger with cheese and shared an order of fries. Wanted to try the apple pie or the banana cream pie afterwards but they already sold out of it since we came around 10ish at night. It's all good though! We just have to come back! The fries came out fast and then the two burgers. It seems like a fast food joint but sitting down style. The steak burgers were good! Meaty & juicy and the cheese yum! Adding the cheese was extra which was .50 but totally worth it. The fries were crispy & golden and went nicely well with the good ol' heinz ketchup in the glass bottle. We ate it pretty fast and off to the next destination!	1
Don&#39;t be fooled by their simplistic name. Far Bar is much more than just a bar. They feature delicious full entrees along with interesting and tasty cocktails. I&#39;m a huge fan of their wasabi fries and pork tacos.	1
Totally mind-blowing meal at Ray&#39;s after being wowed by Levitated Mass. The black pasta and the farro were elegant and understated with wonderful flavor complexity and integration. Service was attentive without being overbearing. I loved being able to order excellent wine by the carafe.<br><br>Remember to save room for dessert!	1
First time going, I had to get their "famous" dish which is Kai Yang (Thai BBQ Chicken). Even states that has been an LA favorite for over 30 yrs on the menu. With that statement, I had to give it a shot. The BBQ Chicken came with BBQ honey sauce that reminded me of sweet & sour sauce. Their "shrimp" Thai fried rice wasn't all that great. I say "shrimp" cuz it only had 2 pieces. My cuz also only had 2 pieces. Also it wasn't that flavorful. The BBQ Chicken was tender and flavorful. The Angel Wings were also good, IMO better than the BBQ Chicken. Sadly, I couldn't look past the "Shrimp" Fried Rice. The words of hype did say the CHICKEN has been an LA fav not the rice. So they lived up to that part. BBQ Chicken & Angel Wings: 3.5 Stars Rice: 1 Star	0
I've read so many reviews about the Salt and Pepper Crab so I decided to bring my out of town guest and try this place out.Yipes! Super disappointed.I'm just going to say, I couldn't get over the overwhelming taste of the oil from which the crab was deep fried in. The crab nor they batter tasted like salt or pepper..... just oil. Sadly, after the first bite I was done.I might come back and try the steamed crab with garlic but I think I may just stick to Thanh Long and PPQ.Good luck folks but I probably won't be returning to this establishment.	0
I remember driving by The Pantry when I was a kid with my family. It looks identical from then to now. I remember lines down the street to get in. That's good business.It opened in 1924 and it's still going strong. Eleven more years until its 100th anniversary celebration. Former Mayor Richard Riordan owns it. He always seemed like a good mayor -- put education first.It was on my lifetime wish list. Wish fulfilled.Walked in and it's exactly what I expected. They hadn't opened the counter yet (not until 9 a.m.) so unfortunately had to grab a two-seat table by myself.It's a neat greasy spoon cafe, ideal for breakfast. I ordered the #4 -- 2 eggs, 2 French Toast slices, 2 sausage patties and potatoes. Yeah, way too much food for one person so I just went for tastes until I was full. I ended up eating all but the potatoes. The food was delicious.I like being anywhere in L.A. where it feels like it's the same as a long time ago and this fulfills that experience without being a re-creation like Johnny Rockets.(I was confused about one thing on the menu (menus are on the wall only) -- one place on the menu said coffee or tea was $0.50 and another said $1.95. I was charged the higher amount. Didn't really care. I got two refills.)They only accept cash so leave the credit card at home ... or at least you can't use it here.People were taking a lot of photos of themselves and the restaurant. That says a lot. These didn't look like tourists in from another part of the country or world.While the food is comparable to other similar restaurants, the nostalgia and reputation make it a special experience.	1
What happened to this place? My brother took me to dinner here a week ago for my birthday. You walk in and there is a sarcastic sign about their seating policy. Then you are not greeted instead slammed with do you have reservations. The food was the worst that I have had in a lomg time. Metropolitioan market has better sushi and their menunis sterile of information. You are not allowed to know what may be in the Bento Box and if you really like Japenese cusine this is no longer the place.....very sad.	0
I have been to other Stregas and found them to have better atmosphere and better food.  This location feels a little like the land that time forgot.  Perfectly fine but nothing special	0
Had the haejang gook. Was definitely good. But the best thing was the rice. It was so good, I could have eaten it all alone! The crispy rice at the end with hot barley tea hit the spot! Yum!	1
Heard some good things about this place and decided to head over and try it out. The decor is interesting, wooden shoe inserts hanging from the ceiling. The music was super random and all songs that were familiar. The guacamole and chips were brought out first and were really yummy. I ordered the breakfast taco, which was surprisingly delicious. I was full with just the chips and the one taco. Had to take my other taco to go. The coffee and tacos and guac was a weird combo, but it all worked! Would definitely go back to try other items on the menu!	1
Delicious paella! Warm hospitality! And VERY warm hosts!	1
Food is very good and filling. Staff is friendly and laid back.	1
It&#39;s obvious that most of these good reviews on this restaurant was written by friends and family. We went last night and I was appalled that they did not give me any oyster utensils. If you are going to serve oysters and on your main menu, you should have proper utensils. Oysters were not shucked properly. Lots of shells on the oysters along with a bland sauce.<br>The chicken was terrible. The beets were bland. Another Union street disaster...	0
The best burgers I've tried! I never want to eat the last bite! I wish they were bigger haha. =)	1
Commissary is one of those restaurants that's perfect for lunch or dinner because it's set up is a like a greenhouse and definitely has a trendy feel to it. My friend and I came for lunch on a Sunday, and immediately loved the set up once we came in. Their menu is literally photos with names of the main dish they will be serving and you just go with your gut from there and pick away. It was definitely different to have to pick dishes based on photos. it made the experience that more interesting. The dishes that stood out to me the most that I feel are must tries, is the BRUSSEL SPROUTS, CARROTS, and DEVILED EGGS. Check it out!! ENJOY!	1
Took over 2 hours to deliver, they forgot some of my order, and the food wasn't even that good. BBQ pork was extremely over cooked, the pot stickers did not have the thin layer, it was very thick and they weren't pan fried, they were legitimately fried (way too much at that), the wontons in the soup had no filling in them at all, it was just dough. I'm not pleased at all, they may have 5 stars on grub hub (which is why I tried them) but id give them less than one star if I could.	0
Really over-rated. I had the roasted chicken and risotto and it honestly tasted like cafeteria food. I cook and bake pretty consistently and it was well below anything I&#39;ve ever tried and failed in preparing. The drinks were okay... The Writers Block tasted like Sprite and vodka with lemon and sugar. Meh, no need to ever go back. The view was nice but sooooo not worth the $120 bill for 2 people.	0
Kimchi-To-Die-For<br><br>Keungama literally means Large Pot. They stew their sullongtang in their large pot the size of a bathtub and stew it for hours and hours.<br><br>Yea yea...service can be better, but you&#39;ll find pretty much the same service in most Korean restaurants in L.A. (I&#39;ve definitely had worse in 50%+ of my experiences in &#39;traditional&#39; Korean restaurants.) but nothing to really complain about (except I do see a few exceptionally bad cases on the reviews here) In Korea, there are restaurants where they are known for the Cussing-Old-Lady which is the HIGHLIGHT of their experience.<br><br>As for the good part, I love their sullongtang and their Spicy Galbi Jjim. I have experienced a minor inconsistency in the Spicy Galbi Jjim but it was still good both times. Their Kimchi and Ggakddugi is TO-DIE-FOR!!! Don&#39;t cut it with the scissors rip it apart with your chopsticks and eat it like string-cheese(?) <br><br>All in all, $6 for sullongtang with some bomb ass ggakdduki with at-par service, I&#39;d go here any day for an authentic Korean sullongtang.	1
My husband and I used to go to the Great Dane at Hilldale on a regular basis since they opened. Although the beer is mediocre, with the exception of Crop Circle Wheat, it's a convenient location. Somewhere to go for a beer and a bite after seeing a movie at Sundance. However, the last two times that we've gone there have left a bad taste in our mouths, figuratively. It seems like the current mantra is to make as much money as possible and who cares about the customer. One meal we had four extra charges: sweet potatoe fries=extra, mayo on our burgers=extra, Imperial IPA=extra, grass-fed beef=extra. Only two of the extra charges were actually listed on the menu. This afternoon, after having two tastes of beers (one each) and then ordering two 20 oz. beers plus an appetizer, I asked for a taste of another beer because I thought we would split one more beer before going home. The bartender refused saying because it's a guest beer (although on tap) they don't make as much money so they don't let people taste the beer. That seemed ridiculous. Why offer guest beers then? So, it's okay if a customer spends $5 on a beer that they might not like, but the Great Dane can't spend a few cents on a taste? We're talking about a taste, not a glass. When we called the bartender on it, he said he was being very patient with us by explaining the different beers that we had asked him about as well as explaining about two of the sauces offered for chicken wings. Unbelievable! Isn't that his job? By the way, there were two other people sitting at the bar, not a big crowd. Anyway, I will not go there again no matter how convenient. There are places with better beer and better customer service where they aren't constantly nickel and dimeing you.	1
Just went here with my housemate for a little hangover food. I ordered the Pastrami Breakfast Sandwich and it was fantastic. Very delicious. No wait at all, which was surprising considering it was Sunday morning. I've been here once before, it's classic! Just order something pastrami!	1
With so many LESS than spectacular dining options in the OCMD, from poorly run chain restaurants to schlocky local restaurants it is an absolute comfort to know that a first class, well run, Ruth's Chris is an option in the village of Glen Riddle.  Five of us sampled from both the chef's special menu and the regular menu and every plate went back to the kitchen empty.  From the New York Strip, to the PorterHouse for two, to the Surf &amp; Turf to the Cowboy Rib-eye.  Each dish cooked perfectly to order and expertly handled by a terrific and well trained wait staff.  The wine list offered a few subtle surprises, but the best surprise were the fair prices versus retail and our server knew to decant prior to serving same.  Exceptional find in OCMD	0
GET OUT OF THE HOTEL	1
Nice atmosphere, if a bit cavernous. The food was very tasty, although the farm plates are bigger than you expect - we over ordered! The Spicy Stewed Sweet Potato and Avocado Fries were to die for! However, everything was quite salty which we weren&#39;t a fan of...less seasoning people!	1
I cant believe I haven't written a review for list. THIS IS MY FAVORITE SPOT in Seattle! Belive me, we as foodies have eaten over 350 establishments in seattle and List still tops the list for food, and value! The gnocchi and pheasant are our favorites, but seriously, GO HERE else you are missing out !!	0
I am sorry but the food is average (at best), other diners here had not bathed in weeks and just reeked, the location is just awful. I would rather eat at mel's diner which says alot.	0
I went to eat there because someone said to me taht it was very good. First I called to make a reservation for four and they told me they didn&#39;t took reservations and when I arrived they told me that everything was reserved hahaha weird but ok. We ordered the salumi platter and cheese and some octopus as an apetizer and they were &#34;ok&#34; the octopus could have used more salt on it. Then I oredered one of the specials wich was &#34;tagliatele with sea urchin&#34; the pasta was very chewy and soft and it smeeled like seafood but you could only taste the tomato. A friend of mine ordered the cavatelli and they were extremelly overcooked it was like eating potato puree. The food was less than what I has expected probably just bad luck, but with so many italian restaurants around I&#39;ll probably wont go again.	0

Always a great breakfast or late night stop. Usually once per week after work I will go, dine, then hit the deli and bakery afterwards to pickup a weeks worth of salads, meats &amp; cheese&#39;s and great breads. <br><br>I always start with cheese fries w/side of ranch and brown gravy. Then potato pancakes with extra apple sauce. After that, it&#39;s always a toss up of what to get. Always ask what the local fav&#39;s are!	1

Truly the best Chicago deep dish pizza in town! (not to be confused with Chicago stuffed) Keeps me from missing the Medici and Uno/Due too much!	1
The first time I came here everything was great the service the salad I ordered everything.. This last time I came for lunch it took us 30 min to get just a simple salad then when the salad arrived it was lacking dressing and the chicken was burnt and dry.. Then when it was time for the bill we had to flag down the waitress to get it, then after 10 min of waiting for her to take the bill we just went up front to pay.	0
Amazing food. Interesting and delicious.	1
BEST HOLE IN THE WALL COMFORT FOOD IN KTOWN!This place is so bomb. It is simple but really yummy. The food is made by Korean grandmas and moms stewing up yummy in my tummy magic soup. I usually get both the abalone porridge and ginseng chicken soup to share between two people. Obviously both of these things come out piping hot so it is perfect for a cold winter night. However, I love soupy things and I even enjoy this when it is 100 degrees in LA. Service depends on the hour of the day. If you go earlier in the day, the waitresses are usually nicer, but if it is later in the night, they may be a little tired and grumpy. A lot of other Yelpers said this is good post-clubbing and partying food and I am so down to try it next time after a night out in Ktown or LA or the morning after.	1
Well unfortunately our experience is not starting out on the right foot. I had planned and chosen this restaurant based on the reviews and the &#34;supposed&#34; high level of service for our anniversary. After making the reservation online, I called to verify and the person I spoke with told me that Opentable had an issue and that they had to move our reservation. This was not that big of a deal but when I also asked about the limo service, I was told, it would not be available and to take a taxi. For the experience I was hoping for, not too pleased so far!	0
I&#39;m an extreme inner fatty. If I really let myself go, I have no problem acknowledging the fact that I&#39;d probably be 400+ lbs. On a 5&#39;2 frame. I was super excited to try out the Redhead to indulge said inner fatty bc fried chicken is probably one of my favorite meals ever!<br><br>Unfortunately, I was pretty let down by The Redhead. I felt that their chicken was lacking in flavor, and the grits weren&#39;t super impressive. I had hoped that the peanut brittle would be its&#39; saving grace, but no can do. With a pleathora of places in NYC for me to get my fried chicken on, sad to say it won&#39;t be from here.	0
The food was good. But the customer experience in this location is poor. They are too busy to want to provide a good quality experience. There food is way too expensive to be rushed and hurried out the door. I would rather patronize a business that appreciates my dollars.	0
I went on a Friday night with some friends after dinner. The bar wasn&#39;t packed but there were a number of people inside near the bar, upstairs in the loft and out on the patio.<br>The setting was dark and relaxed with a modern rustic feel. There is a good selection of draft beer, wines as well as hard liquor and The staff is very friendly. I would definitely go back. <br><br>Atmosphere: 8/10<br>Drinks: 8/10<br>Service: 8/10	1
Came here for brunch this past Saturday with the bf. You need to make reservations for brunch on a weekend, because we didn't and our only option was the communal table. Which was fine but if you want to be seated right away and/or have your own space, then you need the reservations. They may have been understaffed when we went, but even so I felt a bit more neglected than most during my meal there. I saw some of the staff continually approaching certain tables, maybe regulars or friends, and making sure they were all ok and enjoying themselves, while I had to try to flag someone down for a good 10 minutes to get the check. And we didn't get our water that we requested until the end of our meal. The food itself was mediocre, nothing to write home about. I got the haystack, which were french fries piled with a hamburger, gravy, and onions on top. The bf got the huevros rancheros, which was pretty standards as well, though the plating was pretty. Overall, I don't think I'll be returning to this restaurant anytime soon.	0
Why is there a line for this place at the most absurd hours? I understand the 24/7 appeal, but the food was honestly very mediocre. I&#39;d rather go to a Denny&#39;s. At least I&#39;d be saving some money that way.<br><br>Overpriced and overhyped... And to make things worse, it&#39;s cash only. I say nah.	0
This review is for lunch only - however I've been to Anastasia for dinner and drinks before. The bar scene is super fun.I took a business contact to lunch at Anastasia and was very pleased with the meal we received. We started with the bruchetta sampler, which was a homerun. I had the seafood pasta for my entree and was very impressed. Many restaurants skimp on the seafood, but that's not the case with Anastasia! Very very pleased. My colleague had pizza, which she enjoyed immensely. In addition to the great food, the service was top-notch.	0
After reading the reviews here on yelp, when deciding on where to go in Fremont, I encouraged my friends to try this place. As expected, the line was long and the establishment reminded me of a Taco Truck that was built into a building. This was a pleasant surprise, and the sunny day did help too! There were a few tables, but don't expect to be seated by any means. The greatest thing was DEFINITELY the food, without a doubt. As a self-described foodie, or more eloquently poised as a gourmand, you could have put me in torrential rains in the longest line ever and I would still anticipate the taste of their delicious food. As I am from Tacoma, I would soooooooooo return to Fremont just for Paseo's! And what's really cool is that you can phone in an order, pick it up, and it's hot an fresh when you arrive! I think I may do that whenever I head back, which gives me a reason to invest in a bluetooth headset...	0
I&#39;m not a foodie, and I rarely get excited about restaurants. However, anything with the word cheese in the title is an instant allure for me. Seriously, you could call something Taxes and Cheese and I&#39;d be intrigued. So when I saw the sign Cheese Course go up, I kept an eye out and eagerly awaited this place to open. And it FINALLY did, and I FINALLY got the chance to stuff myself full of cheese. Hello, yum. Today&#39;s trip (I plan to go back time and time again) was packed with a fancy schmancy grilled cheese stuffed with tomato pesto and something with olives in it. I don&#39;t even like pesto or olives, but I LOVED this sandwich. I accessorized my sammie with broccoli cheese soup that WAS TO DIE FOR. Get the soup, just do it. You&#39;ll be glad you did. I brought my tot along with me, and she did great, plus the staff didn&#39;t complain about her dumping her puffs all over the floor. (She&#39;s a toddler, cut her some slack.) My only beef, the guy behind the counter was new and made it obvious he was new. He took forever and 10 years to find the button for our sandwiches on the cash register and that was a tad frustrating. But hopefully he&#39;ll catch on sooner than later, and I&#39;m willing to overlook this little bump in the road because the food was oh so good.	1
Get the Hickoryburger. I'm going to say it again: Hickoryburger! Everything is good at The Apple Pan, but the Hickoryburger is fantastic.Aside from that, the fries are alright, and the pies are excellent. Don't set your expectations too high, however. This place is as casual as can be, with bar seating and hordes of people leanings against the walls, waiting for seating to become available during the busier hours. Oh, and it's cash only, so come prepared! If none of that bothers you, you're in for a treat when you dine at The Apple Pan. And just in case you weren't paying attention...HICKORYBURGER!!!	1
I wish I could give this place less than one star. This was the worst experience I have ever had at a bar.<br><br>I came here with friends on a Saturday night. There was no one checking IDs at the door, but the bartender asked to see them when my friends ordered. We&#39;re 23, yet the bartender accused them of having fake IDs. His exact quote was, &#34;There&#39;s no way this is you&#34; (even though it was). I wasn&#39;t drinking, and yet he asked to see my ID and also accused me of using a fake. Again, to be clear, these are legitimate IDs. I try to assure him that they are real, and he sarcastically notes, &#34;Oh, I guess if you promise.&#34; He finally serves my friends with a roll of his eyes. We go to sit on stools towards the end of the bar, and quickly get reprimanded by another employee for trying to go to the garden, which was closed, even though that&#39;s not where we were headed.<br><br>Overall, the employees, particularly the bartender, were condescending and rude. I will never return here. I recommend heading to a bar with employees who have actually learned the meaning of customer service.	0
Definitely not the best Lebanese food I've had but you get lots of it and decent.	1
We had a party here of 10 people last night, this place was very accommodating! We had a great, very sweet and patient waitress!! Our food came quickly, correctly and was delicious! I def recommend trying all the veggies as starters! The burrata was so soft it melted in my mouth, just great.	1
We found this place on yelp and decided to check in out while in Vegas. First, it&#39;s right next to Encore in a small shopping plaza and it can be easy to miss if you&#39;re not looking carefully. We got here at a descent hour and we had to wait a few minutes to be seated. The place was a nice spot with these low sitting couches and chairs and there was loud club music blaring. The hookahs were huge about 4 feet tall, so careful not to knock it over. Overall it was kind of a strange experience, the hookah was pretty good and the guys were okay about refilling and replacing the coals, but I felt they were more attentive to tables that were shedding out more money with more people. But hey that&#39;s vegas right. It was kind of hard to talk to our friends in this place because the music was so loud! So just know that if you&#39;re coming here to chill and have some hookah you might not be able to talk to them.	1
please dont come here!!! everything is so amazing that i dont want you to have a piece of all the happiness i get from eating here. they douse the food with magic unicorn dust and its my fav place in all of la to have brunch - go away and get off my lawn!!!!!	1
De-ricious!<br><br>So being a husband of a pregnant wife, I had to cheat and sneak off the Little Tokyo to get my sushi on. I found a street parking spot and threw 3 bucks in for a hour of parking. I rushed around the Little Tokyo Plaza and went into the first sushi joint I saw. I&#39;m glad this was the first place I stumbled on. <br><br>I was worried about the place being a pricey tourist trap. But it turned out to be pretty legit. <br>The crowd was random. Half of patrons were tourist. The other half seemed like Japanese regulars. The meal cost $39 bucks with tip/tax included. <br><br>I sat at the bar and went for the Nigiri Sushi Combo B (7 sushi + 1 smelt egg). Since I don&#39;t know the next time I could sneak out again, I also got a side of sweet shrimp (with deep fried heads) and Uni Nigiri. The fish was generously cut and very fresh. The fish to rice ratio was absolutely ridiculous. It&#39;s pretty much sashimi with a dab of rice. I was absolutely stuffed and had to &#34;roll&#34; out of here. <br><br>My street creds:<br>I first got into cooking &amp; food when I was in college. After being rejected by numerous girls and getting zero action, I decided it was time for a change. I needed a new makeover to boost my geeky image. I applied for a cooking position at a Mediterranean-Italian Restaurant near my home and learned to cook all sorts of dishes. I never became a professional chef, but I continue to enjoy &amp; love food. 9 years later and 55 lbs heavier, I have a new passion for traveling and trying different foods around the world.	1
Absolutely hands down amazing. I have been twice and both times exceeded my expectations and those of my guests. The wait staff is knowledgeable about the entire menu and many drinks. The service was quick and the food was delicious.	0
Love this place. What can be better then a beer and peanuts followed by a great steak. Jimmy Mac's has a great steak cooked the way you like. And the rolls with the honey butter. Tasty... Always leave full and happy.	1
Fabulous food and the friendliest of service. Chef Felipe makes you feel like you are the most special customer. Our waiter, Juan, was overwhelmed with several tables and yet he still had lots of charisma and charm. He was delightful.<br>The restaurant could use another waiter.<br>Jamon Jamon Jamon is tops on my list for recommendations.	1
I have been to Bin 18 now 3 times with last night being the third time. Each time, I have found the wine and food to be spot on. Unfortunately the service is not as consistent! Twice now I have been served by a young girl who either has never received a day of training in her life or is just completely clueless. She knows nothing about the wine, food or service! First she took our menus away before we could even order our food, then she took forever to take our order and could not answer the simplest questions about the menu. We were forced to pour our own wine the entire evening. She even stood at the table and watched us pour our wine while making a joke about how we were doing so; absurd!!!!! Unfortunately my friend and I have now had the pleasure of sitting with this &#34;server&#34; twice. As much as I like Bin 18, I hope this does not continue to happen!	0
Being my first ever Acai Bowl..I think Amazebowl did a good job at introducing me to this phenomenon and LA staple.<br><br>I excitedly found amazebowls parked close to campus at USC and I made my trek over for lunch.<br><br>With only a few hundred calories, I would say amazebowls is definitely a healthy choice given that it&#39;s not too sweet, filled with fruit, and very refreshing.<br><br>The original came out to be around $6.40 with acai, fruit, and lots of other toppings. If you&#39;re a newbie, this would be a good intro. I would have to say that I was expecting the bowl to be more tart/sweet but the flavor is actually more subtle and more smoothie like.<br><br>Not sure how often I would get it, but on a hot day, this is a very good treat.	1
$20 for a bowl of laksa three chicken skewers 2 cups of unseasoned white rice and weird slaw dressed with pineapple juice. That wouldn't be a deal even if the food were twice as good.	0
I was truly disappointed by my experience at Puerto Viejo. My friend had come here before and really enjoyed the food, but the food was nothing special. We had some empanadas to start, then I had the pernil and maduros as a main. The pork was dry and a bit gristly (can meat actually be both of those things at once?), and the plantains were okay but overcooked/mushy and overly sweet. While it wasn&#39;t the worst meal I&#39;ve ever had, it certainly wasn&#39;t worth twenty-some dollars. The empanadas were fine, though, and I can see how they&#39;d be good if you&#39;re just getting quick drinks and snacks.<br><br>However, I&#39;d highly recommend against coming here for a full meal.<br><br>Beyond the totally &#39;meh&#39; food itself, the service was the worst I&#39;ve had in my six years of living in Brooklyn. There didn&#39;t seem to be any logic or order in which the tables were served--we were served a full (and unbelievable) two hours and ten minutes after we arrived at the restaurant. We watched countless patrons who arrived after us receive their food first. The waitress who was helping us was helpful and efficient, but it seems like there are huge issues with the kitchen and management. There are great ways to linger over a meal, but not as a casual, not-particularly-atmospheric place like this one. We weren&#39;t able to eat and leave the restaurant until a full three hours after we arrived.	0
Clam Linguini in white sauce was 4 star. Hubby had three soups.  (Yup, he did. What happens in Vegas...) Clam chowder was pretty good as was Spicy Seafood Stew, but by far, the Lobster Bisque was to die for...highly recommend 5 star!	1
This is by far the worst Chicken I have ever had in my entire life.. The Restaurant: Bad service, waiter didn't know about anything on the menu, it took (45 minutes for our "food" to come out to the table)The Food: I can't believe this place has the balls to use aChicken as a logo...Wtf. The "Chicken" I got was black.. Not white, not dark, black. Deep fried, slimy, and in no way Chicken. If you want to eat RatShit that had been breaded and deep fried come here!! Side note, I complained to the manager and she acted like she didn't know how to speak English.. I called when I got home to complain again and she hung up on me.	0
Good Chinese food	1
I love this place. It just feels like home. The spicy smells, the service, and they make some of the best spinach pies, meat pies, chicken pies, zahtar, deli sandwiches, hot lunches ... I could go on and on but if you enjoy authentic middle eastern food, you will love this place too!	1
Our server was slow. We had to flag someone down to get our drinks refilled twice. My nachos came out cold. We flew in from Dallas Texas to Vegas for my wedding anniverary and wanted some Mexican food, but the service was poor.	1
The waitress we had at this place seemed completely disinterested in giving us quality us good customer service. She took her sweet time to come and get our orders. Once we placed the order, it took forever for the food to come to the table, and once it did, it was cold, bland and just plain. Nothing great about La Carreta at International Mall. I will not be going back.	0
Truffle Fries are a MUST! Bartenders are cool. Bartender Joel is quite attractive.	1
I really hate wait, it is a bad beginning, and then the food, small portions, expensive, nothing special<br> We have to wait almost one hour even with reservation. So expensive for the food, was OK, nothing especial. The porcion was very tiny... considering the prices. Finally when we went we have to wait almost 20 minutes the car.<br>.	0
Being from Philly, I was excited but skeptical about Whiz. This place turned out to be awesome although the hoagie was definitely not authentic. <br><br>We ordered the whiz wit, which is a chopped steak with homemade cheese whiz and grilled onions. It was very tasty and definitely satisfied my homesick cravings. We also got the whiz fries and they were also freakin awesome. <br><br>We got the Italian stallion which looked like a normal Italian hoagie (I admit I did not read the description). The hoagie has mayo on it which is a huge no-no for me (although my mom would approve). I also realized halfway through it has EXTRA CRISPY PORK ROLL on it. Which is not normal. But it tasted great and made me so happy (I love pork roll and it&#39;s impossible to find out here). <br><br>I shared all of this with my husband and we were thoroughly full when finished our meal. I would highly recommend. Better than Boos IMHO - Boos has made me sick every time I have eaten it.	1
So overrated! This place did not live up the expectation the Yelp people raved about. The service was bad and everything was fried and doused in a heavy sauce. This place made me really dislike Chinese food. Not much more to say.	0
What can I say? They treat me like family and bring a new meaning to the word friendly. Everything on the menu is delicious, and the Berry Wonderful French Toast is to die for! None of that packaged toast in egg shit. This is the real thing, only better. It is one of my life goals to have that dish named after me.They serve breakfast all day, and the prices are oh so decent. Just don't go on weekends from breakfast to lunch, especially on Sundays, unless you don't mind waiting for over an hour to be seated. However, I'm not going to lie; I've definitely waited for over an hour during a toast craving because it is just. that. good.Sure the place is a little small and the tables are cozy (close together), but it's a fun, friendly environment... unless you are the princess from The Princess and the Pea. Of course, then nothing will satisfy you, will it?Park on the street (metered parking), or park on 1st street (parallel to 3rd) for free. There is usually ample parking on 1st; just be careful about street sweeping hours. Perpendicular streets are by permit only.	1
A micro-brewery with absolutely delicious food! This place was an absolute must-stop restaurant whenever my parents came to visit me in Madison, and I still go nearly every time I'm back in town. My favorites include the Wingra wings with Asian BBQ sauce, the Great Dane burger with creamy, garlicky spinach-artichoke sauce, and my absolute favorite - Thai chicken salad that comes with homemade brown beer bread. The best drink to wash this all down is the light Crop Circle Wheat beer, served with lemon. Yum, yum, yum!! If the weather's nice, enjoy your food outdoors in the ivy-walled patio/beer garden with cute black metal tables, or indoors upstairs in the spacious wooden booths if it's getting chillier outside, or if you're bar-hopping, check out the downstairs billiards bar with views of the micro-brewery at work. The Halloween Haunted House was also a fun time. ;) Gotta hit this place up if you're in town!	1
The food here was just alright. Pastas were overpriced for the quality. The veggies were small and not hot. Polenta was pretty good. Wouldn&#39;t come back nothing to write home about. Overall many more places for the price which have much better food.	0
We walked here after the Wurstkuche and i just ordered a Stone Porter that they had on tap. The beer was great.<br><br>The reason why i gave this a four stars because i would love to come back, the food looked really good and i saw some tables next to us and there food looked good as well. <br><br>This would be a good place to go if you are going to daikokuya since this is four doors down. You can put your name on there list and then walk over here to have some drinks, looks like they had a nice full bar.<br><br>Looks like i will be coming back	1
Usually I'm not the person to complain about restaurants, but this restaurant is the only restaurant that I think have the worse customer service in the UW area. I actually made a YELP account today to tell you how bad they are at treating their customers. Yesterday, my girlfriend and I walked into the restaurant, and BOTH the guy and the girl waiters saw us and they did not tell us to take a seat so we had to sit down by ourself. This is literally not a joke, we were sitting there for 20 straights up minutes before they give us a menu to order and water. Aren't restaurant suppose to give their customers water when they get to their seats? They didn't comeback to take our orders for another 15 minutes and that was the most irritating thing ever because the guy waiter (who look Japanese and wear the apron or some shit) was rather flirting with girls at the other tables and refill their water. He saw our empty glass of water, but he just ignored us and walked back to the bar area. At this time, I saw another Asian girl who sat down by herself at the table in the middle, and she was literally trying to get the waiters attention to get her menu and orders. I saw her waiving her hand back and forth for 20 minutes to get their attention but the waiters just kept walking past her. I literally finish eating my food, and still see that she haven't received her food yet. I was so upset that I wanted to cussed them out. How can the owners hired people like this? Treating customers like they are non-existent is the worse shit a restaurant can do. If you are people who who understand what the meaning of respect is, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND you not to come to this shit ass place. I ate all kind of restaurants in the Seattle area, and this have got to be the worse customer service place I have come across. We don't need to eat at place that don't see customers as human being. I hope they close down, I really do.	1
Amazing event the room is great and the food was stellar. I am looking forward to joining Mina&#39;s team for full dinner service soon. I can say that Bardot is going to be one of these great restaurants that many locals will drive down to the strip for. <br><br>Great job on the remodel and congrats to the Mina team.	1
This is quickly becoming one of my favorite restaurants. Everything my friends and I have had there have been really good. The first time I ate there I had the white pizza (highly recommended) and my friends had the chicken and waffles, which they raved about. I got the chicken and waffles the next time and I have to say it was some of the best chicken I&#39;ve had. The waffles were actually a little dry though. I&#39;ve also tried the margherita pizza, which was awesome. Hard to choose a favorite between the margherita and the white pizza. The truffle fries were so-so. They are cut a little thicker than I prefer, so are not as crispy. I&#39;ve had great luck with this place so far so will definitely be back!	1
Great location, beautiful coffees, gluten free treats should all make for a good thing. Unfortunately, Precita Park Cafe is run by a group of hip-looking, dead-eyed, super lethargic possible vegetarians who definitely do not know the difference between a mocha and a macchiato and wouldn't know decent service if it burned them on the finger. In fact, Precita Park Cafe is a phenomenal example of everything that's wrong with San Francisco today: oozing entitled condescension, apathy, cultish staff t-shirts. Most patrons, you will observe, have either a dog or a macbook or both (necessary distraction from the evil lurking under each gum-stuck, uncleaned table, perhaps) and (this is important) do not try calling in anything for pickup - they will answer the phone, take your order and then pretend they never got a call. I wish this place would close, or get taken over by a Starbucks or whatever buyout might most pain the current owners. I wish I could give this place zero or a negative number of stars for taking one of the cutest corner cafes in the whole city and turning into a meeting place for indifferent and unsmiling yuppie shitbags. Mostly though, I wish one barista, any barista there, would somehow learn the tiniest bit of politeness and/or decency, wipe that pathetic indifferent look off their faces while they're talking to me and fucking crack a smile.	0
Had dinner with a group of 10 people on Wednesday. Food poisoning the next morning. Horrible experience. Their salad bar wasn&#39;t anything special. Texas de Brazil is definitely my to go for brazillian steakhouse! Two stars for great service!	0
For all you Triple D Fan&#39;s don&#39;t bring your kids. I went here to try another spot on the Triple D list and I&#39;m starting to doubt Guy&#39;s taste bud&#39;s, he is 50/50 so far in my book. Drove into town looking to try a good eating spot. Went here with family and got a big surprise once we got there. It&#39;s a bar/lounge nothing for the Fam. Being from the Windy City I know good pizza. I felt like we ordered a hot n ready from Little Caesar&#39;s. It wasn&#39;t nasty but it will not get any recommendations from me.<br><br>When I got there it was a guy out front drinking a beer, he said he owned two tattoo shops, and he was pumping the place up saying, everything was good. Hahaha it amazes me how different people taste&#39;s are telling them something is good versus what is really good. I&#39;m totally convinced that if there were a taste test to prove that some foods are not as good as others, I think a lot of people would like the crap food over the good flavorful foods.<br><br> I also ordered the wings with all the sauces I like my sauce on the side so I can actually taste the wings and my wings were dry and brittle. The sauces were typical. I get better wings at Buffalo Wild Wings and sauces to. <br><br>The fries were rubbery and soft nothing to brag about, I was really disappointed with my order, but I&#39;m sure it&#39;s hit or miss when you do take out, but nothing can save that pizza flavor, it doesn&#39;t matter if the pizza is cold or hot when it&#39;s good it&#39;s good, and this pizza needs some more flavor added to it. <br><br>Other posts on here mentioned the staff and I had a little blond help me with my order and she was making me feel like I was asking for to much when I asked for more Ketchup. She wasn&#39;t pleasant at all. Oh and speaking of the ketchup. I heard they make their own, they should stick to buying it from the market. Not at all impressed with the watered down taste. <br><br>I may try this place some other time to see if it will be better dinning in. But for now based on the amateur Pizza, dry ass wings and lack luster fries this place is getting Two Stars.	0
Ok deli....cute location. &nbsp;Food was ok...	0
I enjoyed the food both times going here but the last time coming I noticed in the back where the food was being prepared, a sack of generic brand brown sugar. Of course being raw &amp; vegan doesn&#39;t rule out brown sugar..but it&#39;s certainly not organic. And I guarantee you that the niche being served here is not going to be fond of that ingredient. I believe with all my heart and soul that eating raw and vegan is the most healthful thing you can do for your body but what is the point if you combine it with chemically laden, super processed ingredients? It just makes me question the values of this place. I&#39;m grateful that this place exists but please, just use some coconut sugar and show people that eating this way tastes good! We don&#39;t need the sugar.	0
Flavourful sandwiches and nice atmosphere. Very functional - communal tables, self-serve drinks. The ice teas were really good. A bit of a hipster vibe.	1
The menu is huge with tons of options and the food is very good.	1
I heard a lot of reviews on Umami Burger, and as a carnivore myself, I was excited to try it. I came here for lunch with my friend. It took us awhile to find the restaurant, but it's located inside the same area as Urban Outfitters.It was our first time here, and we decided to get two different meals since it came with alcoholic drinks, which was a plus!My friend got the Umami burger while I got the Port & Stilton burger. I was surprised the blue cheese did not overpower the meat. The port-caramelized onions were perfect with the blue cheese and the meat. The burger was satisfying! I only took a bite of the Umami burger, and it was appetizing. I have yet to sample it.We also got a side of fries and potato fries. The potato fries were not that special compare to other places, but the dipping sauce was good! I think the waitress told us it was specially made or something, but I'm not entirely sure. It was tasty though! Overall, the meal was satisfying.The only problem for me was the price. A burger can cost over $10, and honestly, the burger was not worth $10 since the portions were not that big. I don't see myself coming back here again unless someone pays for me. BUT if you are willing to pay $10+ for a burger and you're in the LA area, I think you should give Umami a try.	1
The BEST falafel I have ever had. YUMMMMM. as mentioned in other reviews- perfectly crunchy on the outside and creamy and amazing on the inside.	1
I just want to add after a series of bad meals and a bad call on the hostess/waiters part we will not go back to this place.	0
Decent food, nice cozy space. A bit overpriced with small portions.	0
Even though it received a &#34;C&#34; rating from NYC&#39;s Restaurant Health Department Inspection, we went anyway because of the rave reviews and the fact that it was consistently packed (even though it is quite small) lent some assurance. <br><br>Food was great - ordered beef skewers, mushroom skewers, tuna tartar, french fries, and steak cubes. <br><br>Unfortunately an hour later, my bf and I succumbed to food poisoning. It&#39;s been five hours and we&#39;re still running off to the bathroom!	0
Still undecided on this fixture of the Embarcadero. It's location is superb, offering scenic views and great people watching . It's food and its sometimes mediocre quality, however, is not enough to have you disregard its tired state of decor. Perhaps, though, that is what adds to its allure? Also, an appearance on Guy Fieri's Triple D, doesn't hurt either. Good times, not great food, have been had here, especially when the Japanese Navy was on scene to celebrate Cinco De Mayo. After all these years, I'm still trying to figure you out Pier 23.	0
FANTASTIC BURGERS!My husband and I like to think of ourselves as Burger aficionados. We've sampled many gourmet burgers around the city with all the bells and whistles...however we always come back to the Bowery. The english muffin provides the best canvas for the tasty patty + toppings to truly make a meat-splotion in your mouth. Order "the works" with bleu cheese, red onion confit and bacon! The salty bleu cheese is a great contrast to the jammy-onions. Don't forget to order a the macaroni au gratin. It has a great creamy, almost thanksgiving type of feel (I think it has nutmeg in it).	1
Let me start by saying that the food is on point and it's a beautiful location, however that's where the good stops. The drinks are laughable!! The have a Negroni that's not a Negroni, an Old Fashioned that isn't an Old Fashioned and the worst Moscow Mule I've ever had. Then there was the service... The bartender was so distant and aloof, barley paying us any attention. We clearly didn't like our drinks, as we didn't drink them. I don't want anything for free, however a "how is everything?" Or "can I get you something else?" would have been nice. I can't remember her name, but she was a very unpleasant Asian girl. I'm sad to say that we won't be returning, I can go somewhere else and be treated poorly and be charged a lot... Best of luck Playa Provisions.	0
Pastrami sandwich: piled high with lean, tasty, pastrami on very good rye bread. Good selection of spicy mustardsStuffed cabbage entree: sweet and sour. enormous portion. Hot and juicy. Potato knish: not quite like I used to get in Coney Island but awfully close and just excellent.Potato pancakes: spiced just right and fried to a crisp.Corn rye bread from the bakery: the best I've eaten in years.Cherry phosphate for me: I'm 14 again. Guiness for my wife: there are Jews in Ireland, you know. And there are Irish Americans eating pastrami sandwiches in Canter's who like Guiness with their meal.I don't think I've enjoyed a meal this much in a long time. 75% good comfort food, 25% nostalgia for my teen years.	1
Had a rough day cruised past Ohana where the atmosphere is warm and friendly everyday. The Happy Hour is a great deal - food for $3 and great portions. Stayed in my budget and left a happy man.	1
I was SO disappointed by this place!<br><br>I came here on a Saturday night and it was full but not packed. However, there were only 2 servers working which resulted in a really slow service. And we were hungry. It seemed like the servers alternated working the emptyish bar and actually serving. Anyway...<br><br>My friend and I ordered the garlic knots and two pizzas and ended up with leftovers. <br><br>Garlic knots: fine, but not spectacular. They had a garlic filling inside that wasn&#39;t particularly flavorful. $6 for 5 mediocre knots? Pass.<br><br>Sunburn pizza with burrata: this one was better than the veggie lover, but it was pretty mediocre overall. neither the flavors nor the dough were particularly spectacular, and I&#39;ve seriously had better pizza at chain restaurants. <br><br>Veggie lover with garlic: sadly bland. A slab of mediocre dough with some veggies thrown on top. I guess they forgot the spices?<br><br>Our meal wasn&#39;t expensive which was nice but the bad service and the equally bad food means I won&#39;t return ever.	0
We came here on 07/30/2013 and this place is gone, done, out of business and CLOSED!!!...the sign is still there, but the place is Dead.	0
We went there on a Sunday morning and the line was already long before 8 	1
I really like LA cafe. They have by far the best food that you'll order at 3am. It's really a hub for people to go to after a night out, the scene is fun and the food is good quality. I'm a vegan so I appreciate their healthy vegan options they have. Kosmic Krunchy salad is one of the best salads I've had in Downtown at ANY time of day. Last night my order got lost in the crowd which sometimes happens at busy restaurants. They checked on me, realized their mistake, and quickly fixed my order and added in 3 GIANT cookies for my troubles. I appreciate small gestures like that and it shows they really care about their customers. 5 stars :)	1
I really love the "old feel" atmosphere here. Cash only. Menu on the sides of the restaurant. The service was so so. I wished our server was a bit more friendly and more conversing.The food here is absolutely FANTASTIC. Plus you really feel like you are in 1924. Must come here!!!	1
My husband and I came for dinner on a Saturday night and it was delicious! It was packed, but they took our name down and we were seated within 10 minutes. They have a variety of empanadas to choose from; we had the chorizo and it was amazing. Not your usual ground chorizo you would get from a Cuban bakery, a real piece of Argentinian chorizo broken up into pieces wrapped in a crispy dough...yum! Our dinner was the vacio with 2 sides and the steak was perfectly cooked. Hopefully it keeps it&#39;s flair and service. Next stop...breakfast, hopefully it&#39;s as good as dinner.	1
Took my girlfriend here. We absolutely loved everything that we tried. Beef stroganoff was amazing. Borsch soup was very good. So was the olivier salad. Would recommend to anyone that will listen...	1
I can' stop going back to this place. Hands down the best food in seattle. Everything they have tastes good. Service is awesome. If you end up trying this place, don't forget to order their rabbit dish. AMAZING!!	0
Generally have enjoyed our meals at Olea which means everyone else has too, so they&#39;ve become too busy for a last minute meal. Unfortunately they aren&#39;t worth the long wait, and the last time we went charged us extra for seconds on endive leaf to use as a dip which we had substituted for bread with the dips. Come on people, how much is endive leaf!	0
canters is my secret favorite happy hour spot!! not so much canters, as the kibitz room in the back. the bartenders are super nice and attentive and give you tasty chips and salsa as soon as you sit down. the drinks are strong and the shots are huge! also they have happy hour food that's super delicious as well.	1
Try their famous fried chicken. It's very crunch and the chicken is tender. Of course, you always need to have Hite beer with the fried chicken.Valet parking is $2	1
I make it a point to stop at Canter's each time I visit LA. An LA institution. From an out-of-towner's perspective Canter's is a much needed oasis as one crosses the desert Los Angeles sprawl.TIP: As you enter the restaurant look into the glass cases on your left for a display of desserts. It will help you navigate the menu later.Worth the stop and a return visit.	1
For those of you who complain Madison is bereft of Mexican food, I instruct you to check out El Pastor. It's amazing authentic food where you will probably have to know at least minimal Spanish in order to interact with your server. Get away from downtown, and go here.	0
Great food and service! We brought in a group of 21 and the staff was very accommodating. The food was great and very well priced. Thank you!	1
I hear about this good things about this place. Some Los Angelenos I&#39;ve met say their pastrami is comparable to Katz&#39;s Deli in NYC. &#34;Really?&#34; I would say. I&#39;ve been to Katz&#39;s and it rocks! Let&#39;s try this place out with Sarah one late night.<br><br>Parking sucks of course, you gotta find street parking. But the place is big, you can choose the loud section with live music or the quiet side. I just wanted to eat in peace that night. We got seated fairly quickly at a booth.<br><br>The place looks old school, of course since it&#39;s been a landmark here forever. The menu selection is vast like in most Jewish delicatessens.<br><br>I ordered the Bronx Special and a Chocolate Egg Cream.<br><br>I like liver, so the Bronx Special was right up my alley. The finely chopped liver was pate-like. Thick slices of pastrami stack in between. It was full of great flavor. It came with a potato salad or cole slaw on the side. Very filling plate of food. The egg cream was sweet and delicious if you like egg creams in general.<br><br>The bathroom upstairs is quite a walk, it&#39;s like walking through an exhibit at a museum.<br><br>Overall the food was great and being open 24 hours is convenient for night owls. But it&#39;s not quite Katz&#39;s Deli quality, that&#39;s tough to beat.	1
Was not good. <br><br>3 of us went into some pretty nice decor and restaurant set up. I was impressed by the restaurant decor and loved the wallpaper. We ordered the Old School hot pot, the kimchi fried rice with 2 extra eggs, white kimchi banchan and the napa kimchi banchan.<br><br>The banchan first of all was way over pickled. Everything tasted so extremely vinegary, that our taste buds felt like they melted off. The white kimchi tastes like mignonette for oysters. It had a weird grainy texture and i think this was due to grind-ed radishes. This is normally a very refreshing banchan, but, I did not find it refreshing at all. The only good banchan for me was the chives.<br><br>Nothing tasted Korean so far, just very few Korean ingredients. We had the kimchi fried rice with 4 eggs on top. That was decent, bland in seasoning though. The eggs saved the day. <br><br>then came the Old School hot pot, it does not taste or smell like what it looks like. Had a lot of herbs that don&#39;t go well with Korean food in my opinion. Maybe, Korean flavored food is not Choi&#39;s objective, if that&#39;s the case, it worked. The food looked really delicious and savory. The food tastes like Thai food. Everything was soaked in sesame oil or some other kind of oil and i actually felt a bit sick from it later. <br><br>I am disappointed. Not returning.	0
Food: I like to come by here with some friends when I have a ramen craving. I highly recommend the butter and corn! It sounded like a really weird combo to me but it actually went really well in the soup! The happy hour for appetizers are pretty good too!Service: Usually service is okay, but my last one was a big turn off. We gave our friend money and she paid on her card so it wouldnt be confusing for the server. We included tip so our friend was going to add the tip on her card too. She forgot to add our tip on her card and the waitress literally stopped us at the door and asked "only 1 dollar for 4 people?!" Honestly I worked in the food industry and I understand we should tip, but c'mon its still your job. When you stop customers at the door that's a huge problem. Maybe we just didnt like how you were as a waitress..	0
I've been going here a lot(pretty much a regular you could say.) It's a good place to include in your bar hopping plans. Wandos too busy? Fooseball taken at Vintage? Swing by Red Shed. It's also one of the few bars you can actually have a conversation at some nights. One of my minor complaints is the jukebox. If there is no songs playing..it's just that--quiet. And at certain points in the night, you can hear a pin drop. Lines for the bathroom is sometimes annoying and I've felt really bad for the ladies here who have sometimes waited 30 minutes before the line moved one person :P	0
Before I was vegan, I ate here a lot. Had I been a Yelper then, I would review it just the same! But yes, I am vegan and I according to the cashier their whole wheat patties in the vegetable, callaloo and tofu variety are vegan! Unfortunately there weren&#39;t any tofu ones available when I went today but I had a vegetable and callaloo one and can you say FLAVOR EXPLOSIONNN! Would be a five-star review if they had more of a selection veggie/Ital-friendly food.	1
Best meat sandwich (chivito) in town! Great food and service for a very low price, perfect combination!	1
A bit pricey but the dineoutboston special menu came with much larger portions than we had imagined.  We were over stuffed.  We will Try the lunch menu which looks like a good deal price wise.  Food was great.	1
This place still has the best banana cream pie. It&#39;s heaveeeeen in your mouth. I crave their pie all the time. Every time I visit LA, I make a stop here. I also highly recommend the pecan pie with vanilla ice cream. Pass on the apple pie.<br><br>The other food is eh (e.g. burgers, fries).	1
Go here when the weather is nice - it has a great patio overlooking Pike Place, the Sound, and the Olympics beyond. The atmosphere is great, and if there's a band playing in the bar, you can count on it being a great one (when I was there, it was a jazz trio). I had the lasagna which was really good - I'd probably order it again in the future. Afterwards, head over the the White Horse Trading Company for a beer - it's practically next door.	1
It may seem like a lot for a sandwich but its worth it. They are super flavorful! I love this place. We love getting their sandwiches and watching football at home. Try the Joker.	1
i&#39;m sorry. i didn&#39;t like it. did i go in expecting too much? perchance- i mean, husband convinced me AGAINST going to ramen champ to go here instead and while i didn&#39;t really mind so much, i was upset on behalf of my out of town guests who had only two requests: good boba and RAMEN CHAMP. instead we came here to manichi with their glowing reviews only to look down into a bowl of al dente noodles and some spots of color atop our broth. the black one i assumed to be the black garlic oil but actually tasted of burnt oil, the red one was tastier with chunks of ground meat but was also alas, oil. i made the mistake of trying each &#39;spot&#39; individually but sadly, it simply coated my lips with a film of grease. it tasted better after i mixed everything in but that SMOKY/BURNT taste! it would not leave my mouth :( i felt it ruined my entire ramen experience, and made me long sadly for my usual: men oh :/ i will likely not be back. <br><br>on a more favorable note: their gyoza was delicious.	0
Pizza is very good. love the thin crust. being from ny i feel like no pizza in miami is good , but i liked theirs....AS for the service. myself and three friends went there to meet 5 other friends .. We told the host/waiter we were going to wAit fir 5 more people and well just get a beer while waiting, well well host was so rude said we couldent sit and wait n just order beer we had to order food or just stand and wait. And he was obnoxious , like cmon were going to have an 8 person dinner we can&#39;t sit and wait fir the other people on our group? Well whatever we walked accross the street and had a drink at the bar were the server told us we can order andiamo and bring it there and eat it which is cool ;)	0
i had HB on my &#34;to do&#34; list for at least two years now &amp; finally went for my birthday, only to be sorely disappointed. <br><br>the meal went something like this (party of two on a thursday night):<br>- waitress ignored us for the first 10 minutes<br>- raved-about almond stuffed dates were... mediocre. small. barely warm. &#34;meh, i&#39;ve experienced better&#34; is right<br>- i ordered the lamb meatballs. taste was good, but dish was lukewarm to cold; waitress did not check on us for at least 15 minutes after we had received meal<br>- asked to have the meatballs warmed up. waitress does not ask why i asked to heat it up; does not apologize at any point in the meal; does not even ask how we are doing or if we like our food<br>- mussels &amp; fries were good<br>- the waitress &amp; bus boy fight over the thermostat the entire meal. one would turn it up. 30 seconds later the other would turn it down. this went back &amp; forth at least 15 times. we were seated next to a vent, which kept blowing cold drafts on us every time someone changed the thermostat<br><br>food tasted good, but the cold dish, awkward experience &amp; bad service has moved HB to my &#34;miss this&#34; list.	0
AMAZING!!! Great price for an awesome pizza! You get an 11 pizza with whatever you want for $6.88. We are talking best deal in Seattle (in my option of course).	1
Went here last Saturday for breakfast with my wife. Ordered breakfast like everyone else there, then realized 20 MINUTES LATER that all of the tables around us, including the one with four people who ordered 10 minutes after us, all had their food. To top it off, we didn&#39;t see our waitress during this entire time we waited. I asked the manager for a bit of help. He quickly said he would check on it, came back to let us know the food would be out soon. He was very smug, not friendly at all. Finally, our food was brought out a few minutes later. The waitress showed up, asked us how things were and offered an apology, while letting us know that the person who was supposed to cover our table never did. While it was nice of the waitress to offer her apology, not once did the manager offer an apology or even act like he cared. At the end, we received a few dollars off our bill (I believe they took off the orange juices we ordered), but no apology from the manager. <br><br>The one star is for the food because it was good, but I ate it really fast so I could rush out of there as I no longer cared to be sitting there any longer. My experience at BLD ruined my morning, made me decide to NEVER go there again and ultimately prompted me to write this review. <br><br>Management - please, at the very least, train your managers to apologize and remedy a bad situation as quickly as possible. A smug attitude is preventing BLD from ever seeing another dollar out of my pocket.	0
Soo good. Came here unexpectedly. Caught happy hour. Loved everything. The debris sandwich = amazing. Chowder = amazing. All our drink were great too. I'm gushing. Cuz I'm still high from the goodness here.	0
Terrible experience!! I would NEVER come back.<br>1. worst service in NYC<br>2. Kitchen is inefficient<br>3. Burger: asked medium, came well done<br>4. Fries: came uncooked <br>5. Waiting: forever<br><br>Usually I dont write reviews but this one worths the time.. Got there and was told the wait was about 40min. For my surprise there was EIGHT tables available. When I asked why they were not sitting people, I was told the kitchen couldnt take more orders so they couldn&#39;t take people to the tables.. What??? It doesnt make sense at all.. Better leave people waiting standing? Elder, kids..<br>When we finally sat, the food took a long time to come, we asked if the fries could come before and the answer was negative. When we got the food, burger which was supposed to be medium was well done and the fries were uncooked. This place have the worst operations system I have ever seen. The basics would haver a bigger and more efficient kitchen and reduce the space for tables. What is the point of having a huge salon if the kitchen cant serve all those tables. Poor managing, poor service, poor food. Would give ZERO STARS with I had the choice	0
Came here twice for a birthday and going away party. Good places to have a party if you put in reservations. Place doesn&#39;t get too crowded. The best drink here I think is called the Atlantic.	1
Just tried it for the first time, and I&#39;ll definitely be back soon! I had the catfish sandwich. The catfish was beautifully fried, the slaw and the remoulade nicely complemented the fish, and the bread was firm enough to hold the sandwich together but easy enough to bite through that I didn&#39;t have the catfish to get a bite. They really know what they&#39;re doing!	1
Alright alright where do I even begin?First, if you're expecting it to be anything like Don Felix DONT COME HERE! It's really good, great in fact but it's more Americanized than anything. I have no complains about anything it's just not what I expected. I decided to write a review because I was expecting the same type of food like Don Felix but it didn't come close. If you're into Peruvian food try it out but just remember to keep an open mind about it.	1
I grew up right down the street from Cliff's Edge and can't believe I never realized it was there! It's sort of nestled behind the 99c store, and easy to miss if you aren't looking for it. Ambiance = 5 stars Food = somewhere between 2 1/2 to 3 stars Cliff's Edge is the sweetest, cutest little restaurant with an endearing patio constructed around a large, charmingly old tree. Candles, lanterns, heaters, rustic mirrors and wordly cushions adorn the deck and surround the tables (which are a tad close together if you are weird about that sort of thing). The service is pretty outstanding. The hostess was so charming and friendly, and our waitress was super cool! Overall it was really pleasant experience at Cliff's Edge, and the scenery and vibe of the restaurant is worth it to try at least once. I will say, however, that the food was not all that impressive. It seems the norm for expensive, trendy places to serve underwhelming, upscale dishes. It is pretty pricey for dinner and so you would expect the caliber of food to be on par with a 4 star restaurant of similar pricing. At Cliff's Edge, you are really paying for the ambiance. I had a pleasant experience here, but for the price, I might not come back unless it's just to drink a couple bottles of wine by the lovely tree.	1
Theo chocolates is hidden on a back street in Fremont. Pass behind the unassuming facade and you will find yourself in a chocolate boudoir with a wide range of bars caramels and ganaches to buy.	1
Not worth your time To much hype, not worth the price it&#39;s going for. Honestly you can get this at any mcdonalds. I would rather go to umami burger and if you want eggs with your burgers and that to me is over hyped as well.	0
We had to wait 45 minutes between our appetizers and entrees. We ordered two rare steaks and tuna tartar. Steak came out well done, so we had to wait another 15 minutes for new ones to come out. We had to ask three times to speak with a manager about the slow service. He agreed to take a bottle of wine and a cocktail off our bill. When the bill came nothing had been taken off, so we had to ask for him again. Finally, we asked to have our steaks wrapped up, by this time we were not very hungry because it had been over two hours since we sat down. When we got home, we discovered they had only wrapped up some French fries we had never ordered. <br><br>I won&#39;t be going back; charging the outrageous prices they do for steaks that take 1 hour to make and are cooked incorrectly is pathetic.	0
I was on vacation and came here because of yelp. I have to say, this place feels like a tourist trap being on Michigan Ave. We waited 30 minutes even though there were few tables available for two. It was unoccupied for the duration of the whole time while we were waiting. Finally being seated in one of them after 30 minutes. <br><br>The food here can be summed up with one word: SALTY. everything I ordered feels like i am eating the same dish since salt is the only thing that I can taste. being Chinese, I have eaten a lot of salty food, however, this is far too salty then to my acceptable tolerance. <br><br>It is pretty bad when the pig ear I ordered came out to be a bunch of fried crumbs tasting like the oil that it was bathed in.	0
Scofflaw has been my neighborhood watering hole of choice for the past 2 years. From where I live in Humboldt Park, there is no other bar within walking distance where I can get great food and exquisitely-crafted, strong cocktails for only $8. It&#39;s got [what I consider] the perfect atmosphere for a bar: low lighting, candles, chandeliers, baroque couches and Motown. I&#39;d recommend a drink, but it&#39;s hard to go wrong anywhere on their specialty gin-based, hand-illustrated cocktail menu -- also because they change it up at least once a month, so I&#39;ve taken to photographing it whenever I visit to keep track of what I&#39;ve tried. I have brought friends and parents from out of town to Scofflaw, and they&#39;ve all had a great time. Even if you&#39;re not down for dinner &amp; just want to drink, you HAVE to try their fries with pimenton aioli! Sometimes, if you stay till almost-closing, they&#39;ll break out complimentary fresh-baked cookies. One time, I saw Rahm Emanuel hanging out in a booth.<br><br>Only reason I&#39;m docking a point: other reviewers are correct, there is a dearth of seating which leads to much vulture-swarming around parties who look about to leave. Though their plates are relatively small, the tiny tables make it hard to eat comfortably, especially when you&#39;re rolling with a group. Scofflaw was well-known in the hood before it was in the Reader&#39;s Best Of, but now the cat&#39;s out of the bag all across town, making it even harder to squeeze your way into a spot. The only remedy for this is to arrive before 7 PM, ideally on a weekday. Oops, maybe I shouldn&#39;t have told you. Dibs!<br><br>Regardless, I&#39;m in love and will always come back!	1
Came here with a bunch of friends for Sunday brunch. I had to ask several times and waited quite a while for my OJ. Ordered the pancakes and they were overcooked and dry and the blueberries were pathetically wilted and had something green among them (mint maybe? not sure). Bench table was also not comfortable.<br><br>Just not impressed in any way.	0
Great tacos! I love this place, they have great food. I won&#39;t get tacos from any where else! Skip the truck and eat great food!<br>I&#39;m a massive fan!!!!	1
Yay! I had a much better experience today and me and my friend were very happy. I was accommodated by a young man and woman and they were attentive with our orders. Kitchen staff were friendly and the pizza oven, which was set on 540 degrees, popped out non-burnt crust. +1 from previous check ins ;-) <br><br>I ordered red sauce, Parmesan, and all veggies (including corn- they have corn now!!). And my friend ordered red sauce, all veggies, sausage and pepperoni. <br>Pizzas came out beautifully cooked and I enjoyed every luscious bite of my pizza. I must say, either I picked the right ingredients which fits my hunger or they put TLC on their toppings because the pizza tasted better than expected. Also better than my past previous check-ins :-)<br><br><br>I&#39;ll be coming back often; very satisfied with the improvements.	1
Simply the best Chinese restaurant in Miami! <br>Don&#39;t let it&#39;s appearance deceive you, they decor might not be the fanciest one, but the food is fantastic. <br>Prices are also very reasonable. <br>We have tried different dishes here, ingredients seem always fresh... but mainly we keep coming back for the hot pot/ fire pot, I haven&#39;t heard of another place that offers this dish. <br>The people who own the place are really nice and they would advise you if you feel adventurous enough to try something new. <br>Highly recommend this place!	1
This is the worst service I've ever gotten in my entire life. The staff here is terrible and so rude. I will never ever come back here and I will make sure no one else comes here that I know. I am furious after I came in here. I will never be back!	0
Not a bad place. they Don&#39;t have any vegan options..I think any restaurant should have at least one dish that is vegan or vegetarian. We went there cauz it was a new spot and we wanted to check it out. Decor is really nice but we looked at the menu and the dishes had meat. I requested to make me a veggie pad thai and it was delish. I like the place but Don&#39;t know if I will be back since there Nothing for me to eat.	1
I was disappointed with the menu as it was very limited.  They didn't have any entrees with chicken.The service was good.  Appreciated that the waitress asked us if we wanted our entrees to be held a bit since we had appetizers and salads.  But she then didn't check in on us for drink refills for some time.I would recommend for drinks and appetizers not for dinner.	0
The food is by far some of the best in Baltimore &amp; Howard counties. Although the restaurant is a bit off the beaten path, it's well worth the journey. The kitchen does an amazing job of using fresh ingredients &amp; turning out food to make your palate sing. The cocktail list is innovative &amp; the wine list is never-ending. You can't beat this - it's a must eat &amp; drink spot!	0
when leaving for monterey at 4 in the morning we were wondering what to eat for breakfast and we decided on bagels. one small problem none of the bagel places in our area would be open, but by the time we got to LA their bagel places would. i don&#39;t know how we ended up at canters ordering deli at six in the morning, especially when we were talking about bagels but their brooklyn ave with swiss for breakfast was absolute killer. their brisket on rye at 6am to was super killer. <br><br>i was worried and thoughts were swirling, &#34;can the deli meats this early in the morning be any good?&#34; &#34;who eats deli this early&#34;, &#34;do they steam their deli meats for 24hr service?&#34; all this was answered as soon as we took our first bite. usually i&#39;m the one that will speak first after a bite but the wife just let out &#34;omg&#34;, &#34;this is the juiciest brisket ive had ever in canters&#34;, &#34;you&#39;ve got to try it&#34;. sure enough, it was. canters brisket is very good but you got to make sure its hot not warm, there&#39;s a huge difference when it is. looking at the sandwich i could see all the brisket juice just oozing out and every single bite needed a napkin dab. killer brisket! the brooklyn ave with swiss which i get once in awhile cause the wife thinks its sacrilegious was the perfect sandwich for the time of day cause the dressing and slaw cuts down the saltiness of the pastrami. there was a teeny tiny minor miss, the swiss could&#39;ve been melted a bit more, but all of it with the pastrami and the rye. hellooooo!<br><br>its kind of nice to experience canters this early where you sat yourself and all you can hear throughout is the chatter and bustle of workers.	1
Ten Mercer's salmon sandwich with killer shoestring potato fries is one of my favorite restaurant meals in the city.	1
best fritanga spot i know of. better than yambo	1
Came here before a play at the Pantages and it's fantastic. We both had breakfast burritos with chicken ad bottomless mimosas. It was all great! We loved the burrito which comes with an awesome potatoes and peppers mix. The mimosas were delicious and they kept them full. Highly recommend.	1
I&#39;m still drooling/dreaming about the braised short rib...if you eat beef get this dish! Started with the French Maid cocktail and ahi tuna tartare. For dinner we had braised short rib, salmon, and chicken. Everything was prepared very well. Definitely going back for dinner with great views and atmosphere.	1
This is probably the third time I entered this place completely inebriated and not remember a single thing I ate. But, I have to hand it to them, the Original Pantry Cafe serves their late night guests without complaints and with a smile. The Pantry is an older building hot spot, great from those late night munchies, and serves up that simple diner food. As one Yelper put it, &#34;you go for the history and ambiance, not for the food.&#34; <br><br>There&#39;s nothing truly special about their menu, but personally, for me, I got random memories here which makes it a good time for meals and good friends any time.	1
someone that took my order swore that they had seen me before when i had never clearly stepped into the restaurant. i ordered a veggie burger and i wasn't impressed at all, while the fries looked like they had been rolled in grease. going down to the bathroom was an experience and a half. i would eat here if it was the only thing open, seeing as its 24 hours. but if you have a choice, please do yourself a favor and go somewhere else.	0
I love this place! Great ambiance, great service and great food. You must order the wings! They are not fried, but baked. YUMMY! I&#39;ve never seen this place packed, but it is most likely due to their location and take-out/delivery services. They also know how to cook some tasty chicken, but I would not recommend the ribs or turkey burger. The latter is not the best in town. Still adore this hole-in-the-wall, though!	1
Apple Pan has earned its place on the list of LA&#39;s top burgers. Unfortunately, the deliciousness of its burger doesn&#39;t make up for the fact that there is just not enough seating in this place! Maybe that&#39;s what adds to the charm and the trendiness? I don&#39;t know.<br><br>What&#39;s for sure is that we will never get 10 seats at the same time for the Burger Club (<a href="/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.BurgerClubLA.com&amp;s=06d65dc8e03f6567654e2864b338c72f94d60361a45febccaf94e8b16afe8dd3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">BurgerClubLA.com</a>) to actually try this burger as a group, unless we go at like 3am on a tuesday (Are they even open then?). So instead, I ventured out to Apple Pan to try the burger myself with a buddy. IT WAS DELICIOUS. Easily a 4.5 on our scale in terms of taste. I highly recommend it.<br><br>Here comes the bad parts: The wait for two seats was over 20 minutes. You get deducted for that. It doesn&#39;t matter how old fashioned you want to be, you guys gotta figure out how to control demand. You&#39;re leaving money on the table here. Even more importantly, once I was seated, I felt like I was being pressured the whole time to eat my food as quickly as I could and get the heck out of the seat for the next guy. that&#39;s just not the vibe I want when scarfing down to beef.<br><br>Second, the place only takes cash. I know I know, it goes back to the charm and quaintness of the Apple Pan being so old fashioned... (or maybe it&#39;s because these guys aren&#39;t paying all their taxes and so only want to operate on a cash-basis)... regardless, you&#39;ve heard me say this before, it&#39;s 2010. In about 5 years, i don&#39;t expect anyone to be walking around with cash in their pocket. It doesn&#39;t make sense. Yes, there is an ATM right across the street, but that&#39;s even worse. Paying a $2 surcharge to get money out to pay for an $8 burger is ridiculous. Get with the program people.<br><br>So... my 4.5 drops to a 4 because of these issues. sorry Apple Pan, there are others around town that can provide a similarly delicious burger with much much less hassle.	1
The place is very nice from the outside and when we arrived we were eager to have equally good food. And so we decided to start with a fresh orange juice that was served halfway and a cappuccino ( also they only had whole milk... Which is not very versatile or smart given that so many people can&#39;t have lactose ) and then we ordered the charcuterie plate. It took the waitress about 25 minutes to bring something that requires no cooking whatsoever and the place was not full at all. <br><br>When the plate arrived she didn&#39;t even apologize and then the bread was stale, horrible as if it was old and had been reheated and there were TWO slices of Gouda cheese for a 25$ plate.... <br><br>Not to mention the salami was disgusting and the pickled vegetables seem of very low quality.<br><br>Would never go back and such a shame because they have a good location. The waitress was also very unhelpful and careless.	0
This is a story called A Wilted Piece of Lettuce	0
We came here for the first time for our 10th wedding anniversary.  The dining room was full so we were offered a private room upstairs. It was a great experience from the delicious food and steak to the fabulous service. We were certainly well taken care of.	1
This place is terrible. I honestly don&#39;t understand how it has such high ratings. In all honesty it&#39;s a 2.5 star restaurant, but I needed to give it a 1 star rating to try and balance out the disproportionately high rating it has right now. <br><br>The atmosphere is corky and uncomfortable... feels kind of like going to &#34;grandma&#39;s&#34; house with a lot of knick knacks lying around and uncomfortable seating. <br><br>The food was also very bland/ not much flavor.<br><br>The desert was decent, but also, nothing special.	0
Good and attentive service. Very cool and hip vibe. Great location. The three times I've eaten here I've been underwhelmed by the food, especially the two breakfasts.	0
This place has the best food for your money in the neighborhood by far. If you&#39;re willing to eat at a bar and eat off of metal plates and bowls, you will be rewarded with the best grub Bushwick has to offer. Definitely make sure to order the specials. Desserts are newer but totally stellar. Recommend sitting at the bar; table service can be somewhat inconsistent.	1
Came here with a friend last month after a movie session. I didn't have a high expectation considering the hipster-y area. We sat ourselves, the waiter promptly greeted us. He was friendly and helpful, we really liked him. I don't remember what my friend got (something I never had known to exist), but I got the Partridge Family. Phenomenal. The main reason I order it was because of the corn which I was disappointed in, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. The chicken though. Boneless. Cannot get better than that. The waffle was unexpected, maybe pumpkin spice? Or just cinnamon. No clue. The potatoes were so much better than I would have though considering it's a diner. Delicious! As was the gravy, which I think may have been unnecessary for this meal, then again I love syrup with my chicken when I can get it. As a whole, I really loved this joint and can't wait to come back!	1
Over priced, no Indian people -staff and guests- and long wait time. Wouldn&#39;t recommend coming here I anyone.	0
This place started out great. Would come here as much as possible. My boyfriend and I would always order the roast chk dinner for delivery. They have gone downhill lately and it&#39;s a shame. The chk has gotten worse every time I have ordered it over the last few months until I just stopped. Tastes like they just throw it together and don&#39;t take the time to season or fully cook, anymore. There are a couple of new people working the front with bad, combative attitudes (young hipstery dude is the worst) and I have found that I just avoid the place all together. I wish this place would go back to the way it started. It was a breath of fresh air. And the food and service was top notch.	0
For too long, the USC area has suffered from a complete lack of a decent cafe, with off-campus choices limited to Starbucks or Seattle&#39;s Best (the horror!). With Nature&#39;s Brew open, the north University Park area is finally getting something it deserves.<br><br>It&#39;s hard not to like the many things that Nature&#39;s Brew does well. It&#39;s a quality independent coffee shop that is neither too refined nor too grungy. The space is large, bright, and cozy, with a very spacious counter loaded with fresh pastries. There&#39;s a good variety of seating choices, including some large communal tables, and a few lounge chairs. As for the essentials, the coffee program offers a great quality at affordable prices. It&#39;s almost impossible these days to find good a espresso for $1.75, now $3 seems to be the new standard for new stores. As a nice bonus, all espresso drinks offer a choice between the house blend and Intelligentsia (typically $.75 extra). Sandwiches are the main food option here, they are of equally good value as the coffee.<br><br>Unfortunately, they haven&#39;t gotten it quite right for those looking for a place to get some work done. The music they play is unfortunately just loud enough to be annoying, so unless you&#39;ve got your own headsets, expect to put up with outdated radio-quality hip hop and R&amp;B.	1
Just had the best service here! Craig aka Pasta was our server and he was the nicest and most caring person ever. Took his time talking to all of his customers. He really did anticipate everything we needed. It's the small details that give you a better experience when dining in restaurants. Craig worked so hard, it was as if he owned the place!	1
Mea culpa: I have not read every single post. Has anyone mentioned the amazing tuna salad sandwich? It is my favorite anywhere. Just the right combo of tuna, mayo and pickles. The steak burger is my favorite beef burger anywhere. I love the funky ambiance. I always stand on the right side so that Hector is my server. The wait is never very long; even when I haven&#39;t been there in 6 months, Hector remembers that I want a steak burger with grilled onions, iced tea with extra lemons, fries well done . Of course, I occasionally blind-side Hector by opting for the tuna sandwich . He is so great that he remembers that I like extra pickles and olives. We are third generation customers. Love the consistency. Love Apple Pan.	1
This place is a huge rip-off. The 11$ steak sandwich ($12 with tax) is the size of a whitecastle slider. Absurd prices for tiny portions.	0
One of the best burgers you&#39;re going to find for miles. The burgers were juicy. I was even more impressed by the vanilla milkshake. The milkshake was so tasty I can see myself dropping by this summer just to pick one up. Not many people know about this place. A true hidden gem.	1
This place is open 24 hours, in a town that goes to bed at 11pm.Food is just okay.	0
Toast has a nice ambiance and is in a great area (it was a lot of fun to walk along 3rd and look in the stores after brunch). It was also lovely to sit outside on a nice day next to the little spice garden in the flower boxes. However, I was very disappointed by the food and the service was totally mediocre, It being brunch, I ordered Eggs Benedict...and it was not at all worth the calories. What was most disappointing was the flavorless breakfast potatoes. I have no idea why there was such a long wait.	0
Service was a bit shakey at first but then voila, service, wine, food, all delicious!! 2 TVs outside for World Cup, clean inside! Octopus was yummy	1
The food and service is good, but the interior atmosphere is funky - there&#39;s a moldy smell to the place.	0
Just because they have vegan pizza doesn&#39;t mean its good. Anybody can make a pizza with tons of cheese and meat and make it taste good, but you need good dough and a good sauce to pull off a good vegan pizza. Sadly Purgatory is not the place.	0
As a vegetarian I'd say this place is very overpriced for the quality of the food.	0
I have to have a BBQ pork humbow every time I pass this place; it's like some sort of irresitable magnetic attraction...	1
Let me start by saying that I think the food at Umami is fantastic! Unique burgers in a hip dining environment. Probably my favorite tasting burger in LA ahead of Father's Office, 8 oz Burgder Bar, Rustic Canyon and The Foundary.This review, however, is about the customer service I received on a recent visit. I arrived alone on a late Saturday afternoon and had about 45 minutes to kill before my girlfriend would be able to meet me. Because I wanted to try one of Umami's unique offerings, I asked the waitress to suggest a beer for me. At this point, another waiter/manager who was on his break, sitting on the patio behind me, starts raving about this amazing beer and suggests I try it. I say "sure". The waitress brings out what look like a miniature champagne bottle with cork and all. And in this moment, I can't help but think to myself that I've been had. It seems this worker has suggested what is likely the most expensive beer on the menu. So I take a few sips. And while this was one of the most unique beers I've tasted, it wasn't to my liking. I asked the waitress to take it a way and requested a pilsner. Out of courtesy, I even told her that I would be willing to pay for it, even though I had taken just a few sips. In all honesty, I thought there would be no way a waitress would charge me for this... I was clearly unsatisfied with her co-worker's recommendation.My girlfriend arrived and the rest of our dining experience was good... The special menu Ahi burgers were fantastic, a real treat. When it came time to pay they bill, there it was, a charge for a $28 beer that I had sent back after only a few sips. I was really disappointed by this, but decided to pay the bill and not make a fuss. This experience had left an unsavory taste in my mouth and I was ready to get on with my night.I think this is a fail on the part of Umami's customer service. I don't expect to pay for something that I send back. And even if I politely offer to pay, I expect a relationally intelligent and experienced business person to read between the lines, and refuse to take my money for a product or service that has not met my standards.	0
I came here with family based on the high 4+ star reviews it got. <br><br>The food was down right bad. Watery undercooked goat curry; tasteless chicken tikka masala; mattar paneer with no paneer; gajar halwa that needed more cooking; mint chutney that showed color and water. The only thing that they got right was the food colours :(<br><br>The ambience was fine: so it will do well with people who have no Indian cuisine experience and can&#39;t tell the stark difference between Indian food and whatever is being served here. <br><br>Lunch ended up being palak and naan (both of these were good).	0
I can always count on a good meal here. The gnocchi was great and a huge amount. Salads are also ample for sharing. The crab cakes are winners as well. I feel comfortable recommending this restaurant.	0
I love this place! Pastrami, Corned Beef, Chopped Liver! Seriously, I&#39;ll take all of it!	1
This menu gets boring. They need to add more daily specials or change the menu ONCE in a while.	0
Food never disappoints.  Our family of 12 goes every year and we leave stuffed with tons of leftovers!!  Service is always slow, but the wait is worth it!	1
Pricey and noisy, but has great food, service, and a cool artsy ambiance. Light-filled and charmingly distressed, this French eatery mostly hit all the right notes for me. I've been here twice, once for a regular dinner and another time for just a drink and bite at the bar and both times have been really good. On my first visit we had the mussels and frites, salad nicoise, and the braised lamb. The mussels and frites were perfection--tender mussels in a garlicky broth served alongside some truly scrumptious fries. The salad nicoise featured rare ahi, as opposed to cooked tuna, which was unexpected but delicious. Served atop fresh greens with different types of fingerling potatoes and heirloom tomatoes, it was a great salad. The braised lamb with mashed potatoes (or was it parsnips?) had great flavor, but the portion size was disappointingly small, especially considering the fact that the so-called "appetizers" had been quite generously sized. Oh well, c'est la vie. At least everything tasted great. The second time around I hung out at the bar. Not that big, but it makes for cozy dining and chatting. I ordered one of their flatbread pizza thingies called a Tarte Flambee and it was outstanding. Extra-thin, crispy crust topped with caramelized onions, bacon, and gruyere--mmm! Quite generously-sized, I might add. I also had one of their seasonal specialty cocktails called The Grass Anchor (see my pic)--I forget what was in it but it was really light and refreshing! They really do cocktails up right in here, with a hardworking mixologist behind the bar (fun to watch) and a seasonally changing menu. Definitely one of the best cocktails I've ever had. So between my two experiences I'd have to say I'd go back there in a heartbeat for a casual snack and drink at the bar over a full-on dinner, but their dinner menu is worth trying, too.	1
If I could give this place no stars even that would not be satisfactory...waiter insulted friends about leaving a &#34;shitty&#34; tip when in actually left a nice 30% tip...this has never happened anywhere else and I am severely disappointed with this establishment&#39;s professionalism	0
I had a cocktail that was a mix of cognac, champagne and lemon as my first drink at the Presidio Social Club, and yes, it was just as gross as it sounds. Maybe my impression of this place was skewed -- along with my palate -- by that toxic, horrible mixture of alcohols that have no business occupying the same glass, or maybe I felt like one of those strange misplaced alcohols as I attempted to mingle in the yuppified crowd at this place.There is only one vegetarian entree on the menu: a disgustingly bland and revoltingly expensive $15 macaroni and cheese. The side order of asparagus was blah, and the wine was straight up nasty. The saving grace of the meal was the dessert -- the lemon meringue pie was definitely edible. The dessert and appetizer sections of the menu were far more diverse (and appealing) than the entrees, and it was evident that people who know better go there only for side dishes, dessert and booze.Maybe I am just jaded, but I found the atmosphere so contrived it made my skin crawl. I'm not exactly a Pottery Barn aficionado, but I can see how some people would find it charming. Bottom line: great place to please the Norman Rockwell-esque crowd, but leave the people with taste at home.	0
OK. Let's just say you walk in and get really confused. I know, I know what you are going to say, figure it out you idiot!, However, I don't have time to figure this place out. You walk in, the menu is on the wall above and their are pieces of paper in little holders, categorized by pizza, salad, pasta etc.... The couple times I've been in (yes, I don't know why I came back) the papers are scattered all over the area and it's just messy, not to mention the place isn't the cleanest it could be. Actually, the last time I was there I just left. You could say it's a great place if you are really really really picky because there is probably a thousand ways you could eat your salad, but honestly should we be that picky, it's a restaurant, make what you think your customers will like and serve it for pete's sake! I've eaten there only twice, once I got a pizza, the second time I think I ordered a pasta with pesto...everything is so-so, definitely nothing spectacular, but it's cheap, very cheap, so I can see why it's still open.	0
Great spot! Very intimate and relaxing. Food was great!	1
Romantic rooftop bar/lounge above a delicious French bistro. Steak frites is extremely good, especially the reduction sauce. The meat was a little bit tough for a flank steak.Mussels are very good. Broth is 8/10, second only to Bin 941 in Vancouver, Canada so far in my experience. -1 for being a little cramped in the patio area, and for being a bit too dimly lit.	1
The design and the atmosphere here are great, every dish was delicious and the service was great!! Coming back soon.	1
Rich and decadent. It's small and popular which means getting a place to sit can be difficult. The food is on the heavier side but it is delicious. The Spanish Fly was quite possibly the most creative and enjoyable biscut experience I've had.	0
Working near time square leaves much to be desired in the way of decent lunch and bar options. I went for lunch with some co-workers. The prices are very reasonable and the portions are humongous. My grilled chicken sandwich with avocado was really good and they have these beef fat french fries with parm cheese, which were probably extremely caloric but highly delicious. The bar is really attractive and while it was sort of dead at lunch, I bet it gets busy during happy hour	1
The short:<br>- Great space<br>- Great staff<br>- OK coffee (at least the $1.25 stuff I get - haven&#39;t had an espresso yet)	1

Pretty cool chill place to grab some cheap happy hour food and beers. Wasabi fries and a burger. Food is pretty good. Nice little hidden place with a cozy feel. Nice little bar indoors. Parking can be a pain though. Pay attention or you might walk right past this place. Best to come on a warm evening.	1

We went downtown to the Wood Spoon b/c of Giada de Laurentiis&#39;s review of their pot pie on Food Network.<br><br>We were so excited to try the much hyped-about dish, but were greeted with nothing but downright rudeness.<br><br>Upon entering, no-one came to seat us. Waitresses bustled about serving various tables- they saw us standing in the restaurant by the entrance, but just walked on past. After about 5 minutes of awkwardly standing near the door with customers giving us odd stares, we were finally brought to a tiny table that was less than half a foot away from the next table. <br><br>When we requested to be moved to an empty table more towards the back of the restaurant, our waitress seemed very annoyed. She tossed down a menu- didn&#39;t ask us what we&#39;d like to drink, didn&#39;t provide any suggestions for the menu, and walked straight on into the kitchen. <br><br>Within minutes we were ready to order- we were planning to order the chicken pot pie and an appetizer of yucca- and tried to flag her down multiple times. As she passed our table for the third or fourth time, we even said to her &#34;Ma&#39;am we&#39;re ready to order please.&#34; What does she do? Turn right around and tend to another table. <br><br>Finally after about 20 minutes of sitting in the restaurant with no water, no food and not even a waitress willing to take our order, we got up and left. <br><br>Running a restaurant is two-fold. Your goal is provide good food and GOOD SERVICE. You may have the best chicken pot pie in the world for all I know, but that doesn&#39;t entitle you to be rude and negligent of your customers. Period.	0

REVIEW FOR BREAKFAST	0
As far as French bistros go, this is not one of my favorites. I ordered the Chicken Chez Moi, which was drowning in a butter sauce. Too much for my liking. It came with fries that were pretty low grade - kind of flavorless, kind of scrawny, kind of homogeneous.<br><br>The food wasn&#39;t necessarily bad, it was just kind of mediocre. I would rather spend my $17 on an entree somewhere else.	0
Wisconsin is known for beer - years ago my dad worked for Heilman Brewery in LaCrosse. The tradition continues at the four Great Dane Brewery locations.	0
Wonton Garden<br>56 Mott Street is the BEST Wonton Noodle Garden! and the BEST customer service!<br><br>For some reason there&#39;s a picture of the front of their building on this locations website--silver awning/red writing--that&#39;s really Wonton Garden at 56 Mott Street.<br><br>I think HK Wonton Garden (this site) is competing in a nasty manner :(	0
Hello Yelpers,<br><br>I use Yelp all the time and have yet to return the favor with a review. So, here it is...<br><br>Kush is amazing. It is just what Echo Park has been needing. I live in the building and was fortunate enough to attend the &#34;Soft Opening.&#34; We tried almost everything on the menu and there was not one dish that didn&#39;t make our eyes roll back into our head.<br><br>I talked to the Manager tonight and he said that they are not advertising yet, so it is only a matter of time until patrons from Park and Guisados start flocking to Kush. The owner started Silver Lake Ramen and based on the daily line out the door, he clearly knows what he is doing.<br><br>In Brief...<br>- AMAZING DISHES (cant go wrong with any item off the menu)<br>- GREAT BEER AND SAKE SELECTION<br>- INCREDIBLY FRIENDLY AND HOSPITABLE STAFF<br>- WON&#39; BREAK THE BANK<br>- FANTASTIC AMBIANCE<br>- STILL &#34;UN-DISCOVERED&#34; (no waiting list)<br>- GUARANTEED A FUN TIME <br><br>Now stop reading this and go!	1
I was expecting a really good cheeseburger and it was just OK. I think it's partially to do with the sauce they put on it, which I did not like. It was kind of like Russian dressing with relish in it or something. I also prefer to have a plate if I'm eating a burger at a restaurant - regardless of how casual it is. Even fast food places give you some kind of tray.... That kind of grossed me out. The fries were really good and I ate way too many of them, which may be why I am so bitter as I write this review.	0
beautiful restaurant with great potential. I went there tonite all excited about the fact that they have a &#34;veggie&#34; section on their menus just to get the &#34;evil eye&#34; from the manager the moment I mention the word &#34;vegan&#34;. The bartender was friendly and gracious when suggesting food and wine, but the manager and their whole menu (including wine list) was overly pretentious. Go take a walk on &#34;Corvo restaurant&#34; or even &#34;Flatbush Farm&#34; and maybe learn a thing or two on how to be foodies and still leave room for the huge demand of vegan dishes now. Of course, get some social skills as well, otherwise you&#39;ll live off the little hipster kids with no taste, which is not a bad thing but improve a bit and get out of your confort zone. They have a great space and great potential, just get a new manager and some new bar stools because those were really uncomfortable!	0
Really nice atmosphere to get a drink, and that&#39;s the main reason to come here, I think. The food is very good too.	1
Having traveled to Europe countless times, I have been spoiled with good bread, and the words Wonder, or Webers never seem to cross my mind. Americans have a skewed view on what bread really is and La Brea Bakery knows good bread. Yes, they have pre-made delicious sandwiches too, but the foundation for any good sandwich is good bread. This place simply does it right. You might stand in line early in the morning for the fresh stuff. Not sure if they still do this, but they used to serve coffee to those waiting in line. Enter the doors and inhale slowly!! With all the different breads all lined up, imagine the smell, there is nothing like it. Do yourself a favor, pay a visit and get a nice loaf of your favorite type of bread. It will change the way you think of bread. Sure there are other good bakeries, but this is on the top of my list, and I'm glad that over they years, they have been supplying markets and restaurants with quality breads.	1
You wouldn't think that it would be hard to find a decent philly steak sandwich in seattle. Just try. When your done being disappointed head to Tats. It's the best I have found with a lot of looking	1
Like every other restaurant / bar / club on the Strip, this place is stupidly overpriced, but what do you expect? I should have known our experience was going to be a bad one when the hostess told my friends and I there was going to be a 40 minute wait when I could clearly see empty tables throughout the place. As we&#39;re waiting, we notice groups of people coming in after us, yet they&#39;re getting seated no problem. One of my friends complains to the hostess and she says, &#34;Oh sorry, I thought you left.&#34; Seriously? We eventually get seated and place our orders with an overly excited server. The restaurant, though busy, isn&#39;t packed but for some reason, it takes a while for the food to get there. I guess the food was so-so, seeing as how some of my friends finished their food while others did not. We ask for the check and remembering how other reviewers posted to show a Total Rewards card for a discount, I handed my card to the server. The adjusted bill was a whopping $1.42 cheaper than it would have been had I not given him my card. Long story short, I really don&#39;t see why people love this place. I might come back if my friends put a gun to my head, but I think I&#39;d rather have them pull the trigger...	0
Yeah, this place is cool. If you want to wait 20 minutes for a milkshake that turns out to have been sitting ready for you for 10.	0
My girlfriend enjoyed it, I thought it was average. Cute little place with the most horrendous parking in the area. I hope they survive but the parking situation is so horrible I probably won&#39;t ever be back.	1
So i was driving down the street saw this place and decided to try it. First impression...VERY clean and well maintained. Very friendly and welcoming staff. This is probably the cleanest mexican restaurant i have ever been to. I ordered the carne asada burrito. Was solid ,nice pieces of meat i added my gringo guacamole and cheese. The only reason im not giving them a 5 is because the rice was bad. I hate when im trying to eat and i have to be careful i don&#39;t break a tooth on a stale piece of rice. If the rice had been fresh this would have been a 5. I will give them a pass on this as it was about 4 pm and i think they just didnt realize that it needed to be made again. I mentioned it to the lady and she was very professional and apologetic. I will definetly be back I am sure the rice was a miscue that rarely happens.	1
I had high expectations, the Quattro brothers have a distinguished reputation. But I left slightly disappointed. The veal meatball appetizer was rolled in bread crumbs and fried and still is had no taste. Special fo the day , Truffle pizza, had no truffle flavor though visually saw large slices of the stuff sprinkled on top. Was it really truffle?<br><br>The veal skirt steak in white mushroom sauce, though poorly named because does not resemble skirt steak, is my recommendation. Best Sangiovese wine I ever had ($11.00/gl). <br><br>I sat inside, the decor is hurting. The outdoor bar area needs sprucing up too. Front outdoor area is traffic noise.<br><br>Our waiter was very knowledgeable about ingredients and food preparation but I wish he steered us away from the truffle pizza	0
Continues to be consistently GREAT!	1
Old review. Been here MANY times with the wife. Definitely a good place to watch a game and have a beer. Food is good and they have a really excellent happy hour (food and drinks). Only beef is the service is a bit slow.	1
I tried going here at 7:30 on a Sunday. The open sign was on and the hours posted said they were open until 9. Too bad they were closed when I got there.	0
As always, the food was excellent. I would highly recommend the restaurant.	0
I expected it to be a bit better. I didn't really enjoy the waiter service, he definitely had attitude. The food was good though, the australian kingfish sashimi and the bacon and spinach baked oysters were really good. I had those two and one entree with two non alcoholic drinks and the bill was about $90. You cannot expect to walk out of here without the bill being at least $50. The view was beautiful and it's definitely a place where you can feel the money floating around you.	0
I celebrated my birthday here a few days ago and had a great time. My partner and I enjoyed the Living Social deal and ordered the Prix Fix allowing us to each choose an appetizer, entree and dessert. <br><br>The only reason I give this restaurant 4 stars instead of 5 was because I was really looking forward to sharing a cute, romantic goat cheese fondue but when it came it was way too small for each of us to have more than a few tiny bites. Although I know this is an &#34;appetizer&#34; it was still too small for the price - practically a shot glass of cheese. The tuna appetizer was amazing, however, and both of us loved the entrees. The desserts were also great, and they topped mine with a cute birthday cake-topper with a big sparkler. <br><br>We were seated in one of the adorable side booths with the curtains and it was a great, private dining experience (the way I like it!). The owner sent over glasses of champagne for us to celebrate my birthday, but what I really enjoyed was the small glass of French dessert wine I had to top everything off. <br><br>I would definitely return to Luna Park in the future, especially for a special occasion.	1
This seemed like an amazing brunch place to celebrate my boyfriend's 21st birthday post-night of celebration. Warm summer Sunday afternoon, rooftop, beautiful view and a menu with a great selection of healthier and delicious options. The pictures looked beautiful and it seemed like a great setup and idea...SEEMED. Day of, we had a pretty bad experience. So they have a pool in the middle of the rooftop "restaurant" and there are tables and chairs right next to the pool. You know, there's a pool at the Standard and that works great so i didnt think it would be a problem. However, this afternoon (and I dont know if this just happened to be on this day) there were kids in the pool, splashing, screaming and playing the whole time we were trying to enjoy our brunch. Let me just say, I got the egg white scramble and it was really good! However, I prefer not to eat my brunch with pool water constantly splashed into it on a backdrop of screaming kids playing Marco Polo and jumping into the pool. Hello, where are your parents?? Do they not realize there are other people there without swimsuits on, trying to enjoy their meals?I get that its also a hotel but if you're going to let your pool be open during the day, don't seat guests inches away from the side of the pool. Also, it wouldn't hurt to have a few rules about horse play...Anyways, our waiter tried to make up for it and apologized, but it just couldn't make up for the overall sour experience. I will say that the place seems like it would be an amazing place for drinks at night...when the pool is closed and kids are asleep. It's such a shame that this happened, it could've been such a great experience. The food was good (without pool water), the view was so nice, but the pool and the kids and my chlorine meal...	0
Great view and ambiance. Welcoming staff, clean bar, patio and restaurant. We had the Lamb sliders, brussels sprouts and ahi tuna tartar. Although the tartar could have used some more umf...everything else made up for it absolutely. The spicy concombre is a must try. I'll be back for that burger and concombre for sure.	1
Great Happy Hour spotThe sangria carafe is just enough to forget you day's worries and get into the delicious tacos!Had the chicken keep BBQ which was a nice twist to the usual beef!Added a vegan mushroom taco which was deep fried to absolute perfection.The shrimp in Shimai probably was the best tasting of the night.Last but not least the pork belly had great flavor I just wasn't crazy about the nuts	1
I really wanted to like this place. But the food speaks for itself. Had the moules frites. Over cooked, mushy mussels, OK broth, no bread to soak it up with, not that i wanted to but. Fries were good. The ribs in belgian ale with mashed potatoes sounded really good. But what we got was basically pot roast drowned in an OK sauce with average mashed potato's. I got the feeling that this place was a one trick pony. There must be one thing on the menu that is good (the burger?), and if you just stick with that. Because the place was packed and the ambiance was great. Too many other restaurants out there for me to try..	0
I threw away entire general changs entree after three bites. Absolutely no chicken just breading. No Vegetables in VEGETABLE Lo Mein an neither in VEGETABLE fried rice . Lo Mein taste like the cardboard box it came out of. I just took a few bites an I cant stop repeating &#34;burping&#34; that grub. Complete garbage food prepared by cheap bastards. Any review telling you this place is good is from people who never left kendall. Any cuban cafeteria can cook this shit.	0
Delicious food and delicious drinks. Had the burger and pimento cheese fries were fantastic! I love a nice cocktail and they didn&#39;t disappoint. <br><br>Decor is nice. There are tables but not that many, it&#39;s a great place if you like to sit at the bar as the bar is the focus of the restaurant.	1
Had a really solid burger here, the au poivre had just the right amount of pepper and the truffle fries were like crack. Had to wait a little while for a table at 8 on a Friday but it&#39;s good to see them busy, hopefully means they&#39;ll be around a while -- there are some kinks to work out with the staff, our waitress was a bit flighty -- buy overall really a great place.	1
We went on a Sunday night and while the place was busy they weren't full by any means. We waited about 25 minutes to be sat even though there were at least 4 tables open the entire time we were waiting and no reservations ever showed up. The hostess was very awkward and provided no explanation for the wait. The burger itself was good but for $13 it wasn't worth the fact that it came with no sides. We were charged for a small container of sauce my medium burger was more similar to steak tartare and the garlic fries were so covered in raw garlic it burned to eat them.	0
View of Construction site is not a pleasant site for a high end dining experience. Service tried very hard but lacking. Tried the recommended Bordeaux but was not as near as good as promoted. Experience was ok and would consider visiting again but prices do not equate to the experience offered. Have eaten at the Black Olive as well as other resteraunts in the area and would recommend them first.	0
The bread pudding was amazing and the server efficient as well as pleasant.	1
5 stars because there isn&#39;t one thing I didn&#39;t like about this place.<br>French fries: Delicious, and perfectly cooked.<br>Hickory burger: Delicious, and juicy and quality and filling... and I could keep gushing.<br>Apple Pie a la mode: Delicious, and warm and cinnamon-y.<br>Guy behind the counter: Awesome, and working his butt off. Seriously, give that guy a raise!	1
I really like the restaurant's interior but one of the best things about it is that they have these huge windows that completely open so if you're sitting near them it's practically like sitting outside. Great for summer. The food is really good. We started with an octopus appetizer and baked oysters. I didn't care for the octopus that much (although everyone else in my dining party liked them) but the oysters were delicious. For my entree I had a soppressata pizza which was also delicious. The other people in my dining party had the daily catch (salmon) meatballs and polenta and the pork chop. Everyone enjoyed their meal. They have a nice little cocktail list and a great wine list. Our waiter was great and was very knowledgeable about the wine and food. I highly recommend this place.	1
I liked the view. The food was average, nothing to rave about. I've had A LOT better, I've had a LOT worse. I think I will stick with the drinks here, since really, it's all about the view. The tables were cramped but the outdoor dining area is very limited so that was to be expected. The service was great. We were seated right away and the waitress was helpful and attentive. Honest opinion, skip dinner and go for drinks and sociable atmosphere.	1
Don&#39;t even want to give them a star! <br>First of all, been waiting outside for 1 hour yesterday night, but that;s ok its Saturday night and I don&#39;t mind wait for 1 hour for good food.<br>Waitress service was bad, no patient and didn&#39;t even introduce anything!<br>Expensive, but not much food.....59.99 Combo C is not enough for 2 people!!	0
black beans very bland.. chicken in the salad ..very bland.. steak salad very very small.	0
Let&#39;s keep it simple, just like everyone that was inside of DeFonte&#39;s. Real simple.<br><br>Every time I have driven by DeFonte&#39;s trying to grab a sub, they have been closed. It was actually a running joke between my girlfriend and I, because they were never open. Finally one morning, we made it in, but still only a couple of minutes before they were closing.<br><br>Besides being closed all the time, I had heard that the egg and potato sandwich is delicious. One person called it the best breakfast sandwich they had ever had! Once it was wrapped up and we got back to the house, I gave it a shot. Delicious. I was very impressed with the taste, texture, and fillingness of the entire sandwich, since I only had half. DeFonte&#39;s doesn&#39;t look too amazing when you walk in and to add to that, they had the eggs&amp;potatoes in a buffet style set-up. I thought that they could not be that good. I was wrong and happy to be wrong.<br><br>I&#39;m not too sure if I will be back to DeFonte&#39;s for anything else except the egg&amp;potato sandwich and maybe a chicken sandwich of some sort, but I am sure I will be back.	1
THANK YOU for opening, Velvet Taco! This is such an amazing addition to the Gold Coast! My friends and I went the first night they were open to the public and tried a variety of menu items. We all loved our tacos, super fun soft drinks and incredible apps. This place is a must-go ASAP - you won&#39;t be disappointed!	1
Not sure if I came on on a bad day but it was the worst gnocchi I&#39;ve ever had. My friend&#39;s dish was just okay. I believe it was the penne with eggplant and mozzarella. I really wanted to like this place. One plus is the bread was delicious.	0
I have been meaning to try this place for awhile & finally had the chance. The eggs were amazing and it lived up to the great reputation. The only drawback was possibly that it got rather noisy and our table was in a crowded location, but the food was worth it!	1
Two stars cuz the food is good. Why i give low ratings? Never make a hungry man wait to long! Walked in and got seated after 5min. What started to irritate me more is that no one came to approach us and ask for drinks or anything within the next 15min. Wtf! What pissed me off more is a bigger group got their fkn water and their burgers before us. Smh Thanks for making this hawaii boy disappointed on my very first experience of this place.	0
Ok, so I am devoted foodie, and this was place was a pleasure.  I am going to say that the Latin side of the menu was more successful than the Asian side - felt a little like the menu holds back for maximum accessibility (always an expectation for a Vegas food audience), but there were a couple of standouts.  All the tacos were very good, but the tendon and oyster taco was truly a unique offering and had the flavor and texture that lived up to the fusion promise.  I would definitely go back again without hesitation.	1
This place is solid. Service is good, food isn't very complex nor are the combinations very noteworthy but it tastes fresh and leaves the belly happy. A couple of things would make pink door a solid 5. The plastic on the ceiling is a little off putting and the bathrooms are pretty rancid. Other than that, the burlesque show is entertaining and it is hard not to enjoy yourself in this lively atmosphere. I would definitely recommend a visit to the pink door, I had a great time and so will you if you can find it.	0
The sushi is wonderful!<br>They have quite a few specialty rolls that are different than what you typically find.	1
This place has everything going for it. It's in a very hip part of LA, lots of cool folks in the restaurant, great American comfort food that is elevated into new presentations, and a very comfortable dining room. We had the french toast souffle, oyster po boy with some of the best roasted potatoes around, salmon pizza, braised and then grilled artichokes, and a frittata. They serve a mean cup of joe as well.We were there on a Sunday morning and the place was packed. Our wait was 45 minutes, but we grabbed some coffee at their take-out location next door. Parking can be a little tough. We found some street parking close by.	1
Had lunch at India Bistro on Roosevelt today. Nice selection on the lunch buffet. Service was attentive but didn't check on me every two minutes like some restaurants. Many different kinds of Naan on the big menu. The bar looked to be very well stocked with all kinds of spirits beer and wine. That have happy hour starting at 3pm and goes for 3 hours. Check 'em out!	1
One of my very favorite bakeries, ever. The nicest staff and great new location. My favorite things (sweet tooth obsessions) are: macaroons, chocolate chip cookies, licorice, and hot chocolate!!! Although, not all at the same time as that would put me into a sugar coma. You and your sweet tooth will not be disappointed.	1
the mac and cheese is hands down my favorite mac and cheese. love the simplicity of it and the black pepper spice.	1
I hadn&#39;t been to Calle Ocho in years (before it moved to the Excelsior Hotel). I have a very hard time believing this is the same restaurant.<br><br>First off, our food arrived about 6 minutes after placing the order. NOTHING takes only 6 minutes to prepare, unless it&#39;s not actually being prepared to order. Furthermore, when one of the dishes is paella, then 6 minutes is entirely unacceptable.<br><br>The &#34;sweet &amp; green plantains&#34; were fried plantain chips that were neither sweet or even warm.<br><br>The Camarones were sweet shrimp on top of a nasty tasting, seemingly asian inspired avocado &#34;salad.&#34; I love avocado, but this was bordering on disgusting. <br><br>The Paella tasted like Uncle Ben&#39;s rice that seafood was thrown on top of at the end. The rice had no flavor at all from the seafood, no toasted bottom, and THE SEAFOOD WAS COLD. You can&#39;t even pretend the seafood was cooked in the rice if it&#39;s COLD!<br><br>The stuffed chicken was acceptable, but it&#39;s supposed to come with sausage and I got 1 tiny half inch diameter sliver of sausage. <br><br>The only things I can recommend from Calle Ocho are the rolls. <br><br>Stay away. This place is one of the worst places I&#39;ve eaten at in years.	0
I went in expecting great chicken and I got was bland soggy chicken. It was just awful, I would never recommend this place. The service was fantastic, but I wanted great chicken with flavor!	0
Little bear, Little bear,Touch the ground.Little bear, Little bear,Turn around.Little bear, Little bear,Show your shoe.Little bear, Little bear,That will do.Remember this nursery rhyme? If you do, I bet you'll have a fun time singing this song while buzzed and doing the movements!!! Any who.... Lets get down to bisnazz!Rating: 3 1/2 stars for now....Parking/location: Plenty of street parking at night, but it's a bit sketch. Make sure you bring your own cape crusader if you can. Located on Mateo St. and Industrial. This gastropub is across the street from Church and State bar.Decor/ambiance: From the outside, the light lighting at night drew me to this place and the decor modern. The place is dim and to set the mood they have a candle lit..... Ooooh laaaaa laaaaa... how romantic! Good for bromancing, sismancing, couples, friends that you secretly like, and spending time with good friends. It can be loud here. Service was a bit slow, but the server tried his best. The place seemed a bit understaffed tonight.Cost: I thought the price of the burger was not worth $15 dollars, I guess you are paying more for the experience/ambiance.Food: Had the Little Bear burger (mushrooms, cheese, angus beef, caramelized onions which was served either with belgium fries or a small salad). I chose the belgium fries that came with a side of aioli sauce and ketchup. Loved the burger! It was packed with a lot of flavor with every bite.Beer: Come here for belgium beeeer! Will be backkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk for s'moreeeeeeeeee!!!!!!	1
Service is crap, prices a little high, environment is chill with a nice selection of table options.	0
Food was great but the service could use quite a bit of work. We were seated and had to ask for service twice before water was brought and it was not very busy. Again, for was good but service left a lot to be desired	0
The locale and the crowd looks out of place in this part of town, is very modern and has a very good vibe.<br><br>We went on a Friday night and the place was packed, so we waited for around 10 minutes and luckily we got a table next to the door.<br><br>On the topic of the food we only had the japanese menu and it was ok nothing really especial, the prices are a little high for the amount served, overall I think is a good venue but the should up their food quality and lower the prices a bit.<br><br>Now the service was really bad, the owner was there and he was nice but everyone else was very slow it took almost 1:30 to get us soup, 3 rolls an the check.<br><br>I will try it again in the future	0
21 is the first Korean bar/club that I know of in Vegas that reminds me of ones that are modeled after other establishments in other cities such as L.A., and Annandale, VA. But, 21 definitely follows the sound of its own horn providing such a unique and impressive setting.<br><br>I&#39;ve been here a multitude of times. From Elite Events, UYE&#39;s, to just informal get-togethers, 21 has regularly bestowed upon me a service that has been dependable, and drinks that are solid.<br><br>Foodwise, I commonly order the dried squid and file fish on the appetizer menu. It&#39;s a fairly uncomplicated dish which totally complements beer and soju drinks. I&#39;ve tested numerous other items on the menu, and they are more favorable than other comparable establishments.<br><br>On Wednesdays, there is a DJ that spins club music, and during this time, this venue gets swarming with crowds of folks looking to get their freak on.<br><br>New note: 21 has just a while ago constructed individual karaoke rooms, for inebriated hijinks, or for those wanting to develop into the successor of Mariah Carey (or Mark Carey...)	1
I came in yesterday with a pretty big group of ten plus we sat on the patio which was very nice. The waitress was very polite and was checking on us pretty consistently :). This was the first time I had been there since it was redone and I really liked how it looked. My friend and I tried the Chipotle Chicken and Wild Rice soup it was so delicious even on that very hot day so kudos to that! I also tried one of the fried pickles with the sauce it came with it was also very good! Had a good time here.	0
I've gone here for a couple of times and I must say when I first came in here I felt like I was cheating on boiling crab for a minute but then after I finished my first meal here I realize it didn't really differ that much when it comes to food. They're as close as you can get plus they serve some Thai dishes too. The only difference is that they have NO WAIT TIME plus free parking in the back!! Which really seals the deal for me. Specially when you're really hungry you won't have to worry about any wait time when you arrive or the hassle looking for a parking spot. You can literally come here any day or any time of the week and you'll get seated almost right when you arrive. Definitely non of that 2 hour wait time at boiling crab. Now, I'm a French fries kind of girl and I love boiling crab's Cajun fries but their Cajun fries here are slightly different they're a little thicker and the seasoning is not the same but they're still good nonetheless. The shrimp's flavor and size is not exactly the same as boiling crab's shrimps but like I said it's as close as you can get. The service is really great. They have really nice and polite servers, they'll accommodate you as much as they can. Definitely my go-to spot when boiling crab is over packed.	1
I love this place! It always feel like you're eating with friends in this cozy, cute restaurant. Great prices and generous portions of good food!	0
I'm with Izzy D!	1
I. Love. This. Place.	1
I wanted to love this place, but I'm pretty much done.The food is just okay. You can get the same thing for literally half the price many other places in the city, bacon jam included.The service has been pretty terrible each time I come here. I've been ignored for 20+ minutes before, and other similar experiences. I know it's hard to run a restaurant, so in the past, I just grin and bear with it. But, today takes the cake.I want to start off by pointing out that I am a great customer. I regularly tip 20 to 25% - I'm in the service industry too, and I know what it's like to live off tips. Also, 90% of the time I will totally forgive mistakes in my order. It's pretty rare that I will actually return something, only if it is completely inedible. That's probably happened once in the last 5 years.I ordered a breakfast sandwich with the egg cooked medium, and a bottomless grapefruit mimosa. I made the decision to get bottomless based on the fact that, according to the menu, one mimosa costs $8 and bottomless mimosas cost $15. I knew I planned on having at least 2, possibly 3 so I figured it would be a good deal.The egg on the sandwich arrived sunny side up, and cooked easy. It was pretty distinctly easy, as it had a layer of snotty slimey egg white on it. Oh whatever, I thought, my bad for making the order complicated. I simply removed the slime as best I could with my finger, leaving it to look like a freshly hawked loogie on my plate.The bill arrived and I saw that I had been charged $17 for my bottomless mimosa. Oopsies, but that's okay, mistakes happen. I was sure that once I pointed out this mistake, one of two things would happen:1. My server would bring over the menu and show me where it says $17 for a bottomless mimosa. I mean, I was pretty sure it said $15, but if she could prove me wrong I would be happy to pay $17.2. My server would say, sorry for the mistake, and bring me a new bill with the correct amount on it. I would be pleased.Well, neither #1 nor #2 happened, even though there was only two appropriate responses. My server came over and informed me that grapefruit mimosas cost $2 more. I responded, "The menu says $15 for bottomless mimosas. That's the only price it gives. It does not say that there are different prices for different mimosas."But, even though it was her mistake for not telling me, she wouldn't budge. I became angry. It's not just her, many of the staff here are distracted. Maybe they could use better management.	0
1st time we went, it was so yummy, so I went back again w/ a friend. Horrible. They have updated the menu so u can do combo. My friend had the Mabo Don. The sauce was like this weird jelly texture. There was globs of jelly like pieces. Must have been that the cornstarch wasn't mix in completely with the sauce. The ramen pork was extremely salty & the broth had no depth to it. No next time for me again.	0
Ordered a vanilla latte, was told they didn&#39;t have syrups. Then thought of getting a cup of soup, before noticing such a cup costs $7. Then settled on a slice of pie, which is apparently $7 also. Asked for it warmed, and was told that warming it was unwise. Ended up paying $12 for a tiny mocha and a cold piece of pie. Then, even worse, I came in to do work and all of the available tables had little signs on them classifying them as &#34;laptop-free.&#34;<br><br>Left very annoyed and vowing never to return.	0
Now an interesting thing happens with the clientele here. It seems that the "local characters" sit on the right side of the room, and everyone else sits on the left. So you have the people who need to take a load off their feet and read their paper and eat some good, cheap food on one side; and the college students, tourists, families, and business people on the other side."	1
What a gem this place is, here is what you need to know:<br><br>- The owner Vic is so nice and took time to take care of all patrons<br>- Huge selection of beer to accompany great food <br>- The Biblio 75 is a must-have cocktail<br>- The mac n&#39; cheese is some of the best i&#39;ve had in New York<br>- The burger is also a must try<br><br>If you haven&#39;t checked this place out yet, do so now!	1
I just picked up my take out order an brought it back to the hotel I'm staying in. The staff was extremely attentive and friendly. The food does seem a bit greasy than other Thai restaurants I've been too but it's still delicious!	1
Their hot dogs are a bit overpriced, but when you think about a Dodger Dog being the same price with about a third of the extra toppings and sauces, I&#39;d say it&#39;s worth it.<br><br>* Green dog - Yuumm. Guacamole spread was subtle but definitely noticeable. And with the lobster roll (basically a toasted crust-less hot dog bun), it was so filling!!<br>* Dirty fries - Fine, but nothing special IMO.<br>* Iced coffee - Really good, but that&#39;s because I like SWEEET coffee (it has condensed milk, if that&#39;s any indication). If you&#39;re not into coffee that tastes like sugar and rainbows, I wouldn&#39;t recommend that you get this.<br>* Fried Oreos - It&#39;s extremely unhealthy but SO GOOD. The fried food scene in LA is seriously lacking (fried pickles, anyone??), so I was super happy to see it as an option here. Might frequent this place JUST for the fried Oreos.<br><br>Service was nice - cashiers are very helpful if you&#39;re indecisive or a first-timer. There&#39;s also no AC so it gets pretty stuffy. <br>Overall, don&#39;t come here if you&#39;re looking to lose weight and/or are easily tempted. I guarantee that you will order an unhealthy amount of unhealthy food.	1
The last time I went here I was served sweet potato fries that gave me and five of my friends horrible diarrhea. Instant one star for lack of proper food safety.	0
The Lomo saltado was fantastic! My friend had a seafood soup and it was amazing as well! Definitely visit this gem.	1
It's open 24-7. That's good. The ambiance is fun and funky. Also good. And they have fish and chips that are quite good, with some sort of french fry dipping sauce that's got red pepper in it that's mindblowing.Then I decided to try their spicy penne. I'm not going to say it was lacklustre, but the pasta was beyond al dente and the garlic bread was... I'll settle on inelegant. The garlic was aggressive, and didn't mingle well with the bread. You're allowed to describe food like that, right?Also, if you're not wearing a short skirt, try the window seat. It's a cool little nook that you probably wouldn't know about.	1
The beer is fantastic BUT the food was meh. I had the chicken sausage. Could have had a better sausage from Costco. I like their Nutella chocolate pudding though.	0
Young Dong!? I wonder how many creepy perverts have wandered over to this joint based on the name with the misconception of what they would find. Wasn't sure what to order here, but the owner's son was a table away and was kind enough to point us in the right direction. So great! I had the number 3 which he said was the most popular. It's the beef with fat. Fat makes everything taste better. Being the broth is pretty straight forward you'll want the fat to add a little flavor. You dress it up yourself so don't be shy on adding salt, pepper, green onions, kimchee, rice, etc. Whatever floats your boat. Otherwise, it'll taste bland. They also have kimchee water, but I thought that'd just water it down. The noodles inside are thin and holds it's firmness. They provide a jalapeno dipping sauce for the meat. I'd come back on a cool, windy day or if I was feeling under the weather. Very comforting like my great grandma used to make. Great grandma approved!Parking: private lot in back I believe. Or you can park down a side residential street across Wilshire.	1
Although I was excited from all the good reviews, I was sadly disappointed about my experience here.<br><br>I had the livingsocial deal, like many others, and noted that when making the reservation. When I got there, the reservationist berated me slightly for not having printed out the voucher (I used the code on my phone) - that was slightly annoying, but not really a big deal. He brings us up to the second floor, which my boyfriend and I found quite pretty and intimate (especially with the lights on the trees right outside the window). <br><br>The service was superb - the waiters were very attentive and polite, and I was very pleased with that aspect. Our appetizers were mixed (bacon - delicious, comparable to Luger&#39;s, the calamari - average), but we were really excited for our steaks (filet mignon for me, hanger steak for him). IT came, we cut into it, and I instantly noticed that mine seemed overdone for my taste, and his more rare for his tastes. He had ordered medium steak - me medium rare. Okay, seems like they may have switched up our orders. Annoying, but we&#39;ll deal.<br><br>As we&#39;re talking to the staff (a manager?) about the mixup, they happily take my boyfriend&#39;s back (since they can just reheat it), but they insisted that my steak was done right. It was not. I am a medium rare steak girl, my boyfriend is a medium guy, and we both knew that the steak was medium, and not what I had asked for. The staff leaves without taking the steak back, and another staff member (the same manager) walks by asking if everything is alright. My boyfriend exclaims that my steak was overdone and that we wanted to send it back. They again examined the steak, said that &#34;that is medium rare,&#34; and asked if I wanted it black and blue. I&#39;m pretty sure there is a huge discrepancy between the two. Anyhow, the steak was redone, this time, too rare for my liking (NOT black and blue at least, but definitely more rare than medium rare), but I was too annoyed with the attitude to want to speak with the staff again, as I simply wanted a pleasant evening.<br><br>Ultimately, I was very disappointed with how they handled the situation. I am sure that they get customers ordering their steak the wrong way, but it felt extremely unprofessional when they insinuated that I did not know what I was talking about, and I would not return because of that. <br><br>They get 2 stars because the waiters were great, and the other food wasn&#39;t bad (I gotta say the spinach was impressive, my boyfriend and I wolfed it down as we waited for our steaks to be returned).	0
This place is in my neighborhood so I&#39;ve been there at least a half dozen times. The service is friendly yet inconsistent. The real problem here is the food. We&#39;ve been served cold food more than once, and flavorless food just about every time. The only positives are the low prices and ample parking. There are so many other places to go for good Colombian food.	0
They must have changed up the recipes in the kitchen, because the low reviews from late 2014 are quickly being swept away by good reviews in 2015. Went in apprehensive but was quickly wowed by great service, and happily discovered my new favorite wing joint!<br><br>Not many sauce choices, but all the flavors I&#39;ve tried have been good.<br>Voodoo: sriracha+soy, surprisingly good!<br>Garlic parm: strong garlic flavor, my new favorite.<br>Lemon pepper: this version is a dry rub with some oil.<br>Hot &amp; Sweet: like a mango habanero elsewhere, not too spicy.<br><br>Wing are good-sized and meaty, unlike my experiences with other wing chains. Menu also has sides like fries, fried pickles, and cole slaw, but the service is top-notch! Friendly staff at the register remembered my name and order after a single visit, always super cheerful. They do have a drive-thru available.	1
Burger was cooked to perfection as requested, medium well. Side salad could have used a bit more of the house dressing they stated, other than it tasting like a lite olive oil drizzle and some salt and if any pepper seasoning.	1
Hey you! Are you lookin' for a cup of coffee and a selection of comfort foods or maybe a delicious sandwich or pastry to get your drunk ass home after 2 A.M.? Or you might want to be served by a cute, surly, little old lady who doesn't like your haircut and is possibly pissed she has to work the overnight shift? If so then this may be your place. I mean seriously this place is an icon. It has so much history and a legacy of great food and good times to uphold. I would give this place 4 stars just on the amount of fun I have had here and the things and people I have seen over the years. People watching here is A+ and adds to the nostalgia. Plus it's 24 hours. You have to appreciate having anything this great available to you at all hours of the day. And if Max's across the street is crowded you can always hit the Kibitz Room. Sit in Rodney's booth if he isn't...Or join him.	1
Finding a parking spot may be a bit challenging especially on a sunny day, but with time and patience, you should be able to find one right outside this restaurant. There is plenty of seating both outside and inside.	0
Another over rated and over priced burger place, dry wagyu burger...what a shame, ordered it medium rare and was over cooked to medium well..	0
This place sucks! I went to college in Louisiana so I know how crawfish are supposed to taste. But never mind that, this place was out of crawfish. So, I tried the blue crab. There was some bright orange crap inside of them that tasted like muck, the seasoning looked like they just threw it in the pail, the meat had absolutely no flavor. I sent it back. Then I ordered the shrimp thinking 'you can't ruin shrimp'. WRONG! You can. Again NO FLAVOR. I mean ZERO. I only went here because the one on Wilshire had a line out the door. I should have known something was wrong with this place because it was nearly empty. EPIC FAIL. Do yourself a favor and go to another spot, maybe the one on Wilshire is good but this one is worse than Nicki Minaj's makeup.	0
I made the mistake of taking this places advice and ordering online. I was quoted 45 minutes for delivery of a taco and chimichanga. After an hour and 15 minutes, the food finally arrived.	0
My wife and I came here for the restaurant week and we wish we picked somewhere else.We tried to make a reservation for lunch but was unsuccessful on every single day. So we made one for the dinner. Before we mentioned about the restaurant week, the staff didn't even bother to let us know there's a separate menu for the event.The waitress is very pushy. Without any explanation of the menu, she asked us about four times even I told her we need a few more moments to go through it.The food was disappointing, too. My wife ordered a bento box while I tried the restaurant week menu. Her salmon was cooked to a completely black color and of course it tastes bitter. So we called the manager over, and his response was, quote, &quot;What do you want me to do?&quot;I don't know, man. Isn't this your restaurant?	0
I&#39;ve been to Verde twice now, and must say that despite some of the prices being slightly high, the food doesn&#39;t disappoint. What is especially nice is the scenery, with a very beautiful view of the Biscayne Bay and the Port of Miami. I&#39;ve tried the Verde Cheeseburger and the Chicken Club sandwich, and both were delicious. The fries that come with the sandwiches are the thin cut variety, and are soooo good. Recommend this place for a nice lunch!	1
good food good service. can&#39;t complain~<br><br>wasabi fries r not that great as people say<br><br>its just regular crappy fries w wasabi sauce. atleast make the fries better~ or infuse the sauce w it somehow<br><br>looove their shrimp pizza!<br><br>teriyaki sliders were a bit salty<br><br>but affordable and yes id come again :)	1
Love this place! :) <br>I came here on a Saturday night around 1am with the BF and we expected it to be packed, but it wasn&#39;t too bad. Yummy trim pastrami sandwich on rye. I like this place more than johnnie&#39;s pastrami! The brisket was moist and delicious. I love the atmosphere. It feels like a very laid back diner full of life and great service. I&#39;ll definitely be coming back ;)	1
Do you like any of the below?<br><br>(a) rice<br>(b) adobo<br>(c) eggs<br>(d) feeling full<br><br>If you picked any of the letters above, adobo fried rice is a must.	1
for a place where the food is ehhhh im thinking the service should make up for it. wow was i wrong. i was in line they didnt acknowledge me. they were rude when i asked if someone could take my order. and the hot sandwich i ordered came to me cold. ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh i just went to mc donalds. at least they say " hi, can i take your order"	0
Went to this restaurant after seeing some positive on-line reviews. Chose to sit outdoors because the weather was nice. Despite being seated next to some other couples, the service was subpar, to say the least.   The food was pretty good, although the carbonara had an unusual taste compared to other carbonaras I've had. The pasta alla vodka was very good. After our main dishes were served, the waitress didn't come by once to check on us or see how our meal was, and it wasn't a very busy night. We also didn't have anyone come by to refill our water.   I've eaten out quite a bit and never remember that ever happening anywhere else.   Reasonably priced food and poor service are how I will remember this restaurant.	1
My review is based on lunch take out: I ordered beef chow fun and it was horrible! The noodles were swimming in oil and very bland. To make things worst, I had to pay $9 for it!	0
love the fact that they have pie from four twenty , the sandwiches are delicious as is the coffee	1
Beautiful location, but way to pricey for a mediocre diner	0
horrible customer service, food was stale, so disappointed with customer service.	0
I've eaten at Diablo's a few times and it has always been very good.  The food and service is always great.  The restaraunt sits right on the Strip, so it is a great place for people watching.  It's open late, so it is great after the shows get out.	1
I came here for lunch right before a meeting. It was during the middle of the week, during lunch time.Con: the waiter was all over the place. I don't think he was the normal waiter (i assumed he was the bartender who was covering for the waiter). We had to ask him back several times (how many times do i have to ask for a water???).Aside from the service, my burger was friggin' delicious! Juicy, well flavored, and the bun was really soft and buttery. The ambiance was very cool. Hopefully, my next experience will be a bit better, because I definitely have to try their burger one more time.Oh, and the menu made it really hard to decide, becuase everything looked so good. Lots of beer and good eats!	1
twice i have seen drunks gay bashing here during the sunday brunch and the staff and management do nothing. not the kind of place i want to support or any of my friends (gay or straight) to be subjected to.	0
I used to only go there for a quick lunch but now me and my girlfriend get all of our deli meats/cheese and BBQ stuff from them when we can. <br><br>Favorite sandwich there is definitely the pulled pork sandwich.<br><br>*Warning they sometimes have a 50/50 burger that is half beef and half bacon and it is really intense. I&#39;d recommend getting the regular burger and just adding bacon unless you are a bacon fanatic.<br><br>The smoked turkey and the tri-tip steak are great for DIY sandos and wraps.<br><br>It would be great if they were able to sell the brioche buns and other breads they use for sandwiches because the hamburger buns currently at La Tropicana aren&#39;t cutting it...maybe someday they will- this place keeps getting better all the time!	1
Tried the tomato soup and loved it. Orded the medium size and it&#39;s enough for two people. It&#39;s very cheap, that&#39;s nice too. Not a great atmosphere but the staff is very friendly.	1
MAKE A RESERVATION!! it will save you SO much time. i made reservations for my bf and i for a saturday night at 10:30pm and when we arrived, we were so glad we made those in advance because we got to bypass a huge, slow moving line. we still had to wait for 30mins before we were seated, which kind of sucked, but i guess i can understand unforeseen circumstances and it was a busy saturday night. this rooftop lounge has amazing views of DTLA and the ambiance is perfect for a date night or just hanging out with friends. the music is chill, lounge-y music, so don't expect to get down and dance. i liked that it was lively, but not too crazy loud so we could still have a conversation over some appetizers and yummy drinks. the writer's block drink was refreshing and light, with pear undertones. i wouldn't recommend the pork belly appetizer as it was a chunk of underwhelming pork belly in a light sauce. we saw there was another line that takes you to the uppermost floor, but even on the regular floor, the views were amazing. this place was a hit and my bf and i both loved it. would definitely recommend for some light drinks and food. oh yeah, did i already mention, make sure you make reservations? cool.	1
We have been going to Brio for lunches for over 3 years now.  it is our preferred place, but for the last three times it has not been good at all. Organization seems lost, servers are not tending to customers as they should and food services is slow and even forgotten at times.  We will not be going there anymore.  We don't feel the restaurant is keeping up with service and experience.  Two our of the last three times, the food was super late and cold and the waiter forgot our appetizers.Thanks, Odilia	0
Unpretentious, eclectic, delicious, cozy, romantic are only a few adjectives to describe this place. An excellent place to take a date! This place does not take reservations, so please plan accordingly. I arrived here a bit before 7, and there were plenty of tables to choose from. But by the time we left at 9, the place was mostly filled. This is a BYOB establishment, so bring your wine, but if you forget, dont worry, there is a wine shop right around the corner on Union. The cioppino was great, with fresh seafood, which included half a lobster, shrimps and mussels. We also had soft shell crabs, very yummy! Make sure to ask the waitstaff about suggestions, b/c some things they have may not be written on their &#34;wall menu.&#34; The creme caramel was OK, but nothing special. In any case, would def go back when in the mood for seafood!	1
Someone said its not worth standing in the heat. UMM YES IT IS!!!! I had the pulled pork. So dang good!!!	1
My wife and I were staying at the Viceroy two Saturdays ago and decided to take a walk by the hotel&#39;s scenic pool close to sunset. After our walk we saw the restaurant and decided to eat. We did not have any reservations and the restaurant was busy. The hostess was very sweet and found us a table for two indoors. I believe that it was the only one left. We were greeted by our waiter whose name is Romeo. We decided to eat tapas style and Romeo did a great job guiding us through the delicious menu. The food was great and Romeo really made our experience there a very good one as he was very friendly. In fact the entire staff was very courteous. Lol, I was even escorted to the men&#39;s room by one of the hostesses when I asked for its location. My wife and I will definitely return and also ask to sit at one of Romeo&#39;s tables.	1
I&#39;m a fan of Echo Park and English Pubs. Had to check this out.<br><br>Review is for the bar:<br><br>Pros: Cask Beer all day every day. Good service. Should be a great place to watch futbol games or catch a beer and a meal before walking up to Chavez Ravine, or rather to the now aptly named Short Stop that has $2 PBRs on game day.<br><br>Cons: Might not be a con for some, but it felt a bit more corporate than any pub I&#39;ve been to before. Staff all in Steven Alan style button ups with a business casual shift supervisor (I think) with walkie talkie roaming the floor. Just a whiff of Chili&#39;s-style friendly efficiency, not oppressive, but present. Prices do run high for beer, most $7-9. Hope they get a happy hour going soon<br><br>Planning to go back.	1
Very impressed. The Roof has gotten better and better over time. You simply can't beat the combination of Eric Greenspans food and the views The Roof offers. Cool little fire pit area as well...	1
Without a doubt - one of the most memorable meals I've had.	1
I have to drive down to Culver every couple months for work and the Wood is partly what makes the two hours of traffic worthwhile. I love this place&#39;s food! Whether it be for breakfast or lunch I have never been disappointed in the food. My personal favorite is the club sandwich with a mexican coke!<br><br>There usually isn&#39;t many waitresses on staff so service can be a little lacking but the food definitely makes up for it! I will be back again!	1
Without having been to the original location in Eagle Rock, I came here with a friend to see how their sandwiches stack up. Our order included the Oinkster Pastrami sandwich, the BBQ Pulled Pork (w/ Carolina sauce), an order of Piggy Fries, and a Horchata Milkshake (the shake of the month).Initial impression on the restaurant and food: great parking despite being in central Hollywood, friendly and helpful staff, and a clean diner-esque interior. We got the food soon after ordering and, though not huge, the sandwiches came packed with meat, making them more filling than first meets the eye.Both sandwiches were great. The meat is all prepared in house, the vegetables sliced to order (when applicable). Although toppings included red cabbage coleslaw, caramelized onions, and gruyere cheese, you taste the meat more than anything, with the toppings fulfilling more of a minor role. This is not a bad thing, because frankly the meat is terrific. The sauce however is crucial to balance and preventing the sandwich from becoming monotonous, which is also fine because the mustard served with the pastrami is bold and offers a beautiful counterpoint to the meat's peppery kick. The Carolina BBQ sauce, made with an acerbic vinegar (reminiscent of that used in wing sauce) similarly keeps the BBQ Pork interesting all the way down.I am not a huge eater of French fries, but their fries are done right, crisp exterior, potatoey interior. The Piggy Fries are topped with Thousand Island, caramelized onions, and shredded cheddar, meaning they are perfect for fry lovers, but not for the faint of heart.The milkshake was good, though the $6 (one-size only) price tag is questionable. Try sharing it. Milkshake enthusiasts are recommended to taste and judge.**Overall impression**: this is a solid meal for the price. Moreover, it's great to see classic American diner-style food done with a bit more class and attention than is traditionally the case. Also noteworthy is the Sandwich, Milkshake, and Cupcake of the Month rotation, which guarantees you can have a different experience each time you go, assuming you come once every month or so, which happens to be the exact frequency I foresee myself craving it.Recommendation - Start with the Oinkster Pastrami. If you come with 2 people, split 2 sandwiches to guarantee the meal is interesting until the end.	1
Favorite new place. I wish it was in my neighborhood so I could just hang at the bar every other day. Highly recommend starting at the bar. Fantastic drinks. Order from the list or just tell their masterful bartender what you like. You won&#39;t be disappointed. Such a good staff, too. It just feels great here...be friendly and be ready to have a great evening. I had the beef tendon puff, I wanted many more of these...then the raw asparagus salad, delicious, very well dressed &amp; tasty...and the Ricotta Gnocchi, Pea Greens, Hazelnuts, Pickled Ramps...had to go to the site to get the full description. Sooo good. Have to go back for dessert...was too full after the 3 courses. Have been back to the bar twice since this meal...with appointments elsewhere but had to come in for a drink. So worth it.	1
Had deluxe burger/fries/onions rings fries and burger were nothing special onion rings were quite good. What's all the hype I wonder?	1
Really cute and fun brazilian spot. The gorgeous ceiling makes for nice IG pics (for those so inclined.) The bands know their music and make the place even more exciting. Go on Fridays for Forro music. If you arent Brazilian, you better catch up. Most traditional Brazilian places are designed to attract their own people and get together to enjoy memories of home. If you happen upon a place, understand that Brazilians love to joke around, but they are super friendly provided you are actually trying. I&#39;ve learned conversational level of Brazilian styled Portuguese over the past two years JUST by being around them. You cant help but be immersed. Anyway, catch you here on the dance floor in the near future!	1
Blegh. I thought the burger bar phase of LA dining was over...I guess not. Not only did this wierdly-outfitted restaruant serve up one of the greasiest burgers i've ever had, but it replaced a better restaurant! Granted, the skinny fries and special ketchup was tasty, but it outshone the main course by far--a drippy, greasy mess that makes me long for in n out, crave a burger that isn't doused in grease then rolled in a deep fryer. I tried two burgers, the Umami burger, which would have been pretty good without the deep fried bun, and the triple pork burger--which tasted exactly like bacon bits. I ordered this because I love bacon. I HATE bacon bits--thus the blegh.pooh--I miss Cobras and Matadors.Oh, and the ice cream sandwich tasted like a low-fat frozen dessert that you might find at Albertsons (sorry Albertsons).Blegh.	0
I ordered the Pork Belly BLT. It is basically a normal BLT but instead replaced with Pork Bellt for the Bacon. IT WAS DELICIOUS. The Pork Belly was juicy and flavorful. I had it on a ciabatta roll and the bread the toasted to perfection. The bread and perfect amount of lettuce and tomato with a lot of pork belly all blended together perfectly with every bite. The chef puts this special glaze on the sandwich which was delicious.<br><br>The overall meal was great. The sandwich was $12 and came out to $13 after tax. It comes with a side of Popcorn that was served in a little steel pot and also came with a bite size piece of brownie for a dessert. All in all it was worth the $13 cause the sandwich alone was the best Ive had in a while.	1
I have to start out by saying that it is extremely difficult to find authentic Vietnamese food in New York; it makes sense because the population is very low (I&#39;m Vietnamese <br>and originally from out of state). I came here for dinner with a friend. <br><br>First off, the service was terrible! The waitress rushed us in and out. Now I understand that it was crowded and there was a massive wait line behind us, but it&#39;s not a pleasant experience to have a waitress walk by your table multiple times to give you mean stares as to hint you to hurry up. <br><br>Second, the food was average and very Americanized. I ordered the chicken pho which turned out to be a big let down in authenticity. Their chicken was grilled with lemon grass and let me tell you, chicken in real pho is never grilled or cooked with lemon grass (it&#39;s boiled in the broth). There was no taste to the broth that authentic pho has due to adding in certain essential spices (cinnamon and anise). I was also disappointed by the fact that they only gave me a tiny plate of bean sprouts and no basil (this is essential). <br><br>As for my friend&#39;s rice dish with grilled pork and veggies on top a bed of rice, that I had a taste of, it was decent. Not the best, but it was better than my pho.<br><br>All in all, if you want legit Vietnamese food, you&#39;re looking in the wrong place. But if you can settle for average, Americanized Vietnamese food for relatively cheap prices ($8-10 per entree), then this is your place.	0
Small and enjoyable place to enjoy tasty food or a delicious adult beverage. Currently enjoying the phenomenal Left Hand Nitro (milk stout). I give it a four instead of a five simply because their beer selection is good but not great. <br><br>Jason, a bartender, is great. Friendly, personable and accommodating. <br><br>I will be returning.	1
We stopped by while visiting little Tokyo. The ambiance made me feel welcomed and peaceful. The service was lacking maybe because we came early there were two guys in blue shirts running around. Cleaning on second and taking orders the next it was a bit confusing.Top 2 Food: The presentation is simple The quality and taste is amazing. Toro Sushi- So fatty! the most flavor I ever had with Toro. Spider Roll: It was delicate fresh veggies and the fried crab was so airy and non-greasy. simply delicious .	1
I guess i will never know what the food is like here. Seating a single person for breakfast in an empty resturant was WAY too complicated.	0
You can use this restaurant as a casual place to have lunch, or for a special occasion dinner--it's precise yet informal structure, furniture, and approach to service will take on your expectations and attitudes of the moment.  What remains constant, however, is the world-class performance in the kitchen.  Familiar dishes are modernized and perfected, using the classical techniques and modern imagination that characterize Daniel Boulud's work (at least, in the five of his restaurants I've tried.) An example is coq au vin--you may be expecting a poussin swimming in a copper stew pot, but you receive pieces of that bird that have been glazed with an intense, meat based sauce that, happily, stays with you all night.Not cheap, but not three-star-expensive either.  A significant addition to dining options in Boston.	1
Great warm, lively vibe with a menu full of lots of wonderful, interesting options - so nice not to see the usual mass productions, so often absent of creativity and care. There were perfect wine pairings - my syrah was seamless and our waiter really knew his food offerings in detail, listened, cared about what he was doing, and gave personal attention to upping our experience which otherwise so often seems absent in so many places. My guest and I chose to share a richly flavoured hot mushroom app, which we gave us both a bunch of mouth watering and livening tastes which aligned perfectly with the cold night outside. I then had the bouillabaisse and while I could taste the saffron and deep fish stock flavours, I found the portion rather small for a main (my guest agreed), especially at this time of year and the broth meager in volume, and a tad bit salty.  I was expecting a belly warming hearty indulgence and so while the flavours were all there, I just didn't get that comforting feed I had come to expect with a jump into the bouillabaisse pot.	1
The food is not good. The price is very high for this quality of food. Waited about 30 mins to get our food. Soup noodle was not cooked. Shame on you. Do not call this food Japanese.	0
Great food and great drinks. Hard to find parking but food and atmosphere is great. Bartender knows his drinks. Definitely go back for food and drinks.	1
Three awesome words, "Get the Mac-n-cheese".This is a great place for a dates, double-dates, and to re-establish conversations.A small menu, but mostly good.	1
Stopped here for a quick drink and appetizer. Our waiter was cute and friendly. When he couldn't describe the wine I was asking about he went and read the label, which was very helpful. The mushroom bruchetta was good, $7 for three pieces. The place was loud and semi-busy.	0
This was our favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. It was small and we were concerned about sitting out where pedestrians were walking, but it turned out to be so fun. We enjoyed all the people-watching. Our server was so enthusiastic about the food and the service was the best! The food was delicious and budget-friendly. Great restaurant!!!	1
I don&#39;t understand why they got five stars, I tried their kimchi bbq thing was very sour, others I just kept it all day on the table but no one touched it so I throwed them out. I tried one bite of cinnamon roll and I think is overpriced but I&#39;m not gonna try again even they lower the price.	0
Just tried the whiskey bar and although I was not a huge whiskey fan before my visit, I definitely am now! They made great drinks that I never would have known were made with whiskey. They had a great twist on the Moscow mule that left me a happy camper. <br><br>Also, tried the biscuit bites. To die for!<br><br>The bar is a little small in space but it&#39;s got a great dimly lit atmosphere.	1
Totally delicious! Had the Agnolotti with goat cheese and sheep&#39;s milk ricotta and hazelnut panko. I could eat it every day! Can&#39;t wait to go back and try some more dishes and their new cocktail menu.	1
Get the salmon tacos! Every time I come here I refuse to get anything else because I can&#39;t fathom anything better. I pair mine w spaghetti squash and a side of their Asian ginger sauce.	1
Long wait, food was weak. Even Ray Charles could see this meal was a fail.	0
It&#39;s been a while since I found a place with spectacular service and food. I&#39;ve seen this place in construction since my boyfriend lives a block away and we&#39;ve both been curious to see what restaurant will pop up. Thank goodness it&#39;s this one! We ordered the buffalo mozzarella, spaghetti, chicken in red wine and shallot sauce, and the apple crostini. Each item was fantastic! The staff were all very attentive, and I recall my boyfriend making a comment that he was trying to finish his glass of water but couldn&#39;t because they would refill it before it was even half full. Also, I am on a search for the best spaghetti in New York and this place would definitely make the top 3 (to note, I&#39;ve also had Scarpetta&#39;s and I personally think this place beats theirs). It was perfectly al dente and the fresh tomato and basil sauce was to die for. So when we were finishing up the meal, we heard a guy from the table next to us complain about the music saying that he can only hear the beats and not the melody. When the waiter apologized, the guy said &#34;this would be considered torture in some countries.&#34; I guess even with perfect food and service you&#39;re going to get whiners, which is probably why this place fell from five stars to four and a half. I hope this review helps get it back up to five!	1
Came in on a Sunday for the first time to try the food. Ordered the Curry Goat, literally waited 40 minutes before i got my food. The SERVICE is terrible..very slow!! The food was not good..it was missing more seasoning and flavors. The rice had no taste..the Mac and cheese very dry. The goat was average, not the best. The owner was a very nice lady very helpful and sweet however i wont be coming back.	0
Truly unimpressive Greek food.	0
Me and my buddies were kind of hesitant with these place considering that it is in one of the oldest hotels on the strip, the Riviera. However, Yelp helped us make the decision, and boy were we happy.<br><br>This is your classic and essential steakhouse, no fancy bull, just a good ol&#39; steak.<br><br>The bread is excellent, fresh baked.<br><br>I tried the french onion soup, solid. And then I had the 10oz filet mignon, ordered it medium rare and it was just perfect. The sides though could use a little tweaking, but you come here for steak not fillings.<br><br>All in all, it was a good experience and If ever we go back to Sin City, we will be paying a visit.	1
This is the worst restaurant experience in Williamsburg. We booked a table, and they had given it away when we got there (10 minutes late). They made us wait more than a hour before they gave us another table. The waitress was obnoxious. And the food... A friend of mine told me it was great, but no, it was actually unfit for human consumption.	0
A+ deli-style digs. I've frequented Canter's a few times and always leave fully satisfied having been craving some diner eats.They have full-menu counter service as well as a bakery to drool over (and hopefully take home some treats from) in their waiting area to be seated. On particularly nice days, I've come here anticipating to eat in, but end up getting a sandwich and gazillion cookies to go and sitting in Pan Pacific Park. The menu is GINORMOUS and has all the staples you might want (breakfast served all day, lox, pastrami, endless sandwich and salad options).They have a parking lot, but it's almost always full. Street parking is available in the neighborhoods nearby.Also, be sure to check out The Kibitz Room! Great little bar attached to the deli where you can bring counter service over and pair with a beer or cocktail. They have live music most nights and the vibe is chill-borders-on-divey.	1
These guys are a hidden gem. Excellent food, very friendly, knowledgable waiter without being overbearing. Local organic delicious fresh food. Only thing missing was ice cream for the apple crisp, which they said they were hard at work perfecting for a future release...	1
Absolutely love the food here! Anything that you order will be enough to feed a small army!<br><br>I&#39;ve tried a few different items like the empanadas(love them with their homemade sauce!), churrasco, milanesa de pollo(chicken Parmesan), and bandeja paisa while enjoying every bite. Granted, the churrasco isn&#39;t as good as any Nica establishment, but the service I&#39;ve received as of late and convenience of having it close to home make up for a little less salt(healthier too :-D). <br><br>All in all, I&#39;d highly recommend for a cheap and HUGE meal if you&#39;re in the area. Two can easily eat from one order regardless if what you get!	1
Neat decor. Especially good for dinner.	0
I live and work within one block of here, and frequently stop in. I really love their food, and always find myself getting breakfast burritos here....seriously S O good.<br><br>Nice little salsa bar too ;) <br><br>Keep it spicy xo	1
Food was better than expected considering you come for the drinks.  Have been a Sammy fan so it was nice tovisit his bar and cantina.	1
Everything about our experience at Gather was top-notch. The food was terrific, and well presented. Service was attentive and welcoming. Drinks were great. We sat at the kitchen counter, which was interesting. As we were out for a rare date night away from the baby, I probably wouldn&#39;t sit there again: seats were not too comfy and the heat and business of the kitchen were not the right fit for our night out--not Gather&#39;s fault, we chose the kitchen seats.	1
the pizza is just ok.<br>service is a bit slow.<br><br>service was weird everyone helps everybody - so you dont get a dedicated server they are all just running around trying to do everything which ends up being nothing.	0
Authentic Mexican restaurant with high quality , fresh ingredients from local farmers. Eric is very thoughtful and passionate about his restaurant. His recommendation scored high with me and my 10 year old girl. It's a fun, unpretentious place with a pool table and cool vibes. Really delicious food and creative menu. You should try the Asada Fries and get a taste of Heaven!	1
One of my favorite places in LA for breakfast all day long. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is the service is kinda hit or miss and the parking can be pretty rough. Food is always amazing though.	1
So sad, so disappointed... <br><br>After raving about Hot n&#39; Juicy to friends and family back home, I was so excited to come back and feast on the overly delectable shrimp/crawfish. My family decided to order to go since there was about 20 of us total and we didn&#39;t want to go to the restaurant. My aunt ordered about 200$ worth of shrimp/crawfish. When she got home I was ready! But to my dismay, the food was HORRIBLE. The shrimp was NOT fresh at all and fell apart when we peeled the skin off. It was like eating powder... the crawfish, I already knew that they weren&#39;t fresh and were frozen. But they were even better than the shrimp. I don&#39;t know what happened. It felt so surreal, I&#39;ve been to Hot n Juicy on several occasions before and I was very pleased. The shrimp were always plump and juicy. The crawfish was good as well. The only thing that&#39;s good about this place is that the sauce was good.<br><br>I&#39;m almost embarrassed to write this update because I told so many friends/family about this place. It was most of my family&#39;s first time experiencing cajun seafood and they were all dissatisfied. They didn&#39;t understand why I liked it so much. We had over half of our order left over. What a waste of money.	0
Bad service, they told us no dinner till 5 but were serving dinner to other guests. We decided to go but an automatic 25 % gratuity for poor service makes it a one star experience	0
I&#39;ve eaten the food here several times and was a huge fan of the amazing sandwiches and ice blended drinks here. This place would normally get a solid 5 star review from me, but heres why they &#34;generously&#34; got a 2 star only. My girlfriend ordered the &#34;California Turkey&#34; and I got the &#34;Complicated Order&#34; which both have turkey in it. We both got the ice blended chai as well. Then within about an hour later when we got home, we both started feeling nauseous and sick and showed signs of food poisoning... I mention also that I have a very strong stomach and don&#39;t normally ever get sick from food when other people who ate the same food has in the past. We aslo are not allergic to anything and Bronze Cafe was literally the only food we have had all day.<br><br>I called the cafe and wanted to just let them know we got sick from the food so they dont make anyone else sick because that would be awful. The young man who answered was very polite and said he would let the manager know. A few moments later surprisingly the manager called back and said they were going to check all the ingredients and was extremely apologitic and gave a full refund on the order ticket even though I didnt ask for it which was very nice of them. <br><br>I can see how maybe an ingredient that was &#34;off&#34; might of been served to us. As some of the staff look very young (some look younger than 15 years old) they probably werent trained on proper food preparation or have the attention to detail required to safely handle food? It&#39;s a shame really, because the sandwiches here are outstanding and delicious. <br><br>It&#39;ll take some time for us to have the courage to come back here and eat. Getting sick from eating out isnt a laughing matter and has to be taken seriously! Thankfully the manager handled it with us in a very professional and courteous manner.	0
I came here for dinner on a Saturday night with my parents. We were seated right away and served quickly. The wait staff was very nice and brought our orders quickly. They were out of a drink I wanted so the bartender came over and suggested similar drinks I might like. They have a very nice selection of custom cocktails that are all delicious. They even offered to make a custom drink for my mom because she couldn't quite decide what to get from the menu. The food was great and the desserts were rich and tasty! Definitely go here if you like treating yourself.	0
Wow..maybe I came on an off evening. This place has been on my Yelp NYC cheap eats bucket list for a year. Finally made it..<br><br>Great location.<br><br>Falafel sandwich was dryish cottony, almost cold and NO flavors popped (yes, I added the garlic, green sauce, tahini and hummus)...it was BLAH. I have eaten falafel at every highly rated place Mamouns, Maoz, Amsterdam Falafel DC, falafel in Detroit, SF, Boston, Providence etc etc...so I am no falafel noob.<br><br>I expect falafel to be HOT and popping with flavor.<br><br>The platter was better - the falafel balls were good...everything else was terrible. The hummus was salty and blah (where was the fresh popping flavor..no hit of lime / acid to brighten the flavor?), the garlic sauce was flavorless (or was it tahini..couldn&#39;t even tell), the taboule was decent. Something was overwhelmingly cuminly..I&#39;ve tasted better hummus, taboule and tahini from Whole foods and trader joes.<br><br>I once had falafel so bad that it&#39;s burned in my mind despite it being 10 years ago - it was in downtown NYC -Cindarella falafel. This is a close second. So many aspects of good falafel were misses here.<br><br>I am amazed at all these rave reviews. I&#39;d take Maoz over this any day and Mamouns too (the platter at the Hoboken location is AMAZING) especially given the premium price you pay here.	0
love the s-1 &amp; s-2 here. Cheap and very delicious. Their thai iced tea is very creamy and delish too!	1
Underwhelming.	0
Was at the bar for Sunday Brunch. 10 minutes wait to order, 30 minutes wait for a Cafe Americano, 50 minutes for Huevos Cubanos: Over easy eggs broken and hard flat-fried, served without a slice of bread!! Hard to imagine a more quick and dirty attempt at squeezing the hungover hipsters...	0
I ordered their chubby pork bowl and I dont know what all the hype was but the food was not good. I didnt even finish half the bowl and thats saying something.. <br>Service here is pretty fast and friendly. <br><br>Scale 1-10 1 not so good 10 awesomeness<br><br>Food 1<br>Service 10.	0
I was able to try various dishes but a couple jump out more than others which was the burger, deep fried grilled cheese and the fried cheese with maduro. They have a really diverse amount of beers and was surprise on how they make their own ice cream which was creamy and super tasty.<br><br>Looking forward to visit again!	1
Went for Valentine's Weekend and the entire meal was superb. Confession, I'm a steak and beer guy but trying to please my wife I made the reservations with an open mind. Steve, the server, professionally asked my preferences and guided me through Italian beer pairings with field greens and Short Rib &quot; al Borolo&quot; while my wife started with the house cured salumi followed by the black spaghetti with gulf shrimp. We split Tuscan Kale with ham hock as a side dish. The meal was incredible. If Italian food is your thing this place is a must eat place in Vegas. If you happen to be a husband just trying to please, this is a must eat place in Vegas you will enjoy.	1

Had a very nice dinner here with friends. I like the whole vibe of the place. Not only was the food good, the staff and the music they played all left us impressed. We had reservations for 630pm on a weeknight and were seated as soon as our whole group was accounted for. One thing I noticed right away is how cold the room was. Certainly made for ordering a hot pot or 2 for the meal. I also liked that the tables weren&#39;t too close to each other. So many restaurants these days try to pack it in and people are practically dining on top of each other. Good job Roy Choi!<br><br>We ordered 1 medium hot pot and it was the Jamaal Wilkes, an ode to #52 of the Los Angeles Lakers. This pot had silken tofu, clams, mussels, shrimp, kimchi, pork belly, scallion &amp; eggs. It was spicy but not too hot and had a lot of flavor. I liked it. I especially liked the pork belly, the mussels and clams. The egg is a must. Great dish... We also got the poke me which has yellow fin tuna poke, seaweed (sea beans) edamame, shoyu, sesame &amp; maui onions. Very good. Very tasty. We also got the roger wants more octopussy which is the baby octopus dish. I love octopus so I was all about this charred octopus dish. Yumm. Of course we got the kimchi fried rice and that was very good, as expected. We also got the uni dish called the beep beep. It was an uni dynamite rice bowl and I found it to be just ok. The sweet &amp; spicy rice cakes were delicious. Sort of like a dim sum type pan-fried flat cake. So good... The fried chicken wings aka wing chon gung fu were very good although a bit messy eating. Nothing wrong with getting your hands a little dirty for some tasty wings. Order it... We also got the bbq galbi which came on a sizzling plate. Nice and flavorful korean short rib with that familiar great sweet bbq marinade. <br><br>Service was great. The staff was really friendly... You even see some of them dancing to the classic hip hop that was being played inside the restaurant in their downtime. Drinks aplenty as you can order any of the drinks from the bar right outside and they will get it for you. The music they were playing was great. A lot of golden era hip hop like A Tribe Called Quest and Gangstarr to slow jams from Jodeci to other classics. I was really diggin it... Music is key and they did not drop the ball on that aspect.<br><br>Pot is a nice restaurant. Roy Choi has something brewing at The Line... I have to give him props. We actually saw him walk in with his daughter while we were in the lobby having after-dinner drinks and conversation. Eat at Pot.	1
Great addition to the neighborhood across the board! <br>Came at 5, started eating &amp; sippin tequila. Classy act... food is solid.. left at 9, barely coherent enough to hold a conversation with Cramer. Can&#39;t tell you the last time a restaurant gave a few complimentary beer backs. Great partnering of neighbors and businesspeople delivering the goods in this perfectly-appointment personal tribute to a city south of the border.	1
I heard great things and checked it out, but don&#39;t plan to go back.<br><br>The atmosphere was nice, though the lighting a little odd - dim, but not in a romantic or suave way. We were there later in the evening when it was absolutely empty, which could have changed the mood a bit.<br><br>The food was not memorable - extremely salty. I do recall that the seared tuna was completely bland to the point that none of the three people at the table ate more than one bite. The fish and chips were quite average; the winter salad rather plain; the veggie burger definitely nothing special. <br><br>Added to the above, the service was really not good and on an empty night, inexplicable. We had to get up and find the server whenever we needed anything - rather odd.<br><br>With all the tons of great food around, definitely skip it.	0
Obviously, this is a hugely popular place - and as far as diners go, Fred's is the best. They do great interpretations of classic foods and their staff is efficient and seem to possess a certain amount of wit. Meaning: they aren't always friendly, but get the job done. It's LA. While it's not exactly a date place, it has a great location to the movie theater. I've had many drunk-dining experiences here; and was never let down. Their breakfast sandwiches, chicken pot pie, mac 'n cheese balls, and Lucy Juicy burger are all winners. Sometimes the wait isn't worth it to sit inside, but inside is far better than their thisclose-to-the-street seating. Either way, it's a damn good diner!	1
The place is supo sed to close at 7:00pm but don&#39;t try to go there after 4 because there is nothing to eat plus a terrible service of the cashier	0
Found this place on the way home after shopping. Was craving curry and ended up getting the Chicken Cutlet dish as a suggestion. Portion was huuuuuge. I eat a lot... and I&#39;m stuffed. Chicken was really crispy and the curry had a perfect amount of spice. <br><br>Kitchen staff and waitress was super courteous and friendly. Very attentive and asked how my experience was. Glad I stopped by and will be back with friends! Best of luck to Isa.	1
Great good looking crowd. Nice beer selection, decent drinks. the door staff has always been nice, which is great to see in a place so &#34;hot&#34;. Great vibe and ambiance all around....views amazing but can get crowded.	1
We love this place!!! You will find us here every Sunday for Brunch;)	1
So apparently this is the "it" place to be. My friend and I came here for dinner on a random Wednesday night; the place was packed, but only waited for about 15 minutes. We spotted a lot of celebrities, which is always fun. Jon Hamm was eating a few tables away from us, and we couldn't stop gawking at him. Any who, the food was delicious. I got the meatloaf sandwich, which was very hearty and flavorful. We started with the cheese platter, which was good, but a little boring. The potatoes that came with my sandwich were probably my favorite part of the whole meal. The ambiance of the place was super romantic. Can't wait to come back here.	1
I love this place so much that I catch myself leaving early to stop there before I head to work. And the prices are almost as good as those tasty little fresh baked treats they have out every day. Definitely my favorite spot down the block!	1
We had a large party of 15. One of our memebers didn't get her order taken 3x yet the portions were large enough for us to share . Despite that Steve our server was great as usual. The kitchen needs work though. 3 orders had to go back due to flavors were not to par .	1
Love Paseo's! I am sad I have an allergy now to gluten and no longer eat the sandwiches which I crave there. Please make a gluten free bread option.	1
The food here is terrible. I have to agree with the other reviewers here that the sisig is very dry and hardly any meat on it. The beef steak has a very strong citrusy flavor (in a bad way). I was very disappointed with the quality of their food.	0
Lovely little experience here. Sat outside with my husband and our dog and enjoyed a beautiful LA morning. The huckleberry donut was amazing! I could have eaten 10 of them! Also tried the yogurt parfait (pretty standard but tasty and good) and a bite of the breakfast sandwich (which was really yummy!).	1
i've given umami so many chances. the truffle burger made me do it. until it came with ground up bones in it. disgusting!	0
Tastes just like New York's BonChon! Nice to have one on the west coast. I ordered both soy garlic and hot and spicy for my mom. Soy garlic is always good and oh so crunchy. Packaging is really cute here too.	1
Compared to week nights vs weekends Paul's Club almost seems like two different bars. The week nights Paul's Club presents itself as a nice quieter bar for drinks and conversation. On the weekends, especially later in the evening (i.e. after 10pm) Paul's Club tends to be a nice bar but chances for a conversation are hit or miss, as it gets very crowded and very loud. Reasons to go anyways: perhaps you'll get a seat and the beer selection is wonderful. Also they tend to mix some strong effing drinks, and obnoxious frat dudes are sparse. Paul's Club always has this unusual smell, it smells like a swimming pool. My vote is that it is some chemical to sanitize their carpets. (Yes, a carpeted bar.. eeh) However if you find yourself bored at Paul's Club you and your drinking buddies can speculate what exactly that smell is. Also if you are a beer person, Paul's Club is one of the few bars in Madison that serves snake bites, which is a lovely pint glass with 1/2 Guinness and 1/2 Hard Cider. It's quite tasty	1
Always liked Carribbean food and hadn&#39;t yet tried Haitian. After the many awful experiences I&#39;d had at the nearby Subway shop (see review) it was time for a change. Tried &#34;Legumes&#34;: stewed eggplant, beef,&amp; cabbage with rice&amp; beans and green salad as sides. Delicious and homemade tasting. A bit overpriced for what I got but that&#39;s what happens when surrounding eateries are able to take advantage of nearby workers who have very limited time and options.	1
Awesome place. Though on the spicy side but best and authentic briyani near USC.. Good for non vegetarian food... Everything has been awesome till date here.. And so cheap...	1
so... after hearing about this place for about 4 years, I finally went with my co-workers. couldn&#39;t have been more disappointed. I asked for a margarita and the response i got was, and im quoting here: &#34;I am not much of a bartender, sorry&#34; mind you, a. its lunch on Friday b. there were other servers on the staff!!! WTF, you have it on the menu.<br>anyway, moving aside from my alcohol-deprived moment. the food was mediocre at best.	0
It was a Tuesday afternoon and I was on what seemed to be the verge of starvation, so naturally I Yelp&#39;ed the closest, 5 star burger joint and dragged my hard-to-please mother-in-law with me!<br><br>Upon arrival, we were greeted by both an empty room and a friendly cashier. Their prices are pretty standard, ranging from ~$6+ for a burger, and ~$1.50+ sides of fries. <br><br>Their menu seemed to be nonexistent, which was weird to me because places that only make burgers usually have an extensive selection of specialty burgers. Their options were a regular burger, a viva burger, a bleu cheese burger, turkey burger, veggie burger, a California burger (just has avocado) and there might have been one more but nothing memorable. The differences between the burgers were basic add-ons like onions, pickles, or bacon. There side options were fries, truffle fries, loaded fries, and cheese fries.<br><br>I ordered a regular burger with cheese, truffle fries, and cheese fries. Everything was out in about 10 minutes. By this time, my mouth was watering with excitement and I could barely contain myself. Unfortunately, I was incredibly disappointed. The burger bun was a normal size, but the actual burger patty was so tiny that I had to lift up the leaf of lettuce to make sure it was there. I couldn&#39;t believe it. $10 for a burger and 2 sides of fries is a standard price for a regular size burger but this burger was smaller than the 99c cheeseburgers at McDonalds. <br><br>As far as taste goes, it was okay. I have made myself better burgers at home that didn&#39;t require me drenching them in ketchup to enjoy like I had to do to this one. However, that was probably due to the fact that I was basically just eating bread.<br><br>The truffle fries tasted just like the cheese fries minus the cheese. They were a little thicker than shoe-string fries and according to my MIL, undercooked. Like another reviewer mentioned, the cheese was like movie-theatre nacho-cheese which is great on crunchy nachos but not so nice on thin, soft french fries.<br><br>Upon finishing my meal, I felt pretty cheated by my Yelp family but when I went back to double check that I had gone to the right 5-star burger place, I realized that out of the 2 reviewers, one hadn&#39;t even ordered a burger. I guess this was my mistake.<br><br>Next time I am craving a burger, I&#39;ll make sure to check out some place with a greater variety, quantity, and quality of burger. I really wanted to love this little mom-and-pop shop but unfortunately, Viva Burger just didn&#39;t cut it for me.	0
I called ahead for a 9pm reservation. Upon arriving, I was somewhat apprehensive to eat here because of the &#34;B&#34; health department grade, but that didn&#39;t matter since they no longer had my reservation. I do not recommend this place.	0
I hate to rain on the parade here, but Xixa is as overrated as they come. From the moment I sat down at the bar and was attacked with hyper-friendliness by the bartender (w/ faux interest and a lazy smile: &#34;Is this your first time dining at Xixa?!&#34;), I knew I was in for a blah experience. <br><br>Before ordering, the bartender suggested we get at least 4 of the small dishes and one of the &#34;family&#34; style large dishes. (Slow down, girl!) We opted to start with three small dishes and then go from there. Suffice to say, we stopped after eating the following:<br><br>Shrimp tostada: flavorless and uninspired. <br>Fried oysters: Way too much breading. <br>Carnitas: good, but far from transcendent.<br><br>Three tapas-sized dishes, one very small shot of tequila and two bad beers, and we walked out still hungry, unhappy, and down 70+ bucks. Weak. It&#39;s not the portion size that matters, of course. We knew what we were getting into. It&#39;s that the flavors just weren&#39;t there. There was no love put into this food, and that&#39;s what you should be getting at these prices.<br><br>One final note to the staff: Customers can tell when you&#39;re being insincere. A good server will be attentive without needing to hover. The forced friendliness is unnecessary and won&#39;t make me forget about the subpar food I&#39;m being served.	0
The Pink Door is such a great restaurant!	0
I&#39;ve had fish and the al pastor tacos there twice now. They are delicious! Large, stuffed full of amazing and savory fresh veggies, it&#39;s become hard for me to order anything else because they were so good. Also irresistibly good ... the cucumber and chia seed agua fresca. I&#39;m pretty sure this is the ultimate summer drink. <br><br>The folks staffing the counter were young and super thoughtful (apologizing for the lack of online ordering - heads up - the online ordering function on their website might seem operational, but it&#39;s not).<br><br>Don&#39;t come here for the atmosphere, but if you want fresh and well prepared food I recommend!	1
Service was extremely slow.  It was not busy, but it took forever to receive our drink order, forever to receive appetizers and even more to receive our entrees.  The food was good and a good value.	1
I love this AYCE KBBQ joint! It is so great in so many ways! Whenever my friends and I come here we get the $17.99 menu option which has so many choices of meat! In addition to the meat they have dongchimi gooksoo (cold noodles), gyeran jjim (steamed egg), and doshirak (lunchbox with rice, kimchi, and egg). And everything is AYCE! <br><br>The side dishes here are pretty good...they even have ddukbokki (spicy rice cakes). But make sure you don&#39;t fill up on that so you can eat your money&#39;s worth in meat! All the meat on the menu is really good for an all you can eat place. <br><br>The service here is great as well! They come by to change your grill in between every 2-3 plates of meat which is awesome since the meat never gets burned. They do get busy here during dinner time so if you have a big party, make sure to make a reservation! <br><br>Parking lot is valet parking only but it&#39;s really not hard to find street parking around the area. <br><br>The sole complaint I have about this place is that they don&#39;t have SALAD which is a very important part of the AYCE experience in my opinion...but I suppose they make up for it with the variety of other foods they have on their menu. <br><br>Make sure you check in when you go! They sometimes offer free drinks and what not (:	1
I came here over the weekend and quickly made the decision not to come back. It&#39;s a hole in the wall diner that&#39;s been around since the 30&#39;s. Yes, it has it&#39;s charm for giving off that old time diner vibe, but the quality of food makes me never want to come back.<br><br>I ordered the French toast + eggs &amp; the home fries dish. The French toast was awful in appearance. On one side, it was completely burnt and the other... Soggy!! Ew. Without syrup, all I could taste was the burnt. After one toast down, I opted to eat the eggs. I asked for it over easy, however, they were wayyy too easy! And I&#39;m not sure how someone could mess up eggs, but they did. Another strike. Finally, I had hoped the home fries would save the meal, instead, they tasted bland and came at room temperature.<br><br>If only I had realized the dates on the positive reviews, it would have saved me from wasting my favorite meal of the day at this place.	0
I have NO idea how this place is rated as high as it is, with as many reviews. Have you people ever had real Mediterranean food? <br><br>Story of my life: I was trolling Yelp looking for a lunch spot, and I had come across Ta-eem Grill (as I had so many other times), and decided to give it a shot. I was very excited to try another place in LA, but as always was extremely disappointed from the first bite on. <br><br>The food just lacked flavor, plain and simple. I got the chicken shawarma plate and while it was a lot of food, it wasn&#39;t anything I wanted to eat. The chicken looked like it was poor quality, and didn&#39;t have much flavor to it. There was oil just lingering at the bottom of the to go container too....The hummus was okay, I&#39;ve certainly had way better, but it lacked overall flavor. The salads it came with were also really bland, and some tasted like they were canned, not fresh. Some of them even had an Indian/curry flavor, which I found very odd. <br><br>Sucks because I really wanted to like Ta-eem grill. The people working there were all friendly, but unfortunately their food was not good and I will not come back.	0
Minimal vegetarian options. Indifferent service but worst of all we both fell ill after a brunch here - so watch out.	0
Excellent casual, fun dining experience! Located right in Harvard Square. Across from the T-Station entrance. Large dining and pub environment. Menu is a very nice mix of interesting choices. Very reasonably priced. Excellent presentation and quality. Plus every nite there is live music. Noise level very manageable and still allows for dinner conversation without being drowned out. Crowd is mixed. Something for everyone,  though young children might be challenged.  Just my opinion. Music starts at  8PM and that's when I'd recommend making reservations!I would highly recommend this restaurant to a friend and would definitely go back again!	1
I highly recommend Andrea's, especially sicne its name doesnt do justice to the quality of food, service, upbeat bar scene, quality and deep wine list...Great experience the several times I have gone to this Encore Hotel, solid restaurant.	1
The seitan hash and eggs will make you question your carnivorous habits. Tasty scones for the road as well. Good luck getting a table before Jerry yells out your name with your order up.	0
Best meal of my life. I want to go back but I know reservations will be near impossible to get.	1
It lives up to the hype!	1
Stopped in on a whim and was very happy I did. The food selection is great and preperations are on point, not to mention an amazing beer selection. If you any where near 180 you need to get a 50/50 burger it&#39;s bordering on a religious experience.	1
Fantastic food and service provided by Sarah was the highlight at our visit at the Baltimore Museum of Art. A true foodie hotspot with farm to table ingredients and a great twist on many classics for brunch. Popular midday on the weekends, clearly this is a neighborhood favorite.We had made reservations with Open Table and were happy that we did so. Saved time waiting for a table. The museum is wonderful as well, free for visitors. Do note that the museum is not open at the beginning of the week. Also, if you have leftovers, you're not allowed to carry it through the exhibits.Parking was on the street with us. Quarters helped pay the meter.	0
I was so hopeful based on the reviews. I ordered delivery. It took 2 hrs. The delivery man was so unprofessional. He basically threw the bag at me was like "you order something?" while he began to very inappropriately interact with my neighbor. The food was passable (except why they put fries in the same container with a burger when you know it is going to be soggy is so stupid), but the overall experience was awful.	0
Excellent food! Ended up eating everything because it was so good. Service was phenomenal. One of the best waitress's I have ever had.	1
Ask the bartender Sky to make you the stop lights: Green - Straight shot of tequila Yellow- Tequila SourRed- Hot Bloody Mary	1
Fast too for to go orders. Love all of the salads and souvlaki. Bring cash.	1
I hadn&#39;t been to JNJ in a while, and decided to make the trip this morning. Remembered the insane Sunday morning lines and got there right when it opened (actually 20min earlier just to be safe). I need up being the third group seated. Success!<br><br>The place was completely empty, obviously. Yet somehow I still ended up being seated in the corner by the back door and the toilets. Seriously? Every table was free. <br><br>So I ask to switch tables and from there it was game over. The hostess and waitresses (all suffering from RBF by the way and lazily dressed in yoga pants) were incredibly cold and rude. The contrast between how they served other tables and mine was baffling. Nearly nonexistent service even though the place was empty and there were twice as many waiters as patrons. <br><br>The food... was okay. The loaded hash brown was delicious, but the burger was cold and the breakfast burrito was atrocious. Awesome food at JNJ was the only reason I put up with the long waits and terrible service. Without even that, I think I&#39;ll pass on JNJ in the future.	0
Had a great night here while in Las Vegas for the weekend.  The wine list is very good, and while there are some pricey wines available, we were able to find some very good value.  Food as always was very good	1
La cafe is somewhere you go because it is the only place open. Over priced and quality is inconsistent. I usually get the trucker sandwich and the amount of meat varies greatly between decent to one slice. The breakfast sandwiches and paninis are really greasy, beware!	0
Came here earlier this week, on December 15, a Thursday night, to celebrate my friend&#39;s birthday with a group of about 15 people.<br><br>The host that attended to us was nice enough, and had a table ready for us pretty quickly. The waiter (Frank was his name, I believe), introduced himself, and I said that I would wait to order when everyone else came. <br><br>After our group came together, it took about 30 minutes to get a couple glasses of water. Not everyone received a glass of water, so a few of us ended up sharing since the waiter would not check up on us on a regular basis. Some of us that ordered bar drinks received their drinks quicker than we got water. That&#39;s ridiculous.<br><br>Food service was spotty. Dishes were not coming out at the same time, which I forgave since we were a large group. After about 45 minutes though, I gave up. Took a while to flag down the waiter (about three attempts to get his attention), and when I finally got his attention, I asked him to cancel my order. He walked away, then came back, announced that I never placed an order and walked away again. Excuse me? <br><br>My friends look at me. They all witnessed the ordering of a prosciutto pizza earlier, and I am obviously pissed.<br><br>Maybe he forgot my order because I ordered a pizza and not a martini? Obviously the place is packed and it has a &#34;lounge/club&#34; atmosphere at this time, but the kitchen is still open, and we have a WAITER, not a cocktail server.<br><br>The beginnings of a fireworks display commences and the waiter notices my colorful language. He comes back less than five minutes later, and apologizes. In turn, I let him know that his unprofessional and rude attitude, as well as his overall lack of service skills did not give our group a pleasant experience, and that this encounter did not warrant a return visit from any of us.<br><br>In addition, I understand that some establishments would wish to have a dress code. But I&#39;m sorry, Segafredo, we are not in Miami Beach, your service is terrible, and there is nothing to look at but an empty lot across the street. <br><br>I also noticed that this place was celebrating its four-year anniversary. Wow.<br>I honestly do not think that service could have been any worse than it was, and seriously - if you are celebrating how long you&#39;ve been in business, you better make sure that your service is top-notch. <br><br>The decor and music was honestly the nicest thing about this place. Might have been a decent place to grab a couple drinks, but there are much nicer places to visit, and this experience left a bad taste in my mouth - never again!!	0
My friend and I stopped by for Sunday brunch. It was busy but we were seated quickly which was nice.<br><br>I ordered a coffee and they had ALMOND milk which I haven&#39;t been able to find anywhere else. Kudos!<br><br>We had the plate of meat with some different pickles, eggs pickled in beet juice with pate, and random yumminess and a salad to start. We ordered the ricotta pancakes and pork belly in grits for our mains. The food was great! I already love ricotta pancakes but these came with a rhubarb jam which I never had before but really made them stand out. The pork belly and grits were delicious as well. The pork belly still had some of the fat on it and it just melted in your mouth. <br><br>I think this place is new so it&#39;s great that the place fits the area and food is awesome. I will def be going back for dinner.	1
By far the worst burger ive ever had in my life!!!! It was unclean. And cooks worked with no gloves.coughing all over the place.	0
Everything was good, starting from the drinks made by the bartender. food and buffet good.  The only thing missing for a Brazilian Steakhouse are the organs: no kidney, no heart, no liver ..... a bit disappointed but overall good.Special thanks to Matthew who was very professional and detail oriented. And I know what I'm talking about, I'm myself waiter in a high end Steakhouse. He speaks a good French which made it even better since I am French.	1
Go go !!! Sunday Brunch!! Yes Yes... So many other places... long long waits. This sweet place breeze in. Excellent service. Great Eggs Benny their style -3 different ways. Bacon to die for. Do not forget an extra side of it. Yum.	1
The reason propale line up around the block is because of the name, location, and cool vibe of the environment: not the food.<br><br>I accidentally ordered the strange potatoe/egg combination. It was fine. However, I found a hair in it. <br><br>The manager was kind enough to replace this with a sandwich. I was so excited for trying out the breakfast sandwich!<br><br>The sandwich was mediocre at best.	0
I love the fish burrito with added chipotle sauce, side of red sauce, and a grilled jalapeno. My others favs include the asada torta and the mighty asada nachos.	1
Always lively and plenty of food.  A couple would probably be overwhelmed by the amount of food.  Should go with a group of four of more.  Beware of specials.  We took advantage of the 4 (dishes) for $40, but ordered 2 extra meatballs.  The 2 meatballs were $12.00!!!!	1
I am NOT a restaurant! I AM A CAFETERIA!!!!	1
Am I seriously review #834 for Canter's? Fine, short and sweet . . .This place is magic and if I could I would marry it. Even the briney smell of the beef and pickles makes my toes tingle with joy. WHERE ELSE DOES CANTER'S MAGIC HAPPEN, PEOPLE? Show me a huge 24-hour Jewish deli, with an attached bar and the most delicious chocolate-chip cheesecake, with upwards of four kinds of mustard and YES THE MOST DELICIOUS REUBEN EVER, where I also happen to run into celebrities (okay, they average C-list, but hey, that's so LA). I know it's expensive and the service is hit-or-miss (I prefer the term "charmingly casual"), and that the place is probably overrated due to its, um, LEGENDARY status. But nothing on Earth will ever change my mind about it!	1
This place is pretty good! I had the Asada fries. They were so good and the meat had such a good flavor. I also tried a fish taco that was ok I rather have had an Asada taco. There micheladas are really good too!! I love how the place really looks like taco truck looks pretty cool lol if you go late just know that there&#39;s a club rite next door so it gets packed. Can&#39;t wait to go back and try something new!	1
Great brunch spot! Definitely recommend any of their homemade sodas - I tried the tangerine soda - it&#39;s pure tangerine pure and sparkling water - amazing! <br><br>We had the berry bowl with yogurt (pretty standard, but it&#39;s hard to mess up fresh berries and plain yogurt), then for entrees tried the crabcakes and the bread pudding French toast. Both were incredible and a nice mix of sweet and savory. The crabcakes are served warm with hollandaise on top of yummy greens with a subtle but delicious vinaigrette. The French toast was definitely a heavy, rich meal, topped with baked pears and pomegranate seeds - perfect accompaniments. The French toast is awesome as an entree but would be the best when shared by 2-5 people as a sweet end or share plate to more savory brunch meals (in my opinion).<br><br>Service was fantastic with coffee constantly refilled, server checking on us just the right amount, and not too busy or rushed. Will definitely be back!	1
If you are looking for real mexican food (NOT FRESH MEX) this place beats a trip to homestead. The service is quick and friendly.	1
Our waiter, Anthony, was passionate about his restaurant and it's food.  He offered many suggestions for food pairings, food sharings and how to enjoy every aspect of our meal.  This restaurant is truly a foodie's dream.  Excellent portions--not too large or small--perfect sizes and amazing service.  Definitely dine there if you visit Vegas.  I will certainly be back and can't wait to recommend it to my friends.	1
I celebrated my birthday here last week and had alot of fun. They were able to accomodate my ever growing guest list and the server was very patient. The tapas are great for sharing and the guacamole and home made chips are a meal in themselves! Lots of Spanish and South American wines to pair nicely with all dishes. Will go back again and again.	1
I am sold! I came in for a quick drink and really enjoyed the cocktail options. The drink concoctions are simple and hits the spot if you are looking for something easy. Ordered the Lemon Raspberry Panache and loveeeed the raspberry additions. The drink consist of a blend of pilsner and lemonade with a mix of smashed and whole raspberries. I am not sure of the ratio, but the hint of sweetness whether from the lemonade or raspberries was ideal. A very fun drink on a cool summer night.	1
We first went to blue ribbon in NYC and it was superb, very fresh and a fantastic place, so when I took my wife to Vegas for her 30th and saw there was one there I decided to take her there and it was just as good as we remembered! Definitely worth a visit especially if your into your sushi.	1
I was in Seattle for a family wedding, and a large group of us had brunch and dinner at Lola. It was ridiculously good. I would highly recommend this place. Food was incredible. They serve a lot of really creative and delicious originals, like octopus hash, as well as delightful variations on classic mediterranean fare. The service was also very professional and attentive. I would love to go again and try out some of the other skewers of seasoned mammal flesh.	0
I live like 5-10 minutes walking distance from here, depending on how hungover I am :-D.<br><br>My 5 star review is simply for the Chicken Chow salad. Like girls that I would actually take out on dates, I have high standards for my salads!<br><br>The climax on these salads are worth the costs, lol. I get goat cheese instead of Feta and add light sundried tomatoes. Incredible!<br><br>P	1
Perhaps I&#39;ll return someday.<br><br>I&#39;ll echo others and say the drinks are good. I had a St. Charles (I think, first drink on their menu). I am decidedly NOT a gin fan, and the drink was really, really good. I sampled other drinks my friends got, all of which were good.<br><br>This may have been a 4 star review, had we not waited 45 fucking minutes for our drinks. No joke, read that again. We waited in line for about 15 minutes to get in, and once we got in, I noticed the bar was busy, but not packed by any means at all. Read my Whistler review for more context; if you&#39;re going to be that kinda cocktail bar, be the Violet Hour, and don&#39;t let anyone stand around. The minute you do that, your bouncer looks like an idiot keeping people out, when the inside is nowhere near packed. <br><br>We were able to find a table fairly quickly. The crowd was an odd mixture of the 9th circle of hipster hell combined with people from Lakeview looking at the next big thing, w a dash of Schaumbergers who probably found the wait at the VH too long.<br><br>First, there was &#34;A 15 minute delay on drinks.&#34; &#34;Sorrrrryyyyy&#34; was all our server had to say. I get you&#39;ve only been open a few weeks. HIRE ANOTHER BARTENDER. So fifteen minutes goes by. We wait. No drinks. 30 minutes goes by, someone in our party orders food, it comes out ten minutes later. Our server stops by our table to apologize, again.<br><br>After forty five minutes, she comes over and tells us: &#34;Jeez I&#39;m sorry, but the bartender just made a huge shaker of a few kinds of drinks, that&#39;s why it took so long, they&#39;ll be right out!&#34; Five more minutes goes by, we get our drinks, drink them, demand they be comped, and leave.<br><br>I&#39;m willing to chock half of that up to the fact that Scofflaw is still going through some growing pains, but I can&#39;t say I have any desire to go back. Our server was a total moron, and the manager was a dickhead. CHECK PLEASE.	0
Sorry to disagree with the great reviews but we found the tapas here to just be okay--good variety but some things were underseasoned and 1 dimensional whereas others were just WAY too salty. Add to that the indifferent and somewhat unfriendly hostesses, and the over 1 hour wait stranded here waiting for a taxi to take us home (which the staff were entirely unhelpful about) and I would simply NOT recommend going out of your way to this place. Thumbs down!	0
Quite the let down. The drinks weren&#39;t anything to be amazed by (prepared by a mixologist supposedly). Food was ok, appetizer portions were tiny. <br><br>When we arrived the service was phenomenal but as soon as the tables filled up it went in to everyone running around mode. Party of six took over three hours to eat and pay bill because of delays in kitchen and with bill. <br><br>Wont return.	0
dark chocolate mocha and raspberry lime are yummy..Burger is ok but i end up taking another almond croissant home.	1
Smoothie was great. Turkey burger was great. Service was pretty good. It's nice and clean and organized. Lots of tasty options on the menu. French fries are amazing! With this garlic aioli on the side.... So good! Can't wait to go back. Inexpensive, sort of healthy, pretty quick, and convenient. Go!	1
Really, really, really bad service. Sorta bad food.	0
A good place to go after taking some pictures of the Brooklyn Bridge. Pros: good food, nice ambiance, great location. Cons: service struggled hardcore. I mean real hardcore. We were asking for forks and water and napkins and refills and the check like it was our last wish and the genie was in a no bullshit mood. Genie why so harsh? All I want is the check to pay you back. Nope.	0
Pho-fo-sho! Noob to Pho. Had beef stew it was awesome! Great combo of flavors. Great price! Give it a try!	1
The coffee was great. The service was horrible. Took 45 minutes for a simple breakfast for 4 people, we had to leave before they brought the order because they took so long. This restaurant DOES NOT know what French toast is, they brought toasted French bread. Not sure how they got this wrong. TWICE. Wouldn&#39;t recommend. Not coming back again.	0
This place is decorated very strangely. It appears like the designer couldn't make up about decorating choices. The aim is either the interior of a museum cafe or executive waiting lounge at a transit station. The restaurant features a full scale bar, but again the lighting suggests that the space has been re-purposed and has thrown in a bar because coincidentally the restaurant has a liquor license. The bar is fine if you're comfortable imbibing under unflattering lights, but it's definitely never going to be a place to drink for any length of time. While most of the food is great, and the quality of the burger meat is great, the prices trend towards the high side, and I'm not a fan of the fries. They come out super thin and very fried, reminding me of French's potato sticks. They're more potato chips than fries. And the chili isn't particularly well done. All those negatives aside, the burgers were delicious and the staff friendly and helpful in allowing access to the wifi signal. Parking can be a bear if you're coming mid-day off street parking is available, but it will be a 1-2 block walk. The concept is inventive, make your own/designer burger, it's been repeated elsewhere with similar success, but this location exemplifies how, why and why not it works.	1
The Roof on Wilshire! What's there to say?... except this place is wonderful! Having recently moved back from downtown Chicago, I was having skyline withdrawals coming back to sprawled-out LA. Chicagoans love their rooftop bars and treasure them since... well, you can only be outside between the months of June and September. I wish I were kidding... The best thing about LA (and to offset my skyline withdrawals) is the weather and the "scene." Despite this being an upscale bar in a cute boutique hotel in a prime area, the Roof on Wilshire was wonderfully not pretentious. It was relaxed, the crowd was not full of posers and scenesters, the drinks were reasonably priced, the service was good (not great... somewhat slow...), and the view was great. Best of all: valet parking was incredibly affordable! I loved the cabanas, the pool was beautifully lit, the step-down seating area overlooking LA was a great "big group" area, and the heaters kept us warm in the (SoCal) "cold." A nice alternative to some of the other overrated rooftop bars around LA. Definitely coming back!	1
Who knew fried pickles were a German treat? Ok ok so I've never been to Germany but I am from the South where everything and anything that can be deep fried will be so it's refreshing to see other countries do it as well.	1
Three dollar beers all day every day!!Okay, maybe beer isn't your cup of tea, but if you like Stellas or Hoegaardens, well stop by for a mug of decently priced ale. But it doesn't end there. I have yet to sample the breakfast menu, but if it is as delicious as the lunch menu, then I wouldn't be surprised. With the comfortable decor and great music as a backdrop, The Hollywood Corner offers an easy dining option from burgers to sandwiches to salads. I recommend the chicken chili (yum!) and the Santa Fe Salad, although the last person I ate here with had the Bacon Lettuce Avocado Tomato a few times and said it's fabulous. The staff is incredibly attentive and accomodating - with immediate refills and flexibility when it comes to requests (aka splitting checks a million ways, making room for a large party easily). What a great find!	1
This is my third visit. Always good with fast, helpful service. Varied ethnicity of clientele make for an international feel. For me, that enhances the experience. Now closed as it is being relocated to another building.	0
This PF Chang&#39;s is located in Dolphin Mall- already we&#39;re off to a bad start.<br>After a morning at the Cool-de-Sac with our kids, a group of my mommy friends and I decided to head over to PF Chang&#39;s for lunch. When we walked in, the restaurant was nearly empty. There was no one seated in the center section. My friend told the hostess it was 8 adults and 5 strollers. Our kids had all bed fed and were sleeping in their strollers at this point.<br>She told us to wait...even though the restaurant was empty.<br>Several people in parties of 2 and 3 started walking in and were seated immediately. 11 parties to be exact. My friend counted. We continued to wait.<br>After over 20 minutes we were seated at a table set up by a total idiot who has never in his/her life seen a stroller or the contents of a stroller. We were expected to put some of our strollers over by a wall. Really, assface? You want me to leave my child over by some wall in a restaurant located in Dolphin Mall of all places? Guess what&#39;s never going to happen...yeah...that.<br>When the manager asked if I could move my stroller so that no one bumped into it, I pointed out that we were given a table that had been set up in the dumbest way possible to accommodate strollers.<br>The service was pretty damn slow, but the food was good.<br>I asked my waitress to refill my glass of water twice. I got up to go to the bathroom and when I came back, my glass was gone. I waited about 10 minutes and asked for water again. Five minutes later, still no water. So I asked the manager and he finally brought it to me.<br>Here&#39;s the thing...<br>We were a group of moms having lunch on a Wednesday afternoon. <br>A few things should be obvious to the staff: <br>1. We don&#39;t work.<br>2. We have the time and expendable income to lunch with our friends.<br>3. We also go out to dinner with our husbands on the weekends a lot.<br>Guess where my husband and I aren&#39;t ever going for dinner?	0
Went with the wifey on sat night food was ehh..had good saisons but the highlight of the night were the crispy brussel sprouts..i had the smoked salmon bruscheta witch was ok..but finished the night with the bread pudding paired with a belgian quadrupel..well be back.	1
I&#39;m a little afraid to write this review. With all the 4- and 5-star reviews, how can I give Los Tacos only a 2-star review? Well....<br><br>The tortilla is thin. It ripped once I picked it up. The meat is dry - both the adobada (pork) and pollo asado (chicken). The flavor is a little underwhelming and the texture is inconsistent. Some pieces were meaty and some pieces were a little like jerky. <br><br>Understandably, I went at 8pm during a 9pm closing day. Perhaps because it was near closing time, the food wasn&#39;t the same caliber as it would be during the lunch and dinner rush. But an establishment shouldn&#39;t let that affect the quality of the food. <br><br>For a spot that boasts to be No. 1, they sure didn&#39;t serve No. 1 food.	0
We were at The Roof recently, which is usually a nice place, but the last time we were there it was very unprofessional and lacked class. We were ignored by both the bartender and host, followed by the management, who instructed the employees to take the chaise lounge chairs away while customers were relaxing in the sunshine and enjoying their cocktails, with no offerings of other seating. We moved to the tables in the bar area and the same thing happened, AGAIN! Of course the buck stops at the Managers desk. We might attempt to spend our hard earned money there again... but maybe not. We don&#39;t enjoy spending our money in establishments that make us feel like we are in a trailer park. This is L.A., and this bar isn&#39;t the ONLY bar in town. What a waste of hard earned money. To the men, if you are taking a woman out on a first date to impress her, don&#39;t come here, it&#39;s too &#34;iffy.&#34;	0
I took my girlfriend out on Valentine's day it was great! She loved the food and our waiter was awesome!	1
Great selection of flavorful German beers. OK German food, but I've had better sauerbraten--tasted like it had been in a crock pot a bit too long, sort of dried out. My dining companions said the same thing about their wurst plates--OK, but not great. Big, busy place, but they found a place for eight of us. Waitress was friendly and willing to accommodate separate checks.	0
So delicious! Came here for happy hour, good prices, friendly service and lovely relaxing atmosphere.	0
This is by far my favorite place for coffee, spirits, wine and chocolate in Dane county.	0
Really good! We stopped by on a Wednesday night because we saw they had $1 oysters at the bar. $1 oysters win for me any night of the week :) The bartender was great. Really attentive, offered suggestions. We had oysters (delish and fresh), the cauliflower toast (really good! definitely try), the egg and caviar toast....this one I did not love but I think it was just my personal opinion. I am not a huge caviar fan and the fishiness of it ruined the taste for me. If you like caviar, you will probably love it! And then the grand finale...the Hamachi...holy crap this was good! I am going back for that alone. Fresh raw hamachi with an avocado sauce...DO IT.<br><br>I really enjoyed the ambiance, and the food. I am only giving it 4 stars because the prices are a bit high for what you get. Especially the drinks. My boyfriend got a draft beer, it came in a highball glass and it was $10. For draft! Also, I think $13 is a lot for all of the specialty cocktails since the pour was not exactly heavy.	1
For the vegetarian burger- not fantastic, certainly not worth the price.	0
Their chocolate chip &#34;lava&#34; cookie has made me cry. TWICE! Don&#39;t judge till you taste. ruined a perfectly bad day, had to be happy for the rest of the day. These people. SMH	1
Finally I made it to Brass Tacks! I have heard about this place for a long time and finally the opportunity arose to go here! When we walked in it was during the week and was not busy at all so that was a huge advantage!	1
One of my favorite bars located on 1st st. in little Tokyo. O how lovely it is. The entrance is hidden between a wall of red bricks, lined with white lights. Follow the music as you walk through the brick alley and enter a fun time. Lots of fun drinks, bar food, live music, and super cute patio area. Check out their clock on the wall too! It takes you back into the twilight zone.	1
It has taken me too long to discover this place, specifically the spicy miso ramen. I feel cheated.I live up the street by 2 blocks. One days my friends came over and we decided to try this place instead of waiting the line for Daikokuya in DTLA. What a good decision we made. The lunch special from 11 to 3 is 12 bucks, that includes a salad, a small rice bowl and ramen.I picked the Sunset combo which has the tuna bowl, it has 4 pieces of Tuna which is pretty good for a small side.And I was unsure which ramen to try because I had the regular one before and it was good but meh not that great so I asked the waitress, she told me her favorite is the spicy miso ramen... I was intrigued so I picked that one. My friend's girlfriend pick that one as well. Spicy Miso ramen is special because they stir fried the pork/garlic and the good stuff first before they put the broth is, it makes everything taste better and the aroma is just amazing. The salad came first, it was pretty good- regular salad with decent dressing.Then comes the Tuna Bowl, I was happy with the amount and it was pretty fresh Tuna.Last but not least, the spicy miso ramen. I saw it, it was red, like my pumping blood. I was excited, it smelled amazing. I took the spoon and had a sip of the soup and DOOM DOOM DOOM my world has changed. It is divine intervention by ramen god. It is so good that I finish the noodle, and even the soup.... it's not a light soup, it is quite heavy and oily BUT it was so good I ate it all.I go back religiously once a week or twice a month, here is what I learned though. If you want the best spicy miso ramen with that spiciness that smells like chinese mapo tofu then make sure the ramen master is the older gentleman with a beard/mustache. He makes it much better than the other guys. I actually call ahead to see if he is there before I go. And I figured out his schedule, Saturday lunch time is his shift and now I go on Saturday lunch time.Also, their fried calamari is really good and it has a lot it, worth the price!Please do not go on Saturday lunch time, I would hate to have this place as busy as Daikokuya... go any other day but don't all go at once on Saturday, mucho mucho please.	1
I went to Batch after reading some reviews. I live in Brickell and like to see new places open and try them. My fiancee and I love Pubs and Bars We went here on a Sunday around 3:00 PM wanting to love the place but too many things went wrong. We were sited for more than 20 mins without even a glass of water. I had to approach the hostess and tell her how long we had been waiting for. Then the menu only had brunch stuff, when it was already 3:00 PM, not everybody goes clubbing all night long in Miami, I was looking for lunch and there were only 4 items we could have for lunch in the menu. After a very very looooong wait for our food, so long my drink watered down!! The order came wrong, and cold, so it had been sitting in some part of the kitchen counter for a while. Anyway I did not say anything about my order because I was not going to wait another 20 30 mins to get my order fixed. If the place was full I would understand but it was not that busy outside, inside was empty, and there were around 4 waitresses serving a few tables. The place would be awesome if the service, food, and time is fixed. Anyways, I will give it another try, to see if it was just a bad day or the place really is bad.	0
I hate this place.<br>I hate that they over work their ONE waitress at 2 in the morning to the point of exhaustion and bitterness.<br>I hate that you have to ask said waitress for the basic things to eat your food ie: dadaegi (red pepper paste used to make sullungtang spicy)... utensils... SALT.<br>I hate that the dining room is always disgusting and filled uncleared tables.<br>I hate their menu.<br>I hate their ox tail soup for its OLD OVER COOKED MEAT and flavorless broth.<br>I hate that their TENDON soup has BONES.<br>I hate that they only have two kimchees. <br>I hate their stupid purple rice (alright it is not stupid, but it is ALWAYS burnt.)<br>I hate wasting calories here when Umma Jib and Hodori are so much better. <br><br>I hate this place.	0
Apple Pan is like Splash Mountain... you wait in line forever and the actual ride is like 2 seconds and it's not even that cool. Game plan: you have to find your own seat and hover over people, trying to spy on them to see if they are almost done. As soon as people get up from their seats, you have to grab that crap and hope you got there before the people standing next to you so it's legit. After you finally sit down, your food and the check appears super fast in an effort to minimize your seat occupation. The actual food is okay.. the burgers are too relish-y and the fries are kinda bland, and as you are eating you are quickly ushered out as soon as you show any signs of leaving by next round of hoverers. Buuuut one star for the apple pie and one star for the attentive waiter that kept refilling our ketchup plate.	0
Really guys? I think these four and five star ratings are overly generous. I just had lunch on Miracle Mile at Yuko&#39;s and the experience was thoroughly underwhelming. I bought two rolls. The freshwater eel roll was mediocre, nothing more than what you would expect with low expectations. The shrimp tempura roll was meagerly packed and genuinely tasted like nothing. First my friend had the carrot ginger soup, which was good. And then there Big Ebisu, a big roll of spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, and vegetables, which was gross. All of the sushi had mushy rice, but the Big Ebisu additionally had an undelicious spicy tuna mush that I would have never guessed was fish of my own accord. A waste of tuna. Tuna and skinny shrimp were rolled with leafy greens that made for a roll unlike any I&#39;ve ever tasted. There are definitely better places to go for cheap, simple sushi rolls. I should have known better when my friend prematurely declared feeling full and offered me her last three pieces.	0
Overpriced tasteless bar food. I paid $12 for a pulled pork sandwich that had so much grease it soaked the bottom bun through and was all over the plate. Sandwich was ok but it shouldn't have been more than $9. Food service was fast but the waitress never came back to check on us after ordering or when our food came even though we needed her to fix the drink she mis-ordered. Choose Purple or Potbelly but not this place.	0
canter&#39;s has a very nice, homely feel to it. the waitress that served us, has worked there for 55 years. how beautiful - this is how a regional, cultural institution is built. the breakfast food here is quite affordable and very much reasonable, but i give this place a high mark for its classic, irreplaceable atmosphere.<br><br>the bakery is also quite nice as well. the sweets are gently sweet, without being offensive (unlike the abominable ones found at pavillions or albertsons). <br><br>very reasonable.	1
This place is one word... Amazing. The service was a bit slow, but there&#39;s not much you can do quick when there&#39;s only 3 people working. Other than that the man serving us was very sweet. He greeted us with a warm smile once we walked in. <br><br>Very chill ambiance. Not a lot of seating, it&#39;s kind of a hole in the wall looking place. Newtons has the best egg and cheese sandwich I&#39;ve EVER had, hands down. I also tried the side bread and hummus. Oh yeah, very much so worth the 20 + minute wait. <br><br>I will DEFINITELY be back.	1
Horrid service!! Food was decent. The waitress was quadruple sat and forgot an order. Sigh.	0
In my opinion, there are 2 reasons to dine at Tartine, a cute restaurant in the West Village.<br><br>1) It&#39;s BYOB<br>2) There is an intimate feel inside the restaurant as tables are stacked next to one another (if you like that sort of thing, which i do). What can i say, i like dining next to strangers and engaging in random conversations, if the situation calls for it. <br><br>The food was not impressive, which is unfortunate. Everything was bland! The onion soup was bland - it looked stellar, but the result fell flat. There was just no bite, no strong cheesy onion flavor. It was weak. <br><br>The Steak au poivre also looked great, but just lacked flavor! The sauce looked so rich, and the filet mignonettes looked mouth-watering. But it&#39;s almost as if they didn&#39;t season the steak OR sauce with the most basic of all ingredients - salt. Carnivore that i am - i was only able to finish 2 of the 3 steak mignonettes. Now that is saying something.<br><br>The spicy chicken, which is their signature dish, was also not up to par. Chunks of chicken in a spicy sauce, with a side of guac. Nothing special, although the waitress made it sound like the best thing on planet earth. Sorry, no dice.<br><br>I&#39;d say the best thing we tried was the beet salad. Not bad!<br><br>Well - i wish i could recommend Tartine, because it&#39;s a quaint, ecclectic little restaurant, but the food just did not cut the mustard. But it&#39;s BYOB! Saving grace.	0
We had an amazing time. They do everything right here. Delicious food and wine (as good if not better than when we were in Strasbourg). Perfect ambience for family or a romantic evening. Friendly staff. This place is why we live in Brooklyn.<br>Love love love!	1
Engaging service thanks Phil. Enjoyed the food. The only issue was the size of the booth. Kinda small for four people.	0
A Pacific Islander walks into a bar ... has a good time with friends, both new and old. Enjoyed the Belgian beer list as well as the craft beer in both bottles and on tap. Thought the bread pudding desert was okay as I've had better, but I've also had worse. Experienced very friendly and attentive service and basically had a good time all around. Sums up my first, but not last visit to Little Bear. Not mentioned was the parking. Street parking (free) available if you don't mind walking. Paid parking there too. I didn't hear, but I also didn't ask about validation. I didn't try any of the food but from what I could on other tables, it looked much more tastier than your typical bar food. Definitely on my list of places to return to sample more of their menu. Great open space for group gatherings but call ahead to reserve space if you want seating for a large party.	1
Great old neighborhood bar with good food, and service. This place has an interesting menu with lots of choices. The bike trail is right behind the place if you want to fortify yourself with a Martini halfway through your ride. I grew up a block from here on East Wilson so remember the place from fifty years ago. I know that Mickey was a black lab and thats where the name came from. Look over the bar and there are some rememders of him that you will not notice if I didn't mention it. So I did. You're welcome. In those days they had a pier on the Yahara river which is just across the street, where boaters would tie up and go have a drink and get a six pack to go. The good old days. They have a back room that you might miss unless to go to the toilet and they have small bands here as well. Forget the brunch. Its too popular now and the wait can be long. It is good I just don't like waiting. My wife says Im a grouch, I say I'm just too busy to wait for breakfast. I have spoken.	1
I got the $9.95 galbi special. It definitely tasted like L.A. galbi that I often crave living in Vegas. I got five side dishes with my order - japchae, daikon, spicy tofu, kimchee, and a mini seafood pancake. I wasn&#39;t crazy about their kimchi but overall the galbi tasted good and the side dishes were decent enough. Good portion size for lunch. If you want to satisfy your KBBQ craving at an affordable price, come by. Nothing is over $10. The only thing I didn&#39;t like is the food court atmosphere. It&#39;s depressing here!	1
Went here yesterday for dinner with my father &amp; had a really nice time. We each ordered a glass of wine and a bowl of the soup of the day (something along the lines of corn with pesto served chilled). Then we got four of the small plates to share: beets with pecans &amp; Greek yogurt, peach and heirloom tomatoes with mozzarella, fettuccine with sage and mushrooms, &amp; warm pizza dough with ricotta and pesto. I was really impressed with their vegetarian options. No complaints about the food. My dad and I were both full &amp; quite happy with the meal. Friendly service, too. Cute, small space, but I sat up against the window and a nailhead from the brickwork kept poking me in the back.	1
I stopped by Lincoln Station over the weekend. It&#39;s fairly new so the space still feels a little spare, but the vibe was generally good. There were lots of people at the communal table on their laptops, eating and drinking coffee, and pairs and small groups at the tables lining the walls. <br><br>I got the meatball sandwich and a coffee, and my friend got some sweet treats like the huge chocolate chip cookie. The coffee and treats were great; the sandwich was tasty but a touch dry. But I think the food here will be great in a pinch, like when you&#39;re craving comfort foods like lasagna, or healthy meals like kale and farro salad, but feel too lazy to make them yourself. Great addition to the neighborhood, and I&#39;ll definitely go back.	1
Came here since it had great reviews and smelled so good just by walking by. It was a monday night so there was no wait but they only have these long high tables that seat 8, and they will kinda awkwardly put you next to strangers, so just be prepared to be shoulder to shoulder with a stranger. There really arent many tables since the kitchen takes up a large portion of the restaurant. The ice tea was good and the service was fast. The menu was small, a few appetizers, pizza, and some deserts. The margarita pizza and the mushroom pizza was good. It was a little on the pricey side for pizza, but was pretty good quality.	0
Dinner was good quality. Place was very noisy for a nice restaurant. Difficult to visit with our guests. Service was good if not great. Not even sure where all that noise was coming from. May eat there again one more time (would be our 3rd visit) for lunch. The GF pasta is incredible! I have to admit that. Best I've had to date. Want to share that find with a friend. So there's hope the experience will improve.	1
Food is decent can&#39;t complain the with prices so low, but no customer restrooms??? I swear this maybe illegal at a food and beverage business. Staff is also not very friendly or accommodating.	0
Excellent place!!! That&#39;s all I have to say.	1
Background: I lived in Beijing ten years ago, and I basically haven't eaten Chinese food since. I simply have not found any Chinese food worth eating in Madison or Milwaukee, and after a while I gave up looking.	0
We always go here for the simple yet tasty tapas and some sangria. My favorite is the piquillo relleno w it&#39;s yummy pepper sauce. Chef Felipe always comes out to greet us and thank us for coming back :)	1
Delicious, healthy food, incredibly helpful and friendly staff, charming atmosphere, reasonable prices, what more could you want for a quick lunch or dinner?	1
A couple of months ago, I got horrible food poisoning from this place. I was sick for at least 24 hours, and I know it had to be the food from Rice because it was the only meal I&#39;d eaten that day. I meant to send in a complaint, but never got around to it. Then, in the past two days, I know two other people who have had the same thing happen. They&#39;ve eaten here and several hours later gotten really sick. <br><br>Clearly, the food is not being cooked correctly or there is some sort of health code violation going on here. The food is good, but not worth an entire day of food poisoning. EAT AT YOUR OWN RISK! If anybody knows of an organization I can contact to report this place, please reply.	0
Really good pizza! Nice vibe. Friendly bartenders. No complaints~	1
Not only is the food out of this world AMAZING (and healthy)... but the little restaurant itself a hidden gem in the concrete jungle of Doral. <br><br>Modern, and decorated with colors that inspire freshness...walk all the way to the back of the restaurant and find yourself on a waterfront porch where you can sit back and enjoy your meal. Sit inside or out, the atmosphere is just as lovely as the freshly prepared exotic (and healthy) fruit juices on the menu.	1
ONCE UPON A TIME I WAS FALLING IN LOVE, BUT NOW I'M ONLY FALLING APART. THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO, A TOTAL ECLIPSE OF THE HEART!	0
Great place with an awesome interior design all made from recycled items and materials. We came here for a private event partnered with Revolution Brewing for a 5-course pairing, so I can&#39;t speak too much to the regular menu. But it&#39;s mostly a farm to table menu with all fresh ingredients. Great food! Very fresh and very interesting menu! I&#39;d definitely come back for the regular menu!	1
Excellent sushi!	1
Good food, not for a soft talker.	0
I had the beef casserole and it was delicious ! It was enough to share with two people.	1
Nothing but WONDERFUL things to say about &#34;The Tree&#34;<br><br>Come for Lunch, and then come back again and again and again....<br><br>Unlike Ethan J. points out, the prices are perfectly reasonable and competitive, and sometimes even much cheaper. Not to mention they have a multitude of things that Whole Foods does not carry.<br><br>Lunch is packed... because the food is fresh, delicious, and cooked with love.. and Vegan!<br><br>You are greatly missing out if you have never been here.	1
Positives: Quick friendly service, and food came out very quick.Negatives: The food I ordered was the very generic was quite tasteless. Egg roll that came with my order was soft and tasted of oil. Rice seemed like it was 3 days old. Food was nothing special. The broccoli and beef that I ordered literally tasted of the "supermarket chinese food" variety--you know, the chinese food at the supermaket that are on heating trays and you just scoop what you want you want into the box. Also the kung pao chicken was greasier than Walmart parking lot.Overall, it's bad chinese food that is quite expensive. Personally, there are so many better options around the city for chinese. Please don't waste your time and money here.	0
Erm... the taco truck near my work place tastes better than this	0
mmmm the lobster grilled cheese! I don't think it was real lobster b/c it was only $10 lol. But, it was savory and delicious AND HUGE. I can usually eat A LOT, but I had to to-go box half the sandwich. I love the portion size (HUGE), love the price (most of the items were $7-$10), and the food was pretty good. I want to come back and try some of the other things on the menu. Next time I want to order the chili cheese fries and share it with my friends b/c it looked soooo good.	1
The menu is trying a little too hard to be hip, but eh. Overall nice atmosphere, seems to be a bar scene happening. I prefer the food at Pot. The ambiance here.	1
I was pretty excited about coming here since the photos looked good and we were in a quest to find new places to go and try. Turns out this place was not up to my expectations. The service was very slow and the food was out right bland. First I thought it was me but turns out everyone else was on the same page and that was eight of us that evening. <br><br>I first started out with the corn bread with whipped butter and honey. That loaf was overcooked and broke apart when I started cutting into it. Maybe it was low salt night or something but I want a delicious meal based on past reviews and photos. A couple dishes I wanted to order no longer exist on the current menu. I think they should remove all the photos that don&#39;t pertain to their current menu because it is misleading. <br><br>Would I ever come back and the answer is NO because it offers items that they really don&#39;t offer and service and food are not up to par.	0
I went for brunch and got the endless mimosas (amazing amazing amazing, by the way). The short rib hash is an absolute must have. My partner got the cornbread Benedict and he loved it so much. He&#39;s usually a picky eater, but he devoured the entire thing without sharing with me. <br><br>If you&#39;re lucky enough to go there when Melissa is your server, count your lucky stars. She made sure that our experience was superb and enjoyable. <br><br>Protip: get the bulldog. It&#39;s a secret cocktail off their old menu. It&#39;s a passion fruit spicy margarita and it&#39;s to die for.	1
Tried this place on a recommendation, and it was crazy good. I got the Horse and Hole - roast beef, horseradish cream, roasted mushrooms and provo, and it was good- real good. That horseradish clears the sinuses let me tell you. Fries cooked in 100% beef fat (can I get an amen?) and chocolate shake were awesome. If I'm ever back in the area around lunch time, you better believe I know where I'm goin.	1
Great place! Romantic, great prices for the quality of food, great for small groups. The food is always delicious every time I go. They serve really good portions so you feel like you got your money's worth. It's not too fussy but a very cool, quiet place to dine. EXCELLENT!!	1
Worth it! Nice atmosphere and great pizza.I Had the San Daniele with a Kola and my Dauther had the quattro formaggi pizza. we will be back!	1
The dish I had today reminds me of a Thai restaurant that I loved in downtown Edmonds that closed about 10 years ago.	1
3 bad things:<br><br>1) There is sometimes a 15- 30 minute wait just to get in<br>2) You may have to wait 15-35 minutes to get your drinks when it&#39;s super busy and you are seated.<br>3) The food menu is not exhaustive...many items are missing and there is no full meal to be had.<br><br>3 Great things about this place<br><br>1) View is awesome<br>2) There is no cover charge and no Hollywood style BS at the door<br>3) There are tons of people dressed nice and an amazing atmosphere in which to meet people and mingle.<br><br>Hope you liked my small review.	1
I have been coming here off and on for the past couple of years. For a quick filling bite, the wraps are best to order. The falafels are pretty tasty as well, and can be requested to be made spicy. I&#39;ve had more items from their menu, but we mostly go for the gyros or the shawarmas! <br><br>The ambience is adequate since most are just going in to get the quick bite to go, just wish they would expand into a bigger place (maybe a little closer to the 215/decatur area - please?)! Owners are very friendly and will recognize you after a few visits (if not by name, definitely by face)! So that&#39;s a plus! They are very friendly towards children to. The one time I had my daughter (she was a little over 2) sit down to eat, the owners brought ought a couple of extra goodies without extra charges.<br><br>The bonus is that this location is next to the Ace Hardware store which has a lot of Hawaiian snack goodies we like to get.<br><br>I&#39;ll be back here soon!	1
Great food, breakfast or dinner. Cocktails... Moscow Mule.	1
This place is great. Lots of character, house cocktails are fantastic, huge wine selection, and most importantly, it has my favorite recipe for gnocchi!! I get it every time I go. The chanterelle mushrooms in this dish is what makes it so yummy. Oh, and the cream.... the cream. :) Service is good. Noise level can be pretty high on certain nights. If you get seated in the "greenhouse" be sure to dress for the tropics. It gets hot out there under the heat lamps.	1
Cute and cozy spot in Williamsburg. Great for a date night or getting together with friends. 5 people shared the meatballs, mussells, polenta, shrimp pesto, bolognase and mushroom pastas. All the food was delish but the wait staff was a little misleading when letting us know the portion sizes. The meatballs, mussels, and polenta were all great appetizers but they told us that 1 plate of pasta would feed two people and that was not the case. I could have easily eaten a whole pasta dish on my own. Be aware that if you are big on dessert their choices are very limited. Overall the food was delicious and I would definitely return.	1
Ms Cheezious is a sexy bitch of a food truck.<br><br>Imagine a cartooned hottie with curves like the autobahn that makes grilled cheese sammies to perfection. If I were a male food truck, I would &#34;hit that&#34;<br>Good thing for us humans that Mrs Cheezious serves ups some delectable grilled cheezus.<br>I was food sharing on this occasion and had a ricotta and orange marmalade grilled cheeze sammy on texas toast and a side of chocolate dipping sauce to top it off. I love being an indulgeress. <br>It took quite some time for me to get my sandwich. Apparently Ms. Cheezious is not as fast and loose as I hoped she would be.<br>The sandwich was well worth the wait. It was delicious, not greesy and reminded me of The French Toast stuffed with Orange Marmalade I fancy at Mimi&#39;s Cafe in Southern Califiornia.<br>Nectarous and creamy and not overtly sweet it hit the spot as my last stop on my food truck gorge fest. <br>I would absolutely return to little Ms. Cheezious if she promises to put out a little faster.<br>Fast cheezious is good cheezious.	1
I don't get it. I don't get the raving reviews. You have several, far better, pizza joints within walking distance. The place "looks" good from the outside, but the pizza is so-so and the price and service is ok. I've even gone back just to make sure I wasn't unlucky. I guess pizza is in the taste buds of the beholder.	0
I ordered the carnitas &amp; was not pleased. It was basically a big ole hunk of beef with very little sauce underneath. Nothing to eat with it (basically a la carte but the menu doesn&#39;t mention that) Not flavorful at all. =-(<br><br>My appetizer was the queso dip w/ chips. VERY TASTY!!<br><br>Also, don&#39;t bother ordering the $4 Mexican Coca Cola. There&#39;s not much difference between that &amp; a regular Coke. Thicker but less carbonation.	0
Came here to try out their infamous garlic crab after a recommendation from a friend. Can't say that it's the best crab I've ever had, but its decent. The other dishes we ordered were pretty standard. Was expecting a lot better taste when it came to food, so don't think its a must next time I visit SF.	0
1. Scone amazing	0
DANGER!!! STAY AWAY!!!! Service is horrible!!!	0
The portabello mushroom burger with caramelized onions was the tastiest thing to caress my taste buds in months. The sweet potato fries were standard yet still quite good. The iced tea is a spicy Japanese green tea with a bit of sugar added. Next visit I will try the tempura onion rings. This burger was worth the $10. No question. Love that Amoeba and the Hotel Cafe are both about a 2 minute walk away.	1
Very interesting menu, although I'd have preferred more gluten free, especially bread and pasta.	1
Incredible fried chicken sandwich. It&#39;s a small storefront so I&#39;ve always gotten it to go, but they package it in a box with a red checkered paper so it feels like a real picnic. <br><br>I&#39;ve gotten both the spicy chicken sandwich and the Nashville hot. Both are recommended! The mac and cheese at times is really good, and at others...meh. But I still recommend it. Tried the bread pudding for the first time this afternoon. Do yourself a favor and get it.<br><br>I love Honey Butter, but Roost is a real standout in the city.	1
Open 24 hours! Great staff and a good variety! I ordered the breakfast sandwich "Kitchen Sink" and is was SO good! In addition to breakfast they have lunch, fresh juice (bottled or squeezed OJ), treats and more!	1
Yummy food and good deal from <a href="/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&amp;s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Restaurant.com</a>!	1
Been a long time customer for years now and today&#39;s visit just sealed the deal for me...<br><br>For as long as I&#39;ve been going to this place, I loved their tasteful yet expensive ($5.50 for just 6 pieces) soup dumplings. At first, I really didn&#39;t mind the pricing since their dumplings were the best I&#39;ve had in NYC. I even gave their noodles and scallion pancakes a few tries after completely falling in love with this place.<br><br>However, today&#39;s experience was just absolutely horrible. I first walked in and noticed their expansion - wow finally! More tables for more customers for their great food! NOT!!!! The boss thought he&#39;d be a smart greedy idiot - doubled the size of the restaurant, but did not hire any additional waitresses. <br><br>First, I HAD TO GO GRAB THE MENUS MYSELF AFTER WAITING 10 MINUTES FOR THE WAITRESS TO BRING ME THE MENU.<br><br>Second, ordered my dumplings. Waitress gave us a heads up it will be 35 minutes of wait. Fine, whatever, I&#39;ve done it before. Thirty-five minutes came and went, so we asked the status of our dumplings. The manager comes by and tells us it&#39;ll be another 10 minutes. By then, I ran out of patience as my quarters were running up in the meter. I decided to cancel after waiting almost ONE HOUR for my dumplings. <br><br>Not to mention, the tables around me ordered fried dumplings. They came out so burnt that the two tables had to tell them to take it back and remake or cancel order...<br><br>This place has gone DOWNHILL since its expansion. Burnt food, horrible customer service, ONE HOUR WAIT on dumplings. <br><br>I will not be returning to this place as there are sooooooo many other places in Flushing that I can spend my $$ at.<br><br>For those that &#34;ABSOLUTELY SWEAR&#34; by this place, BULLSHYT comes at $5.50 for 6 piece and an ONE HOUR WAIT. Enjoy!	0
This is an all-time favorite of many westsiders who queue up for as many as 30 minutes to get a coveted seat at the counter-only burger joint. The burgers are great, but probably get more culinary credit than they deserve due to some weird halo affect that sits over this ancient burger stand.And, I do agree with some of the other comments: Gordon the waiter is not shy about being mean (enough with the intimidating demeanor), the food is overpriced (but less than a $15 burger at Banderas), and the burgers have too much lettuce (but just ask for easy lettuce).All that aside, I love taking my kids there; they'll remember having burgers with Dad their whole life.	1
The food is yummylicious, atmosphere is dark and sexy...a total date spot! Keep one thing in mind...be slick when checking out the hot bartender Derrick while on your date....lol! He is quite tempting ;) I wish I could dip him in the cheese fondue which is quite excellent by the way.<br>Valet parking available and they also have a great happy hour! Cheers!	1
Besides waiting over an hour (we were told 45 minutes AND it was a Friday night) for a table we had fun people watching. Then besides waiting for a good while for service and our apps, drinks, and dinner the food was very tasty. I heard the Wood Oven Roasted Bone Marrow w/ Parsley, Capers & Shallots was excellent (sorry, I was too involved with my Pappardelle w/ House Made Sausage, Fresh English Peas & Ricotta).My one other complaint is this: when dessert arrived I asked if there were nuts on the ice cream and the response was, "I don't know?" To which I replied, "Well, I would like to know since I am allergic." How can you not know what you are serving?	1
Not impressed. Maybe I&#39;d go back for brunch or to sit at the bar, but definitely not for dinner.<br><br>I was with one friend. We ordered a $14 heirloom tomato salad. The cheese was runny, the portion was miniscule, and one of the few, larger tomatoes was rock hard, solid. The mushroom pot was good, but is essentially just a tasty spread for crostini. The duck was strictly average. Also, while the one cocktail I had was decent, it didn&#39;t have anything on what you can get at Death &amp; Company or Mayahuel.<br><br>The room is nice though and the staff was very friendly and attentive. I&#39;d maybe go back for the brunch, which seems reasonably priced, If I was in a scene-tolerant mood. Or I&#39;d sit at the bar for drinks and a snack. I definitely wouldn&#39;t waste my money on another dinner!	0
Came here for brunch a few weeks ago. The food was actually really good and the bottomless mimosas strong and continually refilled. I have to give Bisou 1 star though because my friends and I were literally thrown out after we paid because they "needed the table" (even though the restaurant was 2/3 empty). Half of us were still finishing our meals. It was probably the rudest I've ever been treated at a restaurant. I'd like to give it another chance, but that experience definitely left a sour taste in my mouth.	0
Really enjoyed my meal there - they had a seafood/broth dish that was so good I slurped up every last drop. 	1
4.5! I've only had lunch brought in from here. So this review is only about the yummy stuff :D *Turkey Chili: I had mine a little cold but it was still good. I could only imagine what it would be like piping hot. For some reason mine didn't come with cornbread (i got some other carb) but that's cool, I don't like corn bread anyways. *Ahi Tuna Tartare & Avocado Tostada (bby arugula, mesclun mix, cucumber): The dressing on this was SUPER tasty. Very flavorful and light. Highly recommended! *Tandoori Chicken on Quinoa & Lentils (Tomato Apple Chutney) - I love this bowl! It's super tasty but obviously not traditional tandoori. The quinoa tastes like it's infused with coconut milk. Does that still make it healthy? :P*Grilled Salmon on Brown Rice (sprouts, mango, vegetable julienne, baby spinach, miso tamari dressing): Salmon + Mango + Miso? Sounds weird I know! But Bloom Cafe makes it work! *Wild Mahi Mahi Taco: Very tasty. A little fishy at first but nothing the magic sauce can't fix. I believe it comes standard with a side of quinoa but I swapped it out. *Turkey Burger: Meh. Also, I'd avoid the fries that come with it. They're not very exciting. The green pesto-y dip is delicious but I like it better on my sandwich.Many of my coworkers order the Grilled Chicken and Quinoa Salad (diced apple, butternut squash, green beans, spinach, orange blossom honey vinaigrette). It looks awesomely tasty AND healthy. Breakfast is served until 2:45p! Take advantage!	1
Had a great time at Bunbury. The ambiance is very cozy and romantic. The food and wine were great. Happened to be there on a night that they were having a special on bottles of Rutini wine, which was AWESOME. The food was tapas style - a selection of empanadas (all fantastic), burrata salad (also good) and shrimp balls (as in balls of ground shrimp, not the other type of balls). I didnt care for the shrimp balls, but to be fair, The conversation and wine took over and by the time I got to them, they were cold. All in all, very nice and will be going back!	1
We had confirmed reservations for seven for 11 AM in Easter. When we arrived, the restaurant was closed with no sight of anyone inside and no note on the door. I understand that hiccups happen, but this is Easter Sunday brunch. We had to scramble to find a place that could accommodate us.	0
A co-worker and I stopped in for a late lunch when we were attending a work conference at the Convention Center since it was only a block away. Key word here being late meaning toward the end of the lunch rush. 	0
A hipster's Denny's. Swingers in Los Feliz. Food's just okay. Service sucks. Go when you're drunk enough not to care, after you've spent hours watching Marty and Elaine at the Dresden. Go when it's late and there's nothing else open. If it's early enough, go to Cafe Figaro a few doors down. Or for brunch, the Hollywood Hills Cafe across the street.I sat next to Jason Lee once. It was a Tuesday afternoon (you won't see celebrities there on the weekends).	0
If this is what an English bar/restaurant could be, then Chicago needs to start getting more of &#39;em.<br><br>Let&#39;s start with the great decor. It felt like I was eating in the study room of some house. Lots of wood and brass. The first floor is a great deal of booths and a nice long bar. We then headed upstairs as we were a bit early for our reservation and I suggest everyone do this. The upstairs has this great fireplace and lounge area with a smaller bar that has the same selection as the one downstairs.<br><br>The staff were all cool. Our bartender upstairs was chatty and great with suggestions. Our server was very cool and great at describing all the dishes. When one of my friends mentioned that she had a sore throat the bartender downstairs made an excellent warm drink for her.<br><br>The food was also very good. The bangers and mash were excellent and I had an English version of a BLT that was outstanding. Definitely looking forward to going here again.	1
Having been here many times before and enjoying each occasion, I was very disappointed with everything from the moment we checked in until leaving.  The table was too small for a party of 6, being bumped by all of those seated and walking by, the service was very poor, had to ask about specials, had to ask for water, remind the waitress for requested items, tell the servers that were walking from table to table that they had OUR food,  had to request additional drinks, because no one was asking if we would like more of anything, order a salad topped with Salmon, the piece was so small compared to the price in addition there was chicken in the salad,  had to ask for dessert menus, would have enjoyed more coffee but none was offered.	0
we came here for dineLA and the food was superb. We had reservations at 9pm and it was super packed. We had to wait a bit before we couldn't actually get seated but we got a few tasty drinks at the bar so I didn't mind. The cauliflower and the duck breast was my favorite. It was simply delicious! On a side note, due to the long wait, the manager came out to apologize and comped our first round of drinks. I would definitely come back here but maybe not on the weekend when it's super crowded.	1
Made bar reservations about 2 months ago to have NYE drinks here. We specifically said we were not eating just having drinks. Made the reservations for 11pm. Get a call today, NYE, that we are no longer allowed to just have drinks we have to have the pre fixe menu or spend a minimum of $280. (We already had dinner reservations elsewhere). We traveled from San Diego and Sacramento to celebrate with family. It was just disappointing. The manager, Amber, wasn't even willing to work with us. Not sure we are ever going to make it there.	0
Went with a friend and was told outside that half of my conversation was lost!	0
I really wanted to like Mina&#39;s. Their menu looked promising and the reviews were pretty good. Unfortunately, my experience was...meh. <br><br>My mom and I came in for dinner and they initially tried to put us in a booth that was awkwardly curved around and very close to a couple that was sitting there. It required my mom and I to sit next to each other rather than across from each other because there was a man across from us at the table. Very strange. So we requested a table. For a new place, the chairs were wobbly and uncomfortable. <br><br>Our waitress comes by and we made her aware of my mom&#39;s recently discovered food allergies. We had just returned from a vacation up North where restaurants go above and beyond to be accommodating for food allergies. Not the case at Mina&#39;s. Our waitress couldn&#39;t even tell us what was in most of the items on the menu. <br><br>My mom ordered their slider samplers with everything on the side (so she could pick and choose what she knew she could eat) and I had their Greek lasagna. We also ordered a side of spanakopita. The spanakopita was the best part of the meal even though it was a small portion. My Greek lasagna bordered on gross. It was penne with a beef ragout baked in dough with what I detected as cinnamon and/or nutmeg. I didn&#39;t even mind that it was a small portion because I didn&#39;t really want to eat more of it. My mom&#39;s sliders were teeny and were filled with very little meat for $15, and most of the plate was covered with sliced onions, lettuce, and small cups of various sauces. We asked our waitress if there was anything in their &#34;salsa&#34; that could be harmful to my mom with her allergies. She replied basically saying that half the ingredients of the salsa were things that we told her my mom could not eat, but she served it anyway without warning. Thank God we asked or she would be in the ER. To top it off, the meat was dry and lacked flavor. <br><br>When we were asked if we wanted to dessert, I lied and said we were full and would just like the check. Even though some things looked good (some of the sauces were tasty and would be nice to do apps and wine there), because of the issues we encountered, it&#39;s unlikely that I&#39;ll return to Mina&#39;s.	0
Quite possibly the most amazing peice of ham steak I have ever had!	0
Hickory burgers are to die for. It pretty much is what it is. I love the crispy fries and the hunk of iceberg lettuce making me feel like i&#39;ve eaten some vegetables with my burger.<br><br>Apple pie was disappointing, but you can&#39;t win &#39;em all!<br><br>The only meal I could have for lunch that would keep me full until I got off work so it got a lot of love.	1
Finally!!! This restaurant is exactly what this neighborhood needs. Wish it was around when I lived here. This is farm to table at its best. And it&#39;s ...delicious! Here&#39;s some highlights: backyard, great beer list, menu that would empress any foodie and the service was FAB!!! 5 stars! If you go for brunch, the breakfast gnocchi is a must have!	1
Stick with the Girl and the Goat<br><br>I went here with a friend for dinner the other night and was disappointed, to say the least.<br><br>Positives: our waitress was fabulous and the little goat coffee was delicious. In addition, we also had the cake of the day, which was a mix of chocolate and something and that was heaven in our mouths. <br><br>Negatives: all the other food we had. We started out with the fried pickles and onion rings. They were disappointing -- ate two and left the rest. For the main course, I had the chickpea salad (blah) and my friend had the kimchee &amp; bacon &amp; eggs &amp; pancakes asian style breakfast tasty thing.<br><br>To say the least, it&#39;s name should be revoked -- it was not tasty at all!<br><br>Next time, if we go back, I&#39;m sticking to blueberry pancakes and shakes. Maybe I should have know better than to order a salad at a diner, even if it is an upscale diner.	0
OK, so this place offers amazing breakfasts (I had an egg dish with green onions, spinach, feta and giant pieces of artichoke that also came with 4 pieces of toast and a massive pile of potatoes all of which rocked and made for enough breakfast the next day!). We had the cutest and snarkiest waitress who was on top of her game even with a packed room, and basically had an all around pleasant meal.	0
Let me preface this review with.... I LOVED CAFE TOKYO. I almost shed a tear when I saw they had closed in Town &amp; Country mall.... then I heard the great news about a year later. They had opened elsewhere as J Tokyo, hooray!<br><br>This place is not quite the same. It has new, modern sushi rolls. The prices are a bit more than I remember. And sadly, it was very empty inside. It is larger and more square shaped rather than the oddly shaped Cafe Tokyo, but they are managing. The decor is kinda boring, they could spice it up a bit somehow.<br><br>The waitress was nice and I recognized some of the old staff too. They gave us a complimentary crab tomato vinegar salad, just like the good old days how they used to. And on to the food:<br><br>The catepillar roll was very good, the black widow very yummy, the dynamite roll pretty good too. Spider roll good as always. Fish katsu lunch box was my favorite, good deal for the price. Everything was exceptional but for some reason.... nothing really jumped out too much at me. Just that it all was good enough to go back. Again and again. <br><br>Definitely one of the top sushi places in Miami, not my favorite anymore, but up there.	1
Must have gone on an off night. Have heard good things about the pizza here, and really wanted to like it, but the pizza dough, sauce and (veggie) toppings were all completely bland and tasteless :(<br>YMMV...	0
We made our own Margarita pizza with mushrooms and half italian sausage and half spicy calabrese sausage.	0
My customers and I ordered steaks.  I must say the service, appetizers and side dishes were great!  We must have caught them on a bad night because our steaks were almost uneatable.  One of my customers cut of a large pile of gristle off from his steak.  Once again, we must have been there on a bad night.  I was very disappointed and had to apologize to my customers.	0
Nice brunch atmosphere, friendly service. Welcoming to kids. Very good quiche. Potatoes a little spicier than expected.	0
Love their bar.	1
I thought L&#39;Artusi was pretty overrated. <br><br>My gnocchi wasn&#39;t life changing and all of our portions were very small. <br><br>We ordered multiple dishes between the two of us but I walked away still hungry. <br><br>None of the food stood out as incredible, and I didn&#39;t like the long, narrowness of the place. <br><br>It was also very loud for the upscale setting. <br><br>I felt like I was sitting on top of our neighbors, and not in the cute dive bar kind of way... more in the I am getting so screwed when the check comes and I&#39;m not even comfortable way.	0
Not sure why this place doesn't have more stars, but I imagine in time it will. Great food in big portions and very decent prices. The staff was also super friendly. I was pleasantly surprised at the small but excellent selection of local craft beers. I had the pulled pork sandwich sans bread and wrapped in lettuce. It was very delicious, but I could only eat half of it because it was so huge. Thankfully, they have to-go containers sitting out. Other perks were their pickled veggies and house ketchups/sauces. One small annoyance was the lack of menus. They had one laminated menu to read while in line, but otherwise, you had to go off the chalk board menu behind the register that was hard to read and lacked descriptions (and many of their items need descriptions to know what you're ordering). Chalkboards look cool, but they are pretty annoying to read. Oh, and extra kudos for a HUGE free parking lot (at least on a Tuesday) and a nice big bike rack. I will be returning very soon.	1
Do not go if you&#39;re hungry. It is over priced and I left still hungry. The ambiance is cool and the service was great but god damn! I will never go back. Everything is served tapas style and for $20 bucks you get four tiny pieces of fish. Needless to say I did not have a good experience.	0
Waiter was very helpful.  Food was good. Nice atmosphere.	1
Mission accomplished!	1
Oh gosh. Cinnamon-crusted french toast. That's mostly all you need to know.	0
Hmm...	0
This place is pricy! But they serve damn good coffee and the food is pretty delicious. If you don't mind dropping 20 bucks it's a good place to camp out and get work done, or take your date in the morning. Note that the wifi is slow and goes out intermittently. The shop itself is connected to a ballet studio, which is pretty cool.	1
While this place looked very hip and very San Francisco, the food was really bad. I've never been so inclined to say how much I disliked a restaurant before. Even the dessert was awful. Don't waste your money.	0
I am big fan for a Ramen.. They gave me "Tan-Tan Ramen" with miso base soup adding hot oil that's it... that's Not Tan-tan Ramen.. the noodle texture just like instant noodle, and the noodle takes up the soup although done in cooking process. And the worst thing I was very thirsty after eat here.. the MSG was play role on this for sure. Sorry I'm not going back. If you're Ramen hunter.. this is definitely not a ramen place to go.	0
Great little diner!	1
When I was craving for some crab croquettes, of course, Muramoto came to our mind. The croquettes never failed to make me happy.	0
Dont get me wrong, the burger and truffle fries was great. The service, NOT so great. The server was a total asshole, and when I asked him a question, he seemed pissed about it. What an old fucker!I recommend the Umami in Studio City. The servers were nicer, cuter, and younger!! : )	0
Two of us enjoyed the excellent mixed grill, the other two had prime rib.  It's almost sinful, the size of the Prime Rib - could feed two or three easily - indeed I brought home a leftover for two lunches!  Creamed spinach and asparagus were excellent.  Only problem - we had no room for any of their fabulous desserts.	1
Soup of the day was pozole. Not like mom&#39;s pozole but very good, Monte 52. The sandwiches are yummy. Gourmet sammies! Beer selection is sweet and they have other treats and Mexican/Latino delights for you impulse-buyers. Oh, and the carnicero in the meat dept is nice to look at.	1
I live across the street and it saddens me that I don't spend more time here. The coffee is delicious, the vibe is nice and I appreciate the no laptop tables.	1
Bomb Pizza!<br>I ordered 3 different ones<br>Stef&#39;s Sloppy Pig<br>Midnight in The Garden<br>Buffalo Soldier<br>The slices are HUGE. I believe in total it came out to about $65. <br>We will be ordering here again for sure.	1
Over hyped. Not anything special. Service was pretty shitty. Tried to charge me for a bottle of wine when I got a glass, if I said nothin they would have done nothing. Also, the waiter seemed disappointed that I caught it. Not that I&#39;m saying any shady stuff was goin down, but who knows. <br><br>Atmosphere was lively and nice, space was cool, but our table was shoulder to shoulder with the other table next to us, which i absolutely despise. This forces you into conversation with whoever is sitting next to you, simply because, THEY CAN HEAR EVERYTHING YOU SAY!. Agh, so annoying. I am not anti social, I just do not want to talk to you. <br><br>Food was not good, and the portions were so small you have to order at least $100 worth of food to get full. I got:<br><br>Goat Empenadas: These were a special item, they were good, but nothing really blew me away about them. <br><br>Hawaiian Sunfish: Bland, really. Nice texture though, but a strike out overall on flavor for me. Capers made it worse. <br><br>Escargot ravioli: Terrible, this was just awful. None of the flavors went well together, seemed like the chef&#39;s were like &#34;Lets see if we can get away with this one.&#34; <br><br>Pork Ribs: Sucked, I thought this would be the saving grace, but it was on par with everything else, bland and misguided. The meat was tough and overcooked. And $18 for 4 ribs? Fuck that. <br><br>Sweet potato Mushroom Creme Fraiche: Really good. <br><br>Pork fat donuts: Finally, I thought. Something I had at longman and eagle, so this will be good. Wrong. They tasted stale, like they had been there for 2 days at least. <br><br>Goat cheese whatever dessert: This was really good. <br><br>Drinks:<br><br>Aviation: Tasty! Liked this a lot. <br><br>Double Barrel Manhattan: Awful! Tasted like straight up whiskey. And two shriveled ass cherries in a martini glass did not a Manhattan make. <br><br>House wine: God awful, tasted like a cheap merlot. Hated it. <br><br>We were going to order the Chickpea fritters, but our server said, and I quote, &#34;That is the weaskest thing on the menu.&#34; Really? The weakest thing? That is a terrible way to speak about a fancy restaurant that charges $18 for 4 ribs. Also, it kind of felt like a slam to my date. A little pissed about that. <br><br>Left pretty messed up. Felt a bit like I just got my pants pulled down at my grandmothers funeral. Which is not a nice feeling. If I am going to drop over $200 on dinner, I am going back to Blackbird or Schwa.<br><br>Side note: manager messaged me on here &amp; said can I have your number to discuss? Gave it up, no response, so now it is at 1 star.	0
I took my wife here for her birthday and could not have had a nicer time. Wonderful, nice staff...very friendly...very Italian...cheery, attentive. The decor was clean and simple with lots of Italian farm / mill decorations hanging up. The food was amazing! We had an incredible meal -- the food was outstanding! They do have wine now, by the way. They need to update their web site.<br>Easily one of the best restaurants I have been to in ages. Molto bene!!!	1
Americanized viet sandwiches. Definitely doesn't compare but it's still a good sandwich. I'm rating this based on the comparison between a real viet sandwich and how they make it here.	0
I was at this location a week ago and I ordered a new dish they have, its called Thai hot pot, I was really looking forward to try it and unfortunately it failed completely. It was a big bowl with 90% water and 5% coconut milk (if there was any), three pieces of shredded chicken and pork each (all gummy), 5-6 spinach leaves, some noodles at the bottom and a few tomato chunks, the only good thing was the flatbread, nice flavor and crispy. I ate some since I was hungry but I will not ordered it again. This is not the first time I get a bland dish at this place, I think it's losing quality.	0
If you want to go to a dive in downtown Madison, then you definitely should check out Paradise. There's 2 reasons why Paradise gets a 5 in my book:	1
Oh, Fred. I really want to LOVE this place, but I can't. The Mac and Cheese balls are good but I would never crave them. The southwest-type salad is good, but not better than, well, almost every other salad I've had at that price. The 'Dime Bag' breakfast (2 pancakes, bacon, eggs, tomatoes, hash browns, etc.) was actually the best thing I've ordered there - problem is I could get it anywhere. And the egg sandwich? Boring. :(	0
Just ordered the tuna panini. It was delivered promptly and still hot. The gal on the phone was really nice and the man who delivered the food was patient and smiled (a big deal believe it or not). Would definitely get food from them again.	1
I love coming to this place when you're in the mood for a burger, but don't want the crazy fat from a fast food place. I've ordered various burgers here - including the veggie patty and I haven't had a bad experience yet, maybe because I built it myself. :-) ...not to toot my own horn or anything. The custom built burgers are brilliant! Love this place exactly for that reason!! Sweet Potato fries and Parmesan fries are a food lovers heaven. You will definitely end up inhaling them!	1
I LOVE LUNA PARK!My impression is EVEN BETTER now that I come here often.I reviewed this place in 2013 before I started leasing office space in the building above. Now I bring clients and friends here about once or twice a week and I love it even more.The food is just so good. Fresh, healthy, inventive and awesome. The salads (especially the Bloomsdale Spinach Salad) are fantastic. And the s'mores dessert is a MUST when you want to indulge!The staff is LOVELY! I adore Scott who works at the bar / lunch service. He is attentive and shy and super sweet. And the Owner Maria is just so damn awesome. They always remember me, accommodate me and make my clients and friends and us feel cared for and special.Parking is easy, valet under the building.HIGHLY RECOMMEND! Business or pleasure. You will be HAPPY!	1
The best of the best cafes in LA, LA Cafe! This is probably the #1 Cafe in the books. Here's why:-24 hrs service-Serves Breakfast, Brunch, Lunch and Dinner-Online order-Delivery-Fresh produce-Friendly staff-Quick delivery service...Need I continue? Details? Okay, Sometimes, I just get tired of eating the stuff they serve at work. Yes, I'm lucky they even serve us at work. But it's not always the healthiest option. So my coworker and I decided to order out. I looked through the menu online and proceeded to make my log in account. There's even a timer that will calculate how long and give you an ETA on your order. Love that. So i get through everything and realized I've selected carry out. Noooooooo! There was no retracking to the order page so I just called in. The lady the answered the phone quickly checked and confirmed my order and was sweet over the phone, fixed my order and added me on the record since I didn't get a chance to enter my cc info to purchase.The delivery guy shows up at my desk in 20 mins. That was so quick and perfect timing since I was due to clock out for break. Our building orders from LA Cafe frequent and the food is always delicious.-Grilled Salmon tacos (3) with Mango salsa: 5 star-Grilled Chicken with grilled veggies: 5 star-(had a taste) Lobster grilled cheese sandwich: 3 star (taste great, just too heavy)-Coworker "That was the best burger I've ever had." Yummy seasoned fries.So many great options to choose from. Perfect place for DTLA.Cheers!	1
Don't be deceived by Google Street View it was before the massive remodel. Pulcinella is a great destination for dinner. If you're going on a Friday or Saturday prepare to wait. It's well worth it though!	1
OK so I&#39;ve eaten here a few different times and every time its been great. Tonight though i had them deliver dinner because they do offer delivery and was pretty disappointed. I got the brushetta, the pot roast and the chocolate cake for dessert (all for my wife and I to share). The brushetta bread was burnt, the actual brushetta was literally soaked with balsamic vinaigrette so it was pretty mushy and the pot roast looked like it might have been sitting around a while because when we got it the gravy had already cooled down and looked kind of like a jelly substance. Now I know that none of these problems would have happened had we gone in to eat at the restaurant, but I feel like we were taken advantage of because we were not sitting inside the restaurant and they knew that we would not be able to send the food back. For reference, I live about a block away from the restaurant so there&#39;s no way that it would&#39;ve cooled down that much or for the brushetta to saturate in the vinaigrette. What they also fail to tell you over the phone when you order is that they already include gratuity so you don&#39;t get the choice on how much you get to give. Overall, definitely dissapointed in the food quality.	0
I don't know what all the rave is about with this place. They'e suppose to be famous for their dumplings but I didn't notice anything special about them. They hardly had any taste, maybe cause people are more health conscience and like less salt on their foods. Their shanghai dumplings were so dinky and tiny. They had lots of broth that burned my tongue =[ but I've had better. Their green onion pancake tasted like nothing. Their beef chow fun tasted like msg, and was SOAKED in oil. The place is small and cramp. I guess some may call it cozy. The meal would had been more appetizing had the dishes been cleaned properly. The tea cups had tea stain, the chop sticks, spoons and plates still had bits of food stuck to them. And all the plates at our table were chipped. o_O I will not be returning since there are better places that don't try to pack you inside like sardines in a can, and that have better food.	0
Canters is not for everyone. It is a traditional place that either you grew up with, or grows on you. The staff is not going to kiss your butt, or pull your seat out for you. Your not going to get fancy dishes, or cloth napkins. What you will get is good, solid deli style food. I recommend the Fresser, the knish (w/gravy), sweet potato fries, or any other "traditional' deli food. This is not the place to order spaghetti, or any other off topic food. It's a bit pricey, but in line with other LA deli's. The bakery is awesome and surprisingly reasonable. Make sure you get a number before getting in line at the bakery or deli counter. It is best to have some cash on hand as the process will go smoother. You can use a debit/credit card, but you will have to get your bakery slip, go to the register, pay and then go back to the bakery...kind of a pain. If you have a big order, it is best to call ahead. Over all, it is an LA staple and worth at least one trip!	1
I was so excited to try out BFG (now Strip N Dip), since I&#39;ve been seeing the excellent reviews pop up on Yelp for a few months now. *sigh* I didn&#39;t like it, and man I wanted to like it. I got the baked chicken (it was just kinda wet and slimy and the flavor didn&#39;t wow me at all), mac and cheese (mostly bubbly cheese, which tasted alright but too much for my guts), garlic bread (overwhelmingly garlic-y), honey mustard (not the best but also alright), and sweet chili (blech). <br><br>I am NOT a picky eater, but this was just a bummer. Maybe the fried strips are better? Maybe I should have tried the wasabi sauce people rave about? I don&#39;t know... Money is tight these days, so if I&#39;m going out for lunch it better be good. I won&#39;t be rushing back for sure.<br><br>The best things about the place? Fanta in bottles (which I noticed AFTER I ordered) and the very friendly service. They have that down to a science!	0
This was our first trip to Units. Great food and service. Everyone was very friendly, from the hostess who sat us to the owner who stopped by our table to thank us and ask for any suggestions on how they can make the experience even better. Our server was very helpful in guiding us through the menu and provided us a few suggestions (salami and sausage flatbread and most of our sides) that were all awesome. Unite is a treasure for this part of the neighborhood. I&#39;ll be back on a regular basis.	1
Beef cheeks rock! Nice selection of wines by the glass	1
I think Roy Choi is following me. Every time I&#39;m in one of his restaurants he&#39;s there too. Plus, this one time he asked to take a picture with me. Obviously he&#39;s a big fan... ;)<br><br>I have been wanting to try Pot for a very long time. I&#39;m so glad we finally made it out here. We&#39;ll be coming back soon, for sure. <br><br>The whole experience (and it is an experience) was a total blast. The staff was fun and enthusiastic and laughed at all my jokes. The walls had flowers in them. The table had little cubbies for spoons and such. It was a totally rad lunch all around. <br><br>We ordered enough food for many meals. In fact, we ate lunch, and then we had leftovers for dinner, and lunch the next day. Yum.<br><br>Started with drinks. I had the curry soju. I&#39;m not usually a soju person but this was really unique and fun. I&#39;d be interested in trying the kimchi one sometime. <br><br>First came the dumplings. Very gorgeous. Very tasty. I would get these again.<br><br>Then the uni rice. Guys, I can&#39;t tell you enough how amazing this was. I told Chris that I felt like I was absorbing many worlds and cultures with my tastebuds. I have no idea what that could even mean but I&#39;m serious. It&#39;s that good. It&#39;s rich and full and perfect. I can&#39;t wait to have it again. Every day... forever.<br><br>We also ordered the bootknocker hotpot. We received the shorty hotpot. Which was still very delicious but I can&#39;t wait to come back and try the bootknocker. We ordered a small and it was still quite big. I&#39;d say it could feed at least four, especially with other things on the table. I really enjoyed the dates in it. Perfect match with the fatty, rich meat. And it all reheated well.<br><br>Our bill had the price of the shorty hotpot on it and that was $10 more than the bootknocker. So, I asked if we could have the $10 off since I didn&#39;t order that dish to begin with. Our waiter was kind enough to oblige. Which I appreciated since it was still roughly an eighty dollar lunch. Yikes!<br><br>Chego is still my favorite Roy Choi restaurant. But I&#39;m definitely devoted to this man&#39;s cuisine. From A-Frame to Sunny Spot to Pot - he always makes my tummy super happy. Thanks for keeping it up Roy; I can&#39;t wait for the next one.	1
Pisillo is a great neighborhood Italian sandwich place that uses fresh, authentic ingredients. While I have been here several times in the past, most recently I visited during the Snowpocalypse(fail) of 2015. <br><br>I decided to indulge in the Pisillo panini (#26), which was about $2 more expensive than most of their offerings. It, like all of their other sandwiches I&#39;ve tried (Roma, Trento, and Perugia), did not disappoint: about 14 inches of crusty bread stuffed with the perfect proportion of delicate prosciutto di Parma, tender porchetta (yes, double meat- just the way I like it), milky mozzarella di bufala, roasted peppers, arugula, and balsamic dressing. <br><br>I intended to eat half and save the other half for a snow day breakfast/lunch...obviously, that did not happen. Fell into a deep, deep food coma shortly thereafter and did not gain consciousness for several hours- worth it! <br><br>Note: While the menu says &#34;panini,&#34; none of the sandwiches are pressed/grilled (&#34;panini&#34; in Italian simply means &#34;bread roll&#34;). Also, cash only- though you can get around that by ordering it on Seamless and selecting &#34;pick up.&#34;	1
We have dined at Bistro9 many times and have never been disappointed. The food is always wonderful, as is the service and setting!We both ordered fish entrees and they were very good.	1
I've given them to many tries to upgrade their service, but last week was the final straw. Knowing it's best to call in for your order, since it will take 30+ minutes to finally get it, I called first thing in the morning at 8:30, the person who picked up the phone, just answered by his NAME, not the name of the Restaurant, but by his name, than asked for me to HOLD. Okay... so I waited and when he came back on, he said, what can I do for you, I replied " IS THIS THE WOOD?", I was so caught off guard with his customer service.I gave them 20 minutes, even though I know they just opened, my food was ready and the total was $9.65, WOW, expensive for a breakfast burrito, handed him a $10.00 bill, the kicker was when the dude says " I don't have any change", not that I bitching about 35 cents, but the fact they had NO COIN CHANGE in their drawer was hillarious. I would love to see what he would of said if I gave him a $20.00 bill.	0
Every single time I come to Madison, WI I cannot wait to get here on Saturday morning! The have literally some of the yummiest breakfast I've ever had, EVER!!	0
Amazing. Food was great and the staff was so kind and attentive. Highly recommend it.	1
Yes, LA Cafe is slightly over priced and if you chose to eat on their patio chances are you will get harassed by the homeless but their food is quite tasty. Its really the only place in downtown that's open nearly all the time w/ the exception of when they clean the kitchen which is sometime between 5&6 - not 100% sure.. Food wise- Breakfast dishes are good, the Shanghai & Farmers Market salads are fresh and delicious, The Caprese Paninis is possibly one of my favorites, the Sliders, Veggie & Big Cheeseburger are very juicy; the Assorted Veggies & Mashed Potatoes (even though 7.99 is too too much for it) along with the Tomato Basil soup and grilled cheese (which are my absolute favorite) are the closest thing to Vegetarian on the menu... w/ the exception of the Pesto Veggie which is quite gross.. the amount of pesto is just overwhelming. The assorted pastries always hit the spot. So even though it is pricey you will find something you like.As far as service and delivery... well its not the Four Seasons and as long as you keep that in mind it's fine.. it could be a lot worse. If they only had more space.	1
For what they offer they are really good. We had mahi curry and creamy soup. Both tasty delicious. They have few tables . Most people take out. They has this Brooklyn hipster vibe and food philosophy in the place and the food. Most foods even in places that advertise themselves as healthy taste taste to some degree unhealthy salty. No exception here! I find the food a bit salty. Above what level of being considered healthy. But it could be just me. If you want a quick fix of reliable, not over priced food in there area with no frills , this is the place.	1
New KoMex location. Same very delicious KoMex food. <br><br>If you haven&#39;t tried KoMex yet get down to this location or the original location ASAP. I hated the long almost 1 hr waits at the other location on some days. Yes it&#39;s that good. So I&#39;m very happy this one finally opened up. Korean Mexican fusion is an excellent combination. I ordered their Fusion Burrito, my usual order, and inhaled that sucker like I was in a pie eating contest. Why waste time eating 1 yummy thing when I could eat 2 yummy things, didn&#39;t do 2 but wanted to. The one thing that you must do is add lots and lots of their hot sauces on anything you get it&#39;s a big difference maker but in moderations. I almost ate all 4 of the containers of sauce on my own. It&#39;s very good. They should bottle them cause I might want to take some home.<br><br>Their fusion tacos, burritos, nachos, fries, etc are served with various meats like spicy pork, pork belly, chicken, and more all come with a Korean/Mexican twist. Even their cheese steak was different, using bulgogi. Check out the pictures and reviews at the original location it will pretty much tell you wassup.<br><br>I enjoyed the customer service friendly, complementary chips, salsa, guacamole, fortune cookies, and oranges to end the meal. They were still finishing up construction and decorating, fine tuning things like only cash at the time, 1 out of the 6 menu books at our table was without a menu inside, and temp banner outside but things are looking good. Seems like more space for more seats and even a bar area. I&#39;ll probably be back before the weeks over. No I will definitely be back before the weeks over.<br><br>Located in the same plaza as BabyStacks Cafe and Hikari SW Buffalo and Flamingo.<br><br>Did I mention that they&#39;re pretty cheap in price.	1
kale/pumpkin salad, spaghetti with a simple tomato sauce, a glass of red and I was happy as can be!	1
The good: nothingThe bad: 1) clueless and slow server who served little neck clams at the END of our meal2) the clams contained sands which were good for those who wanted some teeth polishing with the sands3) tasteless food with small portions - in fact, costco sampler on sundays is likely better way to enjoy same portion meal We tried to find the silver lining from this horrible place. And we failed. Fresh crab mac& cheese sounded very delicious and it turned out to be bland. Combo Louie sounded fresh & yummy and it ended up being boring like aged mcdonald salad. Shoestring fries maybe semi decent but mcdonald probably has better value proposition.All and all, a place that no one should ever visited. Ever.	0
Totally empty on a Wednesday night at 8. Staff and owner very sweet but food not very good. We had empanadas/ gaucamole, the tamal with lobstrt , quinoia risotto and tostadas. The tostadas were especially bland and greasy. The rest was just ok and overpriced.	0
New manager = vast improvement. They might invest in a sign though?	1
Oh my god it is not describable how corrupt and horrible that restaurant and everyone that worked for it was.	0
People make your business. Stop studying your books. You are your people. Good job Camille.	1
We went to Biaggi's with a family group of seven celebrate two birthdays on an early Sunday evening. The place was mostly empty when we arrived. We stopped at the bar while we waited for the rest of our party to arrive and ordered two drinks. It took more than ten minutes to get the drinks as the bartender excused himself right after we ordered to bring a take out order to someone who had just arrived.	0
A charming little place in the heart of Federal Hill. With a seasonal menu, and a modest yet appropriate beverage list, there's something for everyone. They serve about 5-00 draft beers, but my favorite &quot;beer&quot; on the menu is the hard root beer-- a childhood favorite in adult form :). They also have wines by the bottle and glass however the house red is a great deal and good for sharing if you order the carafe. The risotto fritters are an absolute favorite small plate, along with the butternut squash soup and brussel sprout salad. They also make a solid crab cake. Entrees are moderately priced ranging from 08-30 and are quite delicious. MY boyfriend ordered the swordfish last time and has also had their steak. Both times he was impressed. You can certainly get away with ordering a number of small plates or an entree, depending on your mood. The atmosphere is always relaxed yet vibrant at the same time. Staff is super friendly and attentive. I always leave there happy. Good for dates.	0
I had lunch with some girlfriends at table Thai. The place is cute cozy and very clean. I loved how all the Thai tea and Thai coffee were served in mason jars. Everything we ordered tasted very good! And the staff was very friendly and the service was quick. We will definitely be back soon. <br><br>Must order the soft shell crab panang! And the the girls also loved the curry lamb chops!	1
Super fun event! There&#39;s a large variety of options for everyone! We ended up getting the burnt end nachos from mexicue which was a fantastic size portion to share. <br><br>We also got smoked Gouda Mac and cheese - super creamy but it wasn&#39;t my favorite	1
The manager/host guy thinks it&#39;s cool to try to SMASH TO DEATH rats with the heel of his boot. If you are opposed to inhumane behavior, that&#39;s a turn off. If you don&#39;t care about rats, I still assume you don&#39;t want a rat&#39;s skull exploding inches away from your plate of food. Seriously, dude, what would have happened if you had successfully stomped on that rat? How was that gonna go?<br><br>I&#39;ve had decent (but decidedly overrated) food here on a handful of occasions. If you want to live in a Portlandia sketch where people congregate around waiting an hour for a brunch table, this is it. I know vegetarians consider this place a good option, but be aware that the staff doesn&#39;t give a shit about animal-related morals.	0
Great happy hour and great music. <br>I like that it&#39;s mostly outdoors. The lighting and the picnic tables = cool cool cool	1
My boyfriend and I went out to get some late night ramen in WeHo. We had heard about Urban Ramen from some friends and decided to give it a try. I'm glad we did! The restaurant had a small interior with three big screen TVs playing Howl's Moving Castle (already winning me over). The menu had a pretty decent selection, with a ton of ways you could modify the ramen bowls to your taste. Our waiter was so kind and attentive; he made sure we knew about their options and favorites. I went with the veggie ramen and my boyfriend got the spicy chicken. Both bowls came out stacked with colorful, fresh ingredients. It was sooo good! I had enough to take home and eat for lunch the next day. It's a five minute walk from my place, so this will definitely be somewhere I go back to!	1
I have nothing new to offer when it comes to a review of this place. It really is as good as everybody says. The sandwiches are excellent. The pork is tender and tasty. There is more than enough food to satisfy even the heartiest appetites. I happened to go on a day when the line was totally manageable. The people working there were helpful. There are tables inside, but it is a bit cramped.	0
This is my spot for fast, fresh and tasty burritos and quesadillas. You order the meat you would like and then select how you would like to eat it. For instance, you may order steak then you select between a burrito, tacos, taco bowl salad, or a quesadilla. Next you select the toppings and lastly you pig out and then feel lethargic for the rest of the day. It is simply comfort food in a tortilla. The ingredients are always fresh. They always grill your meat in front of you and for the love of God try the queso dipping sauce. I can guarantee that you will have a great meal. The one I usually go to is off of 137th ave and sw 152 st. The staff is friendly and quick. The bird road location seems like they are always understaffed prepare to wait 20 minutes for your food. Other than that this place is a safe bet my fellow yelpers. Andale andale arriba!!!!	1
Started well, seated promptly.   The server Joe, was right there.   Water and bread arrived. zippy.  Placed our orders.Caesars salad was fine  .Friend's onion soup outstanding.  The rib steak to die for, and the cow died.    Yams and asparagus was fine.Friends lamb chops were eaten down to the bone.  The new York looked perectly cooked.  All we well for all of us.	1
Undercooked pasta and burnt pizza. Expected more.	0
Well I know that memories are something you will have to develop on your own but it wont take long.	1
OK, the parentals came up from Southern Cal for a visit on the way up to Salt Lake. They wanted something quick to eat but not fast food (you know, the Taco Bell / Burger King crap). I recommended Abuelas since its down the street from the house. They said OK. <br><br>(Now just a primer here -- My dad is a semi-quasi professional chef (has pro training but just uses it at the house) and a very finicky palate - junk food just doesn&#39;t cut it. My mom likes the finer things in life but will eat Taco Bell and such if forced)<br><br>So we arrive on Taco Tuesday around 3p, a few people inside. Pops was kind of thrown off by the walk up and order from the counter (as he is a menu and full catering type), but the lady by the counter was extremely friendly and had Dad communicating. Mom was in awe that the gal in the back was actually hand pressing home made tortillas. The order was 2 carne asada burrito plates (me &amp; pops) and mom gets 2 carne asada tacos, chips/salsa &amp; side of guac.<br><br>Mom&#39;s easy, plows into the tacos. Loves it. Loves the pico salsa that comes with the chips, liked the green hot sauce but didn&#39;t care for the red thicker hot sauce. Guac was good, real avocados but not much else, no problem. Roasted pepper devoured. <br><br>Dad kinda picks at the plate at first and I think, ut oh. Then he says the beans and meat are very good and well seasoned. Hurray I didn&#39;t disappoint the pops. Ate everything but the grilled green onion (I stole that). Didn&#39;t care for the rice and chips much, but as he says, those are fillers and he thought the chip salsa was good but a tad too much salt. Overall - he was impressed and said he would return if/when they come back out. After 2 hours ago of Abuela&#39;s dining and chatting about stuff &amp; life, it turned out to be a real pleasant afternoon. Thanks Abuela&#39;s.	1
A couple co-workers and I decided to check this place out after work, and it did not disappoint. The ambience and decor were cute. The cocktails we ordered were all fantastic, and the shared plates we ordered were delicious. The only thing we did not enjoy was the small wine pours so I&#39;d recommend ordering one of their cocktails or beers instead of the wines. Our favorite dishes were the fried cauliflower and reignette - highly recommend them!<br><br>The hostess was also super delightful and proactive - when she saw that one of co-workers was a little cold, she moved us to a seat that was in a warmer part of the dining area.	1
An acquaintance recommended Glo's restaurant and warned us there would be a wait. We waited for 45 minutes for a BAD table (right next to the restrooms) and then waited another 30 minutes to get our order taken. It was packed and loud. 	0
I&#39;m a native NYer with a very high bar for food and service. 5/5 starts for service, food, and decor<br><br>i went there a couple of weeks ago with two friends. Each course was better than the last. Our meal included: great appetizers, wines paired perfectly (with help from the waitress), delicious entrees, and a dessert that left you wanting more, despite not being able to eat another crumb I was so full. <br><br>Don&#39;t take my word for it - go!	1
Where is the love? This is the most heartless place in LA.The hostess is very rude, servers somewhat rude and the foodWas not bad but no finesse. This place will fall soon because it has no depth or class.Tip, if the c***t hostess says she needs the table back by 7:30 ignore her. She says it to everyone! This restaurant must lose so much money because they are busy pushing people out the door.Not a dinning experience I would recommend.	0
Ew. Cardboard flavored beef in there sul lung tang. Everytime I go, i get the sul lung tang hoping it'll taste better than the last time... Why I keep doing that is a mystery to me. Broth isn't all that great either. You'd be better off with other things in the menu. I'm giving it 2 stars for the rice tho. It comes in a dolsot (stone pot). Just go to Hanbat.	0
Pretty place located in Brooklyn. Once you enter, you get the intense smell of the kitchen--something I didn&#39;t like. They need some ventilation.<br><br>To start, we had some cocktails. The crimson sour was the star of the table with its sweet yet sour undertones. I had the Counter Culture that had walnut and stirred with coffee beans. I was satisfied with the drink--it was very interesting.<br><br>We shared the beet salad--which was good. Some beets, pistachio, ricotta cheese--this had a great mix of flavors and textures. We ended up sharing steak frites--this was disappointing. For $24 we had steak, fries, and a side salad basically. The steak, the star of the plate, was chewy and plain. The fries, were just--fries. This was a steak and fries plate. I was expecting maybe a sauce on the side (they did) but it was just steak sauce. This was not worth getting at all. The service was okay but I wouldn&#39;t return to this place.	0
This place is awesome. I&#39;m officially making myself a regular! Nate, my waiter, was so attentive, helpful, and friendly and he made my experience here amazing! I love the vibe here and the service and draft beers are definitely above par! This place made me feel like I was family!	1
Don&#39;t ever come here with only two people. This hole in the ground can not accommodate more that 2 two person parties at a specific time. Why can&#39;t 2 people sit at a 4 person table? The wait is incredibly long and disrespectful when there are so many tables leaving and coming.	0
I really liked everything about this place. The alcohol selection, the decor, the service, even the open view of the kitchen for such a tiny space. My first dining stop on my trip to Seattle. Would definitely return someday.	0
I visited Fred 62 before I moved to LA, and I'll tell you, it made me feel like if LA can have a diner like this, then LA must be a great place to live! .... The menu is huge, the American fare creative & delicious, the portions generous, the prices great, the service top-notch, the retro booths edgy. What I especially love is that the servers and fellow customers seem cool, like folks you'd like to know. Plus it's open 24/7. And a convenient location, pretty close to downtown Hollywood.... I love love love Fred 62, and you will, too!	1
I assume this place is better for breakfast but it&#39;s called Breakfast Lunch Dinner...<br><br>Dinner was meh. Parking sucked majorly. All the streets around were filled or had some restriction or another and I didn&#39;t wanna valet cause I suck. I mean they suck.<br><br>Went for DineLA and got served portions for ants. I don&#39;t think anyone left full though we left $35 poorer..<br><br>The portions weren&#39;t big and weren&#39;t that tasty. The crab falafel tasted strange. You can&#39;t go wrong with bacon wrapped pork tenderloin but it was tiny!<br><br>I might come again, only for breakfast!	0
The food seems confused and I'm not a big fan of the concept. My rice bowl had an overpowering mayonnaise-like sauce, which was odd for the dish. My other half got a noodle bowl which had a heavy sauce as well. I will say the XLB were pretty good. The decor and vibe while trying to be Asian street just seem muddled.	0
Our first time here and we will definitely come back to try other sandwiches on the menu. It&#39;s a small sandwich shop but the owner and servers are friendly and helpful. Prices are reasonable for the size of the sandwiches. We got the Italian and grace Lucia both on Dutch Crunch. The ingredients were fresh and scrumptious. Both sandwiches were delicious to bring us back. Definitely the best sandwich shop in Vegas.	1
I'm not the hugest fan of the service here. I always feel like I'm either rushed to eat, or on their slower times, like I have to always try to get their attention to remind them of little things like drinks/refills/a plate/etc.With all that said, they probably have the BEST chicken fried rice anywhere. What makes their chicken fried rice so amazing is the sweet taste the rice carries. If you've had it before, you know exactly what I'm talking about. I feel like the sauce used to dip the bbq chicken only adds to the flavor of the rice(so maybe they cook the rice with some of their sauce?). Whatever it is please don't change your recipe. Their rice is sooo good that you can even refrigerate it and eat it cold and it will still be amazing! I think it might actually even taste better cold, because the hotness doesn't get in the way of tasting the rice for what it is.	1
2 house of the rising sun burgers with egg, one black Betty, one garlic Parmesan fries and blue cheese fries, nice little baskets (the baskets could be a little bigger), family owned, attentive staff and you can sense they need the tables so don&#39;t plan on lounging around. Posters of the Beatles and Led Zeppelin were cool. A little pricey and nothing left over to take home, which may imply that the fries serving size could be 33% bigger. Note: this restaurant as well as others like Burger Philosophy are taking fries to a whole new level, to the point where it&#39;s becoming the main highlight of the meal. Society has come a long way from McDonald&#39;s fries and our expectations will never be the same. Despite my minor critiques, this place certainly has the swagger.	1
Blonde bartender working on new years eve VERY rude! It's like she hates the people she's serving.	0
chef creole is undoubtedly an institution in little haiti, however this place is not only loved by the haitian community but by anyone and everyone who knows whats up like wyclef jean, dwyane wade, chris tucker and other badasses. service could be a bit more upbeat, considering how happy, picturesque and charming this place is. you cant miss its location. its right on the corner of 2nd avenue NW and 54 street. <br><br>im a big fan of their fried conch special which comes with two sides. i normally get the rice &amp; beans and plantains but they also have conch salad, conch fritters, white rice, etc. prices are great and they do have some amazing specials like shrimp creole for only $5 but on wednesdays, but only from 6pm to 8pm. <br><br>so now you know whats up.	1
Really enjoyed Alchemy. Went with my girlfriend and thought it was a great spot for a date but I think it would be great for groups. We were seated right away on a Saturday night and the service was really good. Beer selection was good, cocktails were really good, and the wings are incredible. Loved the cheese on them and they had the right amount of heat.	0
My good friend recommended Perch for my 30th Birthday because I was looking for a venue that had a good balance between young and mature; trendy and cultivate; quirky and unassuming; busy and quiet setting all in one place! I can't believe I found it!!! I spent so long trying to research a few places in DTLA, Hollywood, Silverlake, Westside, etc for the right restaurant/lounge and Perch was wonderful. I was so happy to find a place with good food, great service, awesome music, and not to mention a beautiful view. My birthday was on a Thursday this year so the place was quiet, but I heard that it can get very busy during the weekend. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to spend their special occasion at very special venue.	1
Went here with a couple of friends a couple months ago. Cute restaurant, heard it was voted as one of the most romantic date places in the LA area? <br>We sat outside in this kind of &#39;hut&#39;-shaped thing...they had Christmas lights around it which always helps make things cute. It&#39;s a very natural looking place...but the outdoor seating was a bit uncomfortable because all the tables were close to each other (why do fancy restaurants always seem to do this?) which made it really for the cocktail effect to come into play. (I know, eavesdropping on other people&#39;s conversations are wrong..but so fun!)<br><br>the food, like what most people seem to be saying is okay.. nothing spectacular... I say it&#39;s pretty pricey for what you get. Oh well, what isn&#39;t overpriced nowadays? <br><br>BUT. the reason I am writing this review... is because they have the BEST DESSERT EVER. Seriously. It was freaking delicious and it just melted in my mouth...and left me, craving for more and more. It was the chocolate pot de creme! SO GOOD. but, it just might be me. and my love for dark chocolate...<br>but yeah, that&#39;s basically the reason I gave this place 4 stars. <br><br>Service is pretty bad, the servers aren&#39;t attentive, the way the restaurant is set up makes me a bit claustrophobic and uneasy. but the CHOCOLATE POT DE CREME! so good. remember that.	1
Incredible fresh noodles and vegetarian options including some form of homemade seitan!!! NOM!!	1
A whole new perspective (literally and figuratively) on the LA Scene. Views were amazing, giving the most beautiful sunset sight in a long time. Hip, sexy and friendly people. Went on a Friday night, got a cabana and celebrated a birthday. Very accommodating staff ;-) I recommend the dark &amp; stormy mule ;-) delicious!	1
This is a find.Comprehensive menu that serves breakfast all day, a solid and diverse sandwich section that doesn't skimp on the ingredients, a few dinner plates, some korean/japanese dishes, a south of the border section and some tasty desserts. As noted, it caters to the hipster/los feliz crowd. I am not into the scene but didn't really care. The decor and style gives nod to a 50's diner but with more of an updated feel. I had the BLT with avocado that hit the spot. Because of the size of the menu, I can imagine some dishes are hit or miss but this is a spot to come to when you know what to order. I also decided to try out the peanut butter milkshake and that sealed the deal. It was one of the better shakes I've had in LA.This is a definite go to if you are in the area. Lots of variety, open late, relaxed atmosphere and you can find something that will hit the spot.	1
This is a good place to go if you want to pay exorbitant prices and have your activities curtailed. No laptops are allowed at most of the tables (though cell phones are apparently welcome). Overpriced by a mile. I paid $3 for a cup of decaf - and they wouldn&#39;t give me a refill. The pastries didn&#39;t have prices listed because if you have to ask, you can&#39;t afford it. Mostly, though, I disliked having my activities dictated. If they only want me to sit there a limited time, fine, but don&#39;t tell me what I can do once I take a seat. My use of a laptop doesn&#39;t harm anybody.	0
Atmosphere: Small, dark, private if the place isn't packed. Service: Pretty quick. Food: Really good burgers. Price: Average.Would I go back? Yes.	1
This place is AWESOME!!!! I love it! The burgers are delicious and the atmosphere is so amazing. Its like going back into a time capsule to West LA in the 1940's. This is another example of a restaurant that does a few things very, very well. Burger, milkshake and a piece of apple pie! Check it out!	1
11am and I counted about 25 people in line....and did I see that they only have 1 cash register going? <br><br>Ain&#39;t nobody got time for that.	0
I don't like this place anymore.So many things have changed...-You can only order two things at a time..whether it be water, meat, sides, etc.Guess the servers are having too much trouble remembering the orders(not like they get it right with two things to remember anyway).This might work for a party of two but anything bigger than thatexpect to be hungry because they bring out the same portion whether you're a party of 2 or 5.-Their lunch box which was my fave now has anchovies instead of spam(which btw is still pretty delish).-The servers are nowhere to be found. More than half the time we were sitting there sucking on our chopsticks.And when we get one of their attention, they're walking away as they're taking our order.. wtf is the hurry?-Noob servers..Please don't flip my meat when it's not ready to be flipped!!!This one girl made our meat into a rag since she forced that thing off the grill when it wasn't ready (fyi meat will fall off nicely when it's ready to be flipped)Sad to say..since I always suggested this place when meeting up with people wanting AYCE KBBQ..but not anymore.Bye KogiKingI will not return (or any of my friends) unless you guys get rid of that "you can only order 2 things at a time" policy because that's stupid.	0
Terrible service! Bad food! Overall one of the worst experiences! We waited for our food for 1 hour, inquired about it several times and only after attempt#3 the waiter came up to our table and explained that they were short staffed.. When finally my burger arrived, the patty was burnt and of course dry! My bf's plate came 10 mins later... Would never recommend this place!	0
I haven't had an opportunity to eat much of the food yet, but the drinks, service, and ambiance are exemplary at Witness.	1
I was excited to try a different BBQ place in Brooklyn. Despite having exceptional brisket everything else was overly peppery and underwhelming. The most awful baked beans and macaroni and cheese. The potato salad was too vinegary. Although there is plenty of room to sit inside and enjoy a show the food must be good. And this left me with a bad taste in my mouth. Plus it was far too pricey for mediocre bbq. Sticking with Fette Sau.	0
A hidden gem. Great food. Brian and Randy are great. Wonderful atmosphere. Get the chocolate cake for dessert. You&#39;ll thank me later.	1
I&#39;m not sure if I just went on a good day but if they stay consistent this is the best Nica food i&#39;ve had in a while. I ordered carne asada, gallopinto, maduros and fried cheese, enjoyed every bite. Will definitely go back and most certainly recommend!	1
This place was overcrowded. The employees were not too friendly. Our server was quite rude. I will not be returning to this place, ever. The drinks were good, but the customer service was a total turn off.	0
Went there and was very impressed by decor ! I had the porterhouse steak, it was the best ! The lamb burger was kick ass plus the duck bread melted in my mouth and the truffle fries , well like the day in Brooklyn &#39;forget about it ; they were amazing we drove from Philly to eat here then drive back the same night and the mini pastry and ohhh my god the best risotto I ever tasted in my life !!!!!! We will be back again real soon ! Highly recommend .- and we can&#39;t wait to go back	1
Love the atmosphere the waiters are great and the steaks are excellent as well.	1
Worst Penne Arribiatta ever, tons of anchovies, all I could taste was anchovies and salt, the dish had no balance. No one greets you at the door. Better food at the Noodles chain across the street.	0
Just another night looking for something of Asian decent, so we was to inner Richmond hoping to get lucky.Halu... Closed...FML...Does not want Pho...Does not want K.BBQ...Genki Ramen? Ehh associated with the little convenience store? Why not...So we park right out front and step right in.God damnit it's loud in here, especially with bad top 40.We take a seat and glance through the menu and find some good items here: ^ yakitori, ramen, okonomiyaki.Bad, Bad, BAD!No Japanese here, all Chinese? Service was nonexistent. And blech...Don't go here... Please just stay away...Tanpopo is seriously not far away.It makes me cry!	0
I wouldn't say I loved or hated this place I would just say that my experience at Monkey Bridge was just mediocre. The food was okay but I was not overly impressed with my clay pot pork. I would give it one more try but I do not think I will be raving about this place to anyone!	0
Wow. After searching for a year, I've finally found it. A place that has Hitachino on draft!The Far Bar is located in Japantown between two buildings. It's a pretty cool layout, but since it's a little narrow, it does get packed at times. Luckily, as with all places, if you come early enough, you can get seats and chill. I know this place does serve tapas, but when I came here with friends, we just straight went to the alcohol menu. Seemed like a great time to have an alcohol dinner. What's pretty cool about sitting outside is that there's a fat projection screen there that's showing sporting events while it's life. Thus, we got to watch the NBA Playoffs while drinking. For drinks, they have a pretty extensive beer and drink list. The waitress literally gave us 4 separate drink menus, each with different things on it. The Hitachino white ale was $10 a glass which was actually pretty reasonable. Just that alone, and I'm a happy camper. Aside from that, the other beers are pretty reasonably priced at around $5-$10.At night, this place does have a DJ so if that's a little loud for you, there is an inside bar as well. This place probably has the best alcohol selection in Japantown, so if you're looking to grab a drink, this place is for you.	1

Quick and porky. If the big bad wolf had one of these burgers he would of blow that brick house for just one more bite.	1
I hope you know how to point and smile because if you don&#39;t know Spanish here, you may be doing a lot of pointing and smiling. Luckily for me, I know how to use both of my hands, so I pointed at some arroz imperial, got a huge brick of yellow rice with cheese on it, and smiled as I paid $4.85 for a huge dish.<br><br>Huge plusses: The food here is delicious, and all of it is on display, so you know what you get. There are also lots of spaces for sitting. Everything here is also very inexpensive.<br><br>Even better ifs: If you don&#39;t know Spanish, you may get lost here, so bring a friend, or learn how to point and smile. The parking lot is also small, so it&#39;s a hassle to park here.<br><br>Random reflection: This place is Cuban central--the ideal place to learn Spanish.	1
Funky vibe $2 mimosas one of my favorite morning joints	1
I used to love having lunch at the Westville branch in the West Village when I worked in that area, but the East Side version pales in comparison. <br><br>First off, our waiter literally poured a cup of coffee onto my friend&#39;s phone. I get that accidents happen, but shortly after he dumped 12 ounces of liquid onto my pal&#39;s electronics, the waiter told my friend he was at fault. The waiter who helped clean the coffee off the table was really, really nice and apologetic in a way that the coffee-pourer was not.<br><br>As for the food, the zucchini, tomatoes, and mozzarella we ordered were excellent, but the poached salmon sandwich was just gross. When it arrived, the whole thing, bread and all, was very wet. The salmon was kind of mushy and flavorless, but the salad that came with it was very good. <br><br>Our kind of snotty hipster waitress (we had like 3 people waiting on us while we were there) took so long to get us our utensils that my friend went up to the tray and took them himself. Then, when he ordered dessert, she got the order wrong and, when confronted about it, told him to eat the one she had brought anyway, because getting the right dessert would take a while and the one she brought was good anyway. <br><br>So, you know, if you&#39;re looking for some good vegetables and attractive people to look at, this place is fine. If you want forks or to leave with an iPhone that isn&#39;t ruined, you should probably go elsewhere.	0
I really, really want to like Brickhouse BBQ due to its downtown location, nice and spacious interior, and fantastic-looking rooftop patio.	0
Great service. They have my favorite zin here. Sangrias are the best I've had. Food is great! Everything on the HH menu is totally yummy. Bartender challenged me to find better nachos in town I haven't been able to yet....	1
yes a little loud, probably best for parties of two but not that big of a deal. service was good. the escolar crudo was amazing and loved the fusilli with clams and smoked butter. yes the food was rich and intensely flavored, but that's a good thing when you are sharing small plates. all you need are a few bites of deliciousness, not sure why people are complaining about that. if it was in my neighborhood i would go more often.	1
Considering I don't eat meat, you'd think I would never hit up a place like Canter's. But with a Jewish husband I find myself here quite often. Especially when we have friends in town. Particularly of the NY Jew variety. So we go. I get a grilled cheese and fries. I always want to love their pickles. But I just don't. It bums me out every time. But I keep going back. It's for the ambiance. And the Atomic Horseradish.	1
Was on the Eater 38 list so we decided to try it with a few foodie friends. Very disappointing, easily the worst ROI restaurant I've ever been to. We had the tasting menu and absolutely nothing was good. The dishes sounded interesting but they just didn't work, which is absolutely unacceptable for a place this expensive. I would say avoid like the plague but the plague is way more cost-effective (I gave the plague 2 stars).	0
I had a really bad experience here. We waited 45 minutes for a table and I was treated very poorly by a waitress while waiting. I asked if they had any beer in bottles and she replied &#34;we&#39;re not that kind of place!&#34; In a very rude tone. <br><br>The fries are great. The bathroom was dark, dirty and scary. The ambiance is cute, but the staff is very pretentious and alienating. Drinks are overpriced.<br><br>I had heard that Au Cheval served &#34;the best burgers in Chicago&#34; and got nothing that was even close to being a &#34;best burger.&#34; Do not order the side of pickles, gross and waste of money. The burger are enormous, but size does not equal quality. If you order a single you get two patties. If you order bacon you get the thickest slices of bacon that I&#39;ve seen, but this is just a super size average burger. Unless you are the type of person that is into slopping large amount of food down their throat and don&#39;t really care about taste, you should avoid this place.	0
Dining at Commissary feels both sophisticated AND lighthearted at the same time... The location is obviously very lovely, but the food, service, and nighttime atmosphere all enlighten the experience even more. During our visit, we felt impressed by EVERY dish we ordered, in LOVE with all the workers, and very happy to be in the restaurant that night. In regards to many of the previous careless comments for the menu & ordering style, they have recently assumed a new approach to this process. The menu no longer comes in a set of listing & key, but instead just the single sheet of pictures & their names alone. When ordering, you are encouraged to take a chance on each item (not knowing exactly what you will be given, aside from one small print)... which is actually a very fun way to be served and perhaps what food ordering (and life) should always be like :P Once you eat here, you will fall in love w/ the owner, building, & food, as well as the people you came with. It's so so perfect~They have also just added breakfast & lunch, in the daytime, to their service :') I would love to go back	1
Very ExpensiveCreepy and awkward waitstaffMediocre Food	0
Let me begin by saying, the lobster grilled cheese! (drool) One of my favorite locations to hit up in Downtown Los Angeles after a nice long bike ride around the city. This place is simply great for any ocaasion meeting friends, a date, quick munch or really intoxicated type hunger!	1
I've been to AQ 6 times now. 4 times for dinner, spanning 3 menus (winter, spring, summer), and 2 times for drinks (spring, summer).I really want to like it. Unfortunately, AQ does not live up to the hype or price. There are three major problems: service, food taste, and food execution.Service:The service is atrocious for a restaurant of this caliber. Dinner there last week involved a 20 minute wait after being seated to be graced by the server's presence, another 20 minute wait to receive the bottle of champagne we ordered, the server giving us attitude (for lack of a better descriptor) throughout the meal, no description of the menu or recommendations, all while other servers gabbed with their friends who happened to be dining in the restaurant. At least the floor captain apologized at the end of the night.I would love to say that this was a one-time occurrence, but every experience has been similar. One evening of drinks at the bar was met with another rude bartender who would not acknowledge us for 15 minutes after we sat down (not even a "Hi I'm a bit busy I'll be with you soon"), and when my friend asked what drinks she liked, she replied "Every drink is good. Why would we put a bad drink on the menu."Food Taste:While the menu looks enticing, and the combinations are innovative, the flavor has been zapped out of the food. There is no dish that is bad, and every dish is visually stunning, but few excite the taste buds.Food Execution:Finished dishes are left in the pickup area far too long, and warm dishes get cold. On one visit, we sat next to the pickup area and witnessed the poor coordination and pileup of dishes. This helped explain why meat and fish were consistently served lukewarm to cold.	0
I like it very much it was a a quiet and quaint little place I personally had the Thai fried rice with beef spicy and it was very good I enjoy your very much and my partner has spicy basil chicken and I also tried that and I liked it too the host was very nice and took very good care of us from the outside it looks like a little hole in the wall restaurant and it is a very enjoyable place on the inside quiet and peaceful	1
One word - Vodkatorium.	0
I like this place. The tacos are innovative and in my opinion worth the extra couple bucks. It&#39;s biggest downfall will probably be its location. There&#39;s a lot of traditional Mexican restaurants there that people have a tradition of going too. They may want to tone down some of there verbiage too. Words like fabricators don&#39;t go down well in Sikverlake.	1
Beat Hotel continues to be a great dining choice in harvard Sq.  The menu has changed somewhat since it opened but still reliably good food and drinks.  Service is very good, attentive and helpful. Definitely worth a visit!	1
Copy cat idea from Boiling Crab in Southern California and Hot N Juicy Crawfish in Las Vegas. The sauce here is no where even close to being as good as either of the west coast originals. I mean, really, not even close. The sauce is rather bland, even at the spicy level. Clams are terrible. They are huge, not the little neck clams that should be used. These big ass clams were tough as a rubber tire to chew through. Like others have said, their shrimp is fresh, but that&#39;s about it. Not saying much since it&#39;s right next to Chinatown so getting fresh shrimp shouldn&#39;t be a problem. Corn tasted old and tough, definitely not fresh juicy corn that came from a fresh produce store. Catfish used a flabby and salty batter that didn&#39;t have any crisp or crunch to it. Every copycat to Boiling Crab knows to use corn meal in the batter, these guys have made a poor attempt at replicating someone else&#39;s success and yet they get rave reviews. I guess if you haven&#39;t tried the best, you don&#39;t have anything to compare it to. It&#39;s equivalent to thinking a chuck steak is awesome because you never had a ribeye.	0
Well, I can appreciate your willingness to try but heres the thing...I explained it both here and on Twitter and you make it sound like you needed to hire a detective to find the link to my yelp and my Twitter. It&#39;s linked. You click on the link and viola??? You are trying to appease me and appeal to the readers. I would not even try going back. Because, instead of handling this like a professional, you aren&#39;t. I have almost twenty years in food and beverage. Do you honestly think that after these kinds of issues and unprofessional harassment on Twitter is going to make me think that you aren&#39;t the type of establishment to spit in the food now? Especially with the punk rock attitude of the cashier that started the whole thing in the first place??? No thanks. I&#39;m good. I prefer my food to taste good. Sure, you say nice things but it&#39;s your intentions that count. And you have none. No worries. I didn&#39;t really like trying to find the place anyways through the industrial plus construction plus far out location. Sucks when people get hungry, they tend to get ornery when they are. Strange, huh?	0
Went here because I love pizza and Yelp told me too. haha.	0
Nothing Organic <br>Food is mediocre <br>No fresh squeezed OJ <br>If you specialize in brunch at least have quality organic eggs<br>and don&#39;t forget the long wait time as well	0
Came to this place for a friends birthday party. The whole theme of the lounge was pretty cool but that was about all that impressed me. The dj seemed like he was playing pandoras top 40 hits, the bathroom had such dim lighting you couldn&#39;t even see yourself in the mirror, the drinks were very overpriced for what you got, and they let in way too many people as the night went on so it became a crowded, sweaty, mess.	0
We had their Sunday Brunch and very thing was outstanding. We can't say enough about this exquisite place right down to the valet parking.	1
The ceviche is not prepared fresh to order and it is cooked longer than desired. I shall continue to frequent Ceviche 105, Gran Inka as well as SuViche for my ceviche cravings	0
This place is amazing! This is my first yelp review ever, and I want to write something because Arco Cafe is new but such a great find!! First of all, the restaurant is simple but beautiful and cozy. There is so much space inside, I forgot I was in New York! They don&#39;t pack you in here. The servers were so kind, and the food...was...absolutely delicious! We simply told the server we wanted typical Sardinian dishes and were very impressed with what we got! (I don&#39;t remember the name of the pasta dish I got, but it was the one with sausages! So good!) And of course we stayed for dessert. If you come, you have to get the semifreddo for dessert! Overall, I think Arco Cafe is really worth the visit!	1
This place is awesome. The beef is slow roasted and the ingredients are quality. I've tried every sandwich and honestly can't pick a favorite. Their home made custard with all the fixings is SO good - save room!	1
Great staff and food. The potato skins deep dish thing is amazing. I don't care much for salads normally but love the honey crisp chicken salad.	0
If you're a SF visitor, you MUST have a bowl of clam chowder. Preferably not from here, but this does give you the wharf-type feel. But honestly, you can do better...like Boudin right across the street. But for a quick eat as you go thing, this is just fine and it's not that expensive.	0
I had a very good latte here. Service was good and very friendly. I like the atmosphere here. It&#39;s big inside with a second floor and large windows.Tables outside. Free street parking on Ogden. A good place to hang out and relax. The desserts looked good. Near Little Ethiopia/ Fairfax area of Pico.	1
I had spicy cold noodles yesterday and I felt so so so so so sleepy after a couple hours. Their warm soup (Yook-soo) tasted strongly MSG.<br><br>The food I guess tastes good of course coz they put so much chemical seasoning!!!<br><br>It&#39;s busy. It&#39;s not worth it. Think about your health!	0
Besides the slow service deep fried everything meatless and tasteless entrees this place isn't too bad. Okay it's not horrible but it not good either. And did I mention very overpriced? At $10 for a Greek salad $13 for a calzone or vege lasagna I expect something solid. This is just okay if that. This is one of a limited number of Kosher hangouts for those who desire that but not high on that list either.	0
Last week, I braved the concrete jungles of K-Town to seek out Belly &amp; Snout for some Pinoy comfort food :P I love grilled cheese and meatball subs and chili fries, so any variant of these are sure to be approved by my discerning stomach. Haha. I ordered the longganisa (longanisa? I&#39;ve seen it spelled both ways) meatball sub, although I was mighty tempted by the chicken adobo grilled cheese. All that savory goodness :) Anyway, my longganisa sub was very tasty, and I may have used every last French fry to finish off the sauce :P I&#39;m all for supporting Filipino cuisine! Kumaan na kayo!	1
The manly burger + truffle cheese fries = amazing!	1
It was PACKED on a Wednesday night. We made a 7:45 reservation with a large party and weren't seated until almost 8:30. What's the point of a reservation? We arrived on time and waited in the lounge with everyone else, but it wasn't until 15 minutes in that we realized they disregarded our reservation and began seating other parties. At 8:15, we went upstairs to see what the hold up was and saw that there were NO tables. Okay?? We were about to walk away, but they managed to shoo away another party after we complained incessantly. As for the food, it was just okay. The salt and pepper crab was bad quality crab and extremely difficult to eat. All the breading is on the shell, and the amount of meat is just pitiful. The signature beef looked like beef jerky, and kind of tasted like it too. Except it was soft, sweet, and had ZERO salt. Not good at all. Peking duck was bleh. Not cut properly, lot of bones... I've had so much better. Crispy tofu had some sort of mystery meat on top, and was half decent. I don't remember what other dishes we ordered, but nothing particularly stood out. I think there are plenty of better places to get Chinese food, don't see what the hype is about R&G!	0
I think Habanero's has another location off Stoughton. This location is the same setup as the other one. First, you decide if you want tacos, a burrito, a burrito bowl, or a salad. Then, you choose your meat. There's barbacoa, carnitas (slow-cooked pulled pork, not the fried pork), adobo steak, adobo chicken, al pastor, or veggie. Then, there are a bunch of things you can add, like pico de gallo, sour cream, 3 different salsas, beans, cheese, etc.	0
I just ordered food from this place and I am impressed. Unassuming but the food was very delicious. They also do delivery which is a plus. You must try this one.	1
I have to say, I must have come on great service day, because my experience was nothing like some of the reviews here. The maitre d' was awesome. I arrived on time for the reservation, but my date was 15 minutes behind. Not a problem, he said, Ill hold a table for you. He ended up seating us outside by the fireplace, making it very romantic. Our waitress was great as well, very friendly. The food was decidedly excellent. We enjoyed everything we ordered. I say give it a try and hopefully you show up great service day also.	1
Who put Santa Monica in our Silver lake?	0
What a disappointment, slow to seat us , no hostess but it was empty.Way too dark . Portions very small. The beef tartar was $9.00 for a tablespoon of beef. The mussels and calamari were served lukewarm and without bread for the juice. The salads were in a small bowl with a wide rim giving the illusion there was more. My caesar had hunks of blue cheese in it , odd the other caesar did not. Again all the salads were $9 for a half cup. The lasagne was tasty but again no bread or anything else. I don't believ this place was advertised as a tapas place but I've had bigger portions for less money at a tapas place. Total bill over hundred bucks. Never go back and I am in a position to recommend restaurants in the area. Stay away!	0
After seeing so many great reviews, my mom and I stopped in for dinner here one night really looking forward to a great meal. It wasn&#39;t so great. <br><br>Both of the dishes we ordered were fairly bland. It wasn&#39;t bad, but it wasn&#39;t great. The price for the portion wasn&#39;t quite on par with the style of restaurant either. Casa Mia down the street is maybe a dollar or two more for some entrees, but provided a much better experience and more flavorful food. <br><br>The experience killed it for us more than anything. Service was so slow, and not because they were busy. One of the only other tables seemed to be either regulars or friends of the owners because everyone working there spent almost the whole time at that table, seated with them and chatting. Every once in a while, our waitress would get up from their table and come see if we needed anything. She wasn&#39;t apologetic for any wait, and she wasn&#39;t particularly friendly. <br><br>Overall, we left with a bad taste in our mouth as a combination of bland food and bad service.	0
Went to this restaurant to be adventurous and it&#39;s very close to where I live. The staff are friendly and helpful and the food was truly awesome.	1
I don&#39;t get the hype for this restaurant at all. The order line needs major efficiency fix. They should learn from In n Out -- order, pay, get out of the way. Pick up when your number&#39;s called. <br><br>In here, you waste half an hour waiting in line, then give your order to a lady who then will take your money, go to the cashier AND make your food. Gross. Employee who handles money should NEVER handle food, don&#39;t they know that? <br><br>The sandwiches are just okay, the French Dip is soggy, just as it&#39;s supposed to be, but its sogginess is unappealing to the least. The potato salad is mediocre at best.	0
The Apple Pan. Fantastic. The burger isn't huge, which is nice. People seem to think that if they give you a gigantic slab of beef, you'll consider it good. Total Crap. Everything about this place screams classic.	1
Pie Bar...really?	1
You shouldn't go!!! Too be priced at a premium and didn't taste as good as I thought.	0
This place has some edible food, but not a lot.<br><br>We came in on a rainy evening after finding that Littleneck was closed. My girlfriend is a pescatarian, so we ordered the shrimp appetizer, and one vegetarian pasta (special order--This place is not vegetarian friendly) and for me, a trotters (pork foot) pasta. Our waitress was the standout of the evening. She was helpful and attentive, and she helped us make sense of the oddly worded menu. Really, it was more like talking point for her than a menu. <br><br>The shrimp still lingers with us as a bad memory. It tasted like what I imagine worms in formaldehyde taste like. Mercifully, our waitress took it away and didn&#39;t charge us for it. She very kindly replaced it with an odd sweet potato dish free of charge. It definitely was edible, and thoughtfully put together, but too abrasive for an appetizer. <br><br>The pici &amp; ragu -- well, if you&#39;ve had one fancy ragu, you&#39;ve had&#39;em all. The &#34;pici&#34; are basically wonton noodles and the bowl its served in hints at wonton also. The vegetarian version wasn&#39;t great either.<br><br>This place considers itself Brooklyn-Fancy enough to charge high prices, but it&#39;s really just overly-experimental mediocre food. <br><br>We really appreciated our waitress though.<br><br>PS -- still feeling very put off by the shrimp (amaebi).	0
love this place. we've consistently had great meals here for years. it's dark and can be loud, but the food hasn't been a disappointment yet.	1
I was here Saturday evening thanks to ELL (Eat Like a Local) on #Yelp. Our Community Manager, Johnny T., had the brilliant idea of creating this. It&#39;s a simple concept. Once a month we try-out a local business in Miami. So far it has been restaurants but I&#39;m hoping this catches on and spreads to other businesses as well. It&#39;s a great way to meet other fellow Yelpers as well as branching-out to different areas of Our Communities one normally wouldn&#39;t venture out to. I encourage every Yelp User to check this new concept out. Had it not been for ELL, I would never have known about this fabulous restaurant.<br><br>I&#39;ve never been to the Mediterranean and the closest I&#39;ve been to Spain is Little Havana but, I think it&#39;s fair to say, this business is pretty darn authentic. The decor is simple, cute and to the point. Its simplicity is what makes it unique. It&#39;s almost like being in someone&#39;s home.<br><br>Here you can enjoy conversations with friends while having some wine and tapas in a laid back and relaxing atmosphere. I sampled several tapas and, at least in my opinion, everything was quite delicious. The flavors were something I had never experienced before. <br><br>It was an unique and unexpected experience. I shall be returning here soon with friends. Or, to impress a date if I ever meet one. Their Wine Tasting Event on Thursdays is something I may do first. Check their website for more 411 on that.<br><br>My stand-out Tapas were:<br><br>* Stewed Giant Lima Beans - Bursting with delicious flavor and the beans are perfectly cooked. I was told this was her mother&#39;s personal recipe. VERY NICE!<br><br>* White Bean Hummus - To date, the best Hummus I&#39;ve had. <br><br>We were taking turns sampling each other&#39;s dishes. Again, everything was delicious. These were just my personal two favorites. Lots of wine to choose from here as well. Most, if not all, are authentic to their region.<br><br>I will be back...<br><br>#KeepItLocal	1
Best doughnuts ever...	1
The burgers were good size, tasted good, not juicy, cooked to order, sides should be included instead of being a la carte. The menu is limited too!	1
$9 for one piece of bread cut in half with some plain avocado smushed on top? There are too many good places in Brooklyn to bother with this completely mediocre and severely over-priced place	0
Super good food, kinda hole in the wall but clean, for LA. Owners are really friendly and nice. Some lady at another table got spicy hott wings and I couldn&#39;t take my eyes off of her plate they looked so good. Most def will be back soon. <br><br>Had the Kung pao chicken, chicken chop suey, chicken chow mein and chicken and string beans. And they have an endless supply of siracha.	1
Being Dutch-Indonesian my mom really wanted to try Indonesian food in Seattle when she visited but there are only 2 restaraunts that I could even find... The wait staff was super nice & attentive but the food was just alright. Area is pretty sketch too.	0
Small place but great food, low prices, and very friendly. Large portions too!!	1
Terrible pho. Terrible pork sandwich. Vietnamese coffee was fine. There are framed posters that remind me of that ridiculously stupid film Amelie - enough already, we get it. You all want to be quirky, attractive French girls.	0
We went here on a Monday night. Good food and fun. Went along to this one with my family, to celebrate the Vegas visit. The place had a great atmosphere. The food was perfect, modest portions and speedy service which always makes for a better evening.All 3 of us had 2 courses and were very impressed, will definitely be going again.	1
Food is good and the deal for the price of the food is great but the sevice was okay.	1
YUMMMMMMY!!!!! Calle Tacos is truck-food but BETTER!!!!! & the location is pretty amazing too. Right in the middle of Hollywood (next to Playhouse- so you can eat before you go dancing & eat right after your done). Don't waste your time going anywhere else.	1
I ordered the oxtail and I was pretty disappointed. I&#39;m not even sure if it was real oxtail there were only 2 pieces I was able to identify as oxtail. The rest was meat with broken bones in. Every bite I took I had to pull out small bones. Very disappointing. The rice tasted under done and it was made a couple of days ago. They didn&#39;t have macaroni and cheese today so I was quite disappointed. My friend had the chicken brown stew which tasted good and the veggies it came with was tasty. <br>I&#39;d give this place a skip. Chef Creoles oxtail comes out tops so far if you&#39;re looking for this exotic meal, give this place a skip.	0
I like to think of it as $11 In-N-Out with hickory sauce.	0
Food was mediocre, but expensive. I did like their mushroom dumplings .... but 4 dumplings for $14???Don't recommend the Ramyun. Drinks were ok.Wine was ok; but a small pour.	0
Yay!! Finally a decent coffee shop within walking distance! I got an iced salted caramel which was AMAZING! Will definitely become a regular! Looks like they have food too - will have to come back for that!	1
One of the best restaurants in this area. Food is fresh, well-prepared, and very tasty. Everything is excellent, bread, starters, mains, dessert, and cappuccino.	0
We had brunch here on our last day in Seattle. Had the doughnuts everyone raved about--even though I'm not crazy about doughnuts, I ate 5 out of 6 of them...and they are WAY better than NOLA beignets!!! Had Tom's big breakfast which was delic! Would recommend!	0
Just at here tonight for the 2nd time and I def don't remember it being this bad?!?! The fish in my fish tacos was old dry and very chewy! Might be some of the tasteless fish I've ever had.	0
Amazing smoked salmon chowder!!	1
New location. Same menu. Same deliciousness. <br><br>This location is more spacious than the one in Santa Monica. They have a table inside and outside of the store. They still make the food in front of you and they make it quick! The staff members are nice and friendly and they&#39;ll help you out if you need help deciding which omusubi to order. They also have daily specials on the blackboard right by the cashier. Complimentary barley tea and water is right behind you after you order. <br><br>They have a customer appreciation card! 10 visits = 1 free omusubi.<br>Only 9 more to goooooo!	1
Beef and cheese sandwich was plain and even a little strange tasting. The only real flavor was the barbecue sauce. Fries were uninspired, tasted old. They forgot to make my milkshake, had to ask them 3 times about it. 20 minutes later I got one, it was good, but the boring food and long wait made it go down bitter. Luckily there was a taco truck across the street, I got a couple tacos so I could actually eat food with flavor. Whoever they were I give their al pastor tacos 5 stars. There's a bug problem in this area and Top Round hasn't figured out how to manage it. The taco truck had bags of water hanging to trap the bugs on the condensation. If Top Round was The Hat (pastrami place), I would be happy. I will be going back, but to get tacos across the street. Thanks for the easy parking Top Round, I hope you fail, you suck.Signed,$14 for crap with no flavor and $2 for delicious tacos across the street.	0
I have heard great things about this place but was absolutely blown away by the food service and ambiance. 	1
The coffee is good here and they are on the CUPS app so it works for me! They are in the basement of the atrium building and have never had a line when I have stopped in for a quick cup before a meeting. The sandwiches look decent but to me seem a bit on the expensive side.	1
I never would have gone here if it hadn't been for my job. The prices are pretty high, the portion size isn't that large, and I'm not the biggest burger fan. However one of the perks of where I work is they pay for my lunch from all the local restaurants. And because of that I was able to experience Umami burger and all of it's amazing flavor. For me the Port and Stilton burger is by far the best. I've had almost all of the burgers, but nothing beats the flavor of the Port and Stilton. The sweet potato fries are also a must have. It is pretty pricey, but the food is definitely worth it. And if you're lucky you'll run into some pretty cool people there. Our table got to meet Jim Parsons from The Big Bang Theory...Not a bad night!	1
I honestly don&#39;t understand how this place is racking up so many good reviews.<br><br>I tried this place during the first 2 weeks of their opening. Food was okay. I asked for no calamari on my pasta and they said they couldn&#39;t do that because they use premix frozen seafood and calamari is already in there. So I picked something else. Food came and it tasted pretty much like frozen microwave pasta that you can get from Ralphs, so I was disappointed. Prices were cheap, so I guess I was paying for the microwave pasta + their rent and overhead costs. <br><br>Then I saw all the yelp reviews, and decided to give it one more try. Ordered the truffle pizza, which is supposed to their signature dish, and also pasta. Both came out horrible. Even frozen pizza tasted better than that, and there were no real truffle on that pizza at all despite it costing $26. The truffle pizza at Spago costs the same (though smaller in size) and it was full of truffles. Anima&#39;s truffle pizza was basically bread + truffle oil + overly huge pieces of tomato cut unevenly by what seems to be a disgruntled employee. Pasta is still as mediocre as before.<br><br>Maybe it&#39;s just my luck, but I&#39;m definitely not coming back. There are other much better italian places in town.	0
I was really looking forward to a good place to eat in Portage Park and Leadbelly seemed promising. My burger was unevenly cooked and nothing special. My friend liked his burger. Fries were completely burned and inedible. The cookies were good. The craft beers are the main attraction.	0
Had the beef brisket plate with collard greens and mac&amp;cheese ......my man had the baby back ribs and same sides as mine.........<br><br>Brisket was good and the ribs were a bit too tough.<br>Collard greens = you need a new recipe....it was NOT GOOD at all!!!<br>Mac &amp; cheese were the best....I do recommend them!<br><br>Great place...great service after all...great vibe as well...	0
Give me a sparkling rose and a bowl of fresh papardelle with sausage, peas and cheese and I&#39;m totally happy. THE BEST pasta I&#39;ve had since leaving the east coast. For some reason the left coast doesn&#39;t usually stack up with Italian fare from the tri-State area. We almost gorged ourselves on bread until we realized the goodness heading our way. One friend and dining partner dreams about their carbonara. Another ordered a dish with smashed red bliss potatoes that the rest of us kept picking at because they were so good. The portions were nice- we had two starters amongst the 3 of us as well as an entree each. What looks like a smaller bowl of pasta is really a perfect portion when you think about how gross you feel after a giant family size dish. We waited for a while, watching our table-neighbors get served, but the hostess sincerely apologized and comped some food. We honestly were enjoying the company so the wait wasn&#39;t too bad, but it&#39;s nice to see service is a priority there as well with fresh ingredients. Can&#39;t wait to go back to LA!	1
Love the Pink Door!	1
Too packed<br><br>Bartender is not attentive at all. We ordered our beers then wanted to leave to check out another bar down the street. <br><br>Bf literally stood at the bar trying to pay for ten minutes!! Bartender just ignored him, kept making drinks, helped another customer who came after he did. All he had to do was let us know he&#39;s busy and that he&#39;d get to us as soon as possible. But NO, he continued to ignore to make drinks. Bf had to WAVE to get the bartender&#39;s attention!<br><br>Horrible! Won&#39;t be going back!	0
As we arrived earlier then expected, the restaurant crew was very flexible with the change of time and offered us an earlier table! Unfortunately, the noise coming from the kitchen food outtake was very intensive and disturbed the athmosphere.	1
If it was possible to give this place no stars, I would do so. The poor rating is not for the food, as my party and I were refused from indulging, but for the staff and service. A member of my party of 4 called at 3 pm for a reservation as is Mu&#39;s policy. We were given an 8:00 p.m. spot and all members arrived on time. For 40 minutes, we were apologetically told that a table would be ready shortly and it would be ours. At the end of that 40 minutes, the hostess said our spot was ready and walked all four members over to the counter to seat us there. Now, Mu plainly notes on their website that their seating is &#34;communal&#34; and we were all aware of that going in to the experience. However, this was a &#34;going away&#34; dinner, and we weren&#39;t thrilled by the idea of waiting 40 minutes on top of our reservation and then being spread out at the counter because it&#39;s not conducive to socializing or sharing food. One member of the party made a comment to another member about her dissatisfaction with the situation as we were sitting down, and apparently the man in the kitchen (on the other side of the counter) overheard and rather rudely told us that this was their policy and that if we didn&#39;t like it we could leave. Nobody made a scene, and we were still planning to eat. It was simply one party member making a quiet comment about her disappointment in our seating arrangement. After he made his suggestion, he decided that he didn&#39;t want us in his restaurant (he was apparently the owner), refused service and told us to leave. Quite confused about this rather abrupt request, we spoke with the hostess (the owner&#39;s wife) to see if he would reconsider, given that we had already waited 40 minutes. He continued to refuse and became more and more aggravated, and so we left. Again, no scene caused.<br><br>I&#39;ve never seen such a blatant disregard for customer service. It was quite apparent that the owner felt no remorse in kicking us out, as he had a packed restaurant and people waiting to take our spots. I understand that it is his establishment and we need to respect his rules. However, never were we told that we would not be seated at a table and nor is a bar what most people would consider &#34;communal&#34;. There were other 4-person parties ahead of us that were seated at tables and there were plenty of 2 person parties that could&#39;ve been seated in the space at the bar set aside for us without compromising their experience. Had the hostess communicated better and told us what was available and given us the option to wait for the table, we would have, but that was never an option. I understand that Mu has seen a great deal of positive press lately regarding its food, and I&#39;m sure it is great, but if they don&#39;t get a better grasp on customer service and running restaurant, their success will be short-lived. Reservation or not, I would not recommend anyone go to this place, especially with a party of 4.	0
Perhaps it's the love for unconventional food, but I think Umami Burger lives up to its hype. Sure the portions are smaller and I'm a girl who can easily down a 1/2lb burger with the works and a basket of steak fries. For those kind of days, that's what Fatburger or heck, the $2 happy hour burgers at McCormick and Schmick's, are for. But a restaurant that wants to put an innovative, creative twist to the classic burger? Input Umami Burger here. Crafting ingredients together, each burger has it's own mixture of flavors. Several trips deep, I shall breakdown the various delishnessness I have consumed:Umami burger - their original burger, my favorite part of this was the crispy cheese that sat in between the ingredients.Hatch burger - pieces of 4 different types of chilies gave my taste buds a kick and with the house cheese, the combo had a latin buzz to it.Port & Stilton burger - with the warmth of the burger, the blue cheese melted slightly to mingle with the sweet and salty port caramelized onions. Definitely flavorful but an option that's not to risky.Spanish burger - the lamb was a bit gamey but with the saffron aioli, rioja sauce, and roasted red bell pepper hash, the gamey-ness was masked with a bit of spiciness. Triple-fried hand cut fries, thick tempura onion rings, sugar-sprinkled sweet potato fries, thin thin fries - any side accompanies well with the burgers. Definitely will go back to try the manly burger and truffle burger.	1
This place was an excellent choice for breakfast. I found them on Yelp while searching to find something good, healthy, and close by. I had the 'Kitchen Sink' which was good but my sister had the 'Lumberjack breakfast platter' and it was soooo good and plenty of food! The staff was friendly. Looks like the locals frequent this cafe (which is always a good sign because tourist restaurant usually aren't that great in my opinion.) 24 hours is so convenient and they deliver!	1
Great service, no unhappy cranky employees so - All good. Fantastic food. Proportions that don't encourage my belly but plenty of great beer that does. Great vibe. Overall this place lives up to it's hype.	1
The atmosphere was really nice but the food was very expensive and nothing special. I have had better food in little neighborhood places for a 1/4 of the cost.I am a real foodied and didn't find the menu or the food to be very flavorful or unique in any way. as a matter of fact the food was quite bland.	1
My experience at Bianca&#39;s was overall negative. There was a lack of heating at the restaurant. We voiced our concern to the staff and they were indifferent to the situation. However, the price of the food was reasonable and it was of decent quality.	0
Not just the best grilled cheese I&#39;ve ever had but one of the best sandwiches I&#39;ve ever eaten. I now love food trucks and this one rocks. The Goat Cheese &amp; Prosciutto is off the chawangazagn. As well as the Bleu Cheese sandwich. I love salty. Would be cool if prices were a bit lower but that might not be possible. <br><br>Rock On Ms. Cheezious!	1
This place packs a punch with service. I had several waitreses check on us several times with very friendly smiles. The food came out fast but tasted good and fresh. I just came for &#34;breakfast&#34; which was steak, french fries and eggs over-easy. My husband was excited about the lil tiny bits of crispy tostones, (fried plantains), that made their way into the plate by mistake. It was yummy, inexpensive and very, very friendly.	1
Disappointing. After a delicious, illicit cocktail in the middle of the day and that groovy ceiling sculpture, I was amped to love the food. The flavors were good but the portions are small (really) and ordering anything breaded is a mistake; the breading encased the flounder like impenetrable armor. Speaking of "Po' Boy," we spent $100 on lunch for 2 and for that, we should have left beyond satisfied. As it is, I doubt there will be a next time.	0
We had an excellent experience last night! Went to Grampa's (for the first time!) for the date night special - an appetizer, pizza, dessert, and bottle of wine for $40 per couple. AMAZING. We had great service - very attentive and nice waitress. We split a salad for the app and it was fresh and delicious with shaved vegetables and a nice vinaigrette. The pizza was phenomenal and just the right amount of food. The wine went down smooth and complimented the food wonderfully. The dessert was great, and we received complimentary ginger macaroons when we finished!	0
My boyfriend and I stumbled upon this place after much desperation. We always get off around Lorimer and realize there are really no great places to eat. After yelping we found this. It was 5:30, so super early. Everyone was super nice. It was like we had 6 waiters. But the place is small, the tables a bit crunched. But the wine and beer were great, the guy even brought me a different wine because I didn&#39;t like the first wine I tasted. I got the almond crusted tilapia slider and my boyfriend got the rib eye slider. They were both fantastic. But my boyfriend polenta fries were insane!! Price is medium, and they even gave us a flyer for their thanksgiving 5 course meal. We may just check it out.	1
Great burgers, awesome beer selection.<br>Very friendly owners<br>Get there early, space is limited, and when they run out of buns, they close!<br>Just made best new burger 2013 in Time Out Chicago too, well deserved	1
ordered Thai iced tea with tapioca, calamari, shrimp tuxedo, spicy chicken with flat noodles, and Pad Thai. Enjoyed the food but as soon as i came home.... i had an explosive diarrhea... two consecutive times...never wanna go there again... and i am a big fan of Thai food.... the price was pricier than other Thai restaurants... the prices were like how it is in Manhattan.	0
So I arrive at about 5:30 on a Tuesday. Most of the tables are empty. A woman sits alone at one of them. <br><br>The hostess asks how many. I tell her two.<br><br>&#34;Come back when you have two,&#34; she snaps.<br><br>Okay. I mean, I don&#39;t like that &#34;Wait until your whole party is here to be seated rule,&#34; but what are you going to do? They&#39;re not the only restaurant with this policy.<br><br>I turn and am about to text my friend, when a party of three comes in. <br><br>&#34;Yeah, if you could just wait OUTSIDE,&#34; the hostess says, looking at me as if I&#39;m the worst person in the world for not thinking immediately of standing outside in the DECEMBER cold. It&#39;s freezing outside. I know that my friend, who&#39;s very reliable, is not going to stand me up.<br><br>Again, the restaurant is mostly empty. Yes, it&#39;s small, but she could have easily gotten me out of the way by giving me a table.<br><br>I know it&#39;s not a &#34;we must not waste a table on single diners&#34; policy because of the other woman sitting there alone. Maybe I should have said I was dining alone and pretended my friend came by surprise?<br><br>I&#39;m sorry, do I look homeless or something? Seriously, I was treated like I was dripping bedbugs and eating off other diners&#39; plates. WTF. <br><br>Incidentally, I was dressed in nice business casual and wearing heels. The other diners looked pretty scruffy.<br><br>Needless to say we went elsewhere. After this experience, the nearby Cowgirl Hall of Fame restaurant seemed super classy in comparison.	0
Interesting appetizers, well crafted signature coktails, solid draft beers and excellent food.Read the menu - it's just the right length to please most and the preparation is top nothc.Well done B&amp;O!	0
Everything was very good except my hanger steak was overdone and very tough to chew. The burger was fantastic though. At one point we had to move to a different table because we were seated at a community table and a large party came in, which was a little annoying. We should of been sat at a two person table to begin with.  Overall it was very good minus a couple things.	1
We were staying nearby @ Hotel Murano and found this place thru our fave reference US. Decided to stop by during their happy hour and we enjoyed beer wine and select appies on-da-cheap.	1
Came here for a bite to eat. Ordered cafe com latte and sandwich de bistec. Sandwich and coffee was phenomenal. Will be looking forward to come here again.	1
It is my mission in life to eat all of Seattle's salmon benedict before I leave this fair city. Tilikum is probably where I should've started. Delicate, rich, contradictory flavors all over the place; well done to yon chefs. Keep in mind that this place is pretty tiny so I'd highly recommend reservations unless you don't mind a wait (or want to grab a booze at 5 Point next door). Service is efficient and friendly and they love telling you about where all the food comes from. Great spot for breakfast/brunch and I hope to return soon!	0
I am SHOCKED that this place has such good reviews, and they really fooled me into suggesting this place for a few friends when we had a night out...it&#39;s been a few months, but this place just stands out like a sore thumb, and it is quite possibly the worst meal experience I had while I lived in NYC for over a year. <br><br>Like Jing. H. (I don&#39;t personally know this reviewer) mentioned below, my waitress also came over at the end of our meal ASKING FOR MORE TIP...And not only that, the encounter ended with her SCREAMING and shouting, and calling us &#34;DISGUSTING&#34; while everyone else in the restaurant turned to look at us. And she tried to say how some tourists didn&#39;t know how to tip properly...what an excuse. <br><br>Really, even before this encounter at the end of the meal, the SERVICE WAS HORRIBLE -- EXTREMELY RUSHED, EVEN WITH NO ONE WAITING. We waited for over 30 minutes for a table, and the moment we sat down, the waitress asks for our orders...Please give some space to breathe and at least read over the menu. <br><br>And to top it all off, none of us particularly liked our array of dishes and appetizers...what&#39;s the fuss on Yelp about this place? (Keep in mind that this was before any nasty waitress encounter.) I was starting to feel very guilty for bringing friends along to here. And the food is SO OVERPRICED for SMALL PORTIONS. Crazy how you can get top quality, authentic Vietnamese food all across California for half the price. You&#39;re really paying for the trendy, hipster setting here...why bother?	0
Places like Manger Creole are the reason why locals should take advantage of sites like Yelp. But for this website/app, I would have had no idea MC existed and that would have been a shame. I don&#39;t (didn&#39;t) find myself in this part of Miami on a regular basis so I would have had no occasion to try it out. But, on a relatively busy Thursday, I found myself in Civic Center working on a partnership. After the meeting, I realized that I was hungry. Not wanting to drive back to South Beach and eat at home, I was hoping to get something from the neighborhood. I spied nothing with my naked eye so I Thundercatted my way in to sight beyond sight, used my app... and there it was: Haitian goodness all for me.<br><br>After getting past all the tips about how &#39;foine&#39; the guy behind the counter was/is, I got to the meat of the matter: food, quantity, quality, and price. Everything ticked my buttons, so I entered, saw the guy who was being stalked by nurses and admin workers throughout the neighborhood, made my order, watched it being prepared fresh for me (I wasn&#39;t getting reheated food), packed it up, and went home to feast.<br><br>Oh. My. I&#39;m a fan of Haitian food to begin with but this... this here. Oh. My. I ordered the stewed goat and it was enough food for two big meals. I eat a lot. I have a big appetite. I was felled by the portions. &#39;Generous&#39; is an understatement. The meat was perfectly-seasoned and appropriately spiced (enough to stimulate your senses but not so much that your tongue catches fire and your nose runs; you can still taste the food), the onions &amp; peppers gave depth and crunch and the cabbage &amp; carrots made me want to add them to all my meals. But this was just the main dish. The meal ALSO came with rice &amp; plantains. All this food for $12. If you live/work in the (surrounding) neighborhood, come here now. If you don&#39;t, make a point to get lunch/dinner to go. MC is the kind of establishment that will do just fine on the business from locals but it deserves the attention of everyone. It&#39;s that good.	1
If you want a delicious steak cooked to your likeling this is the place.  Best tasting porterhouse in Baltimore.  Also the sommelier is very good and doesn't &quot;up sell&quot; you.	0
Not only is the ambience amazing, but the food and drinks were just as great. I can&#39;t wait to return and explore the menu some more... I defiantly recommend trying this place	1
DineLA fail! I usually avoid giving negative reviews, but this restaurant was just disappointing.<br><br>-Came here for the hanger steak, as advertised in the dineLA menu online, only to find this replaced with less exciting entrees such as chicken breast and salad.<br>-Ordered the grilled market corn from the regular menu instead, and requested to cut this into thirds for our party of three, but learned they couldn&#39;t because they had already precut their corn into halves. So our waitress said we could either order three halves at an additional cost, or the three of us can just share two halves. Lol! Like we can take turns eating off the same corn? And they can&#39;t just take a new corn and cut it into thirds?<br>-Forgot our pink eggs with ham.<br>-Forgot my friend&#39;s beer too.<br>-Lastly, if anyone reading this still plans on going, my advice is to order meat well done, because my friend&#39;s &#34;medium&#34; lamb burger looked raw! :-O	0
The service was outstanding but the food was quite pricey and fell short of expectations. Very little crab meat in the $18 kao phad pu fairly bland $13 phad mi.	0
So Perch. Was interesting. The decor is beautiful and the roof top views are breathtaking. That alone would be worth a visit.<br><br>I have to take points away for the food and the crowd, though. This place attracts the type of LA-ian that fulfills the stereotypes of everyone who doesn&#39;t live in LA. There was quite a bit of pretentiousness in the air and a lot of indoor shades wearing. Some people were just downright rude. Or maybe I&#39;m *too* Southern. I haven&#39;t figured that part out yet.<br><br>The food was - eh. Ok. I ordered the Heuvos Rancheros and one of my companions ordered the crab benedict. Neither one of us were impressed, but the third member of our party raved about the french toast. So there&#39;s that.<br><br>Our waitress was super cool. Very, very friendly, laidback, easygoing, all the good things you want from your server. The bartender on the rooftop bar was super cool as well (and very funny). <br><br>I think this place is worth a visit or two, but I wouldn&#39;t go back if I am ever in LA again.	0
I don't know if it was the cake or the ice cream it was served with but something had a hint of coriander and it was to DIE for... OMG... 	1
Take a time-travel trip to the 1950s just by walking into The Pantry on Figueroa & 9th in downtown LA. I felt like I was in a black-and-white noir movie, and the characters sitting at the counter were integral to the cast. In fact the whole decor (if you can call it that) is black & white. A woman sitting in a booth near the door takes your money - no credit cards, please; hey, it's the '50s. The menu - including wonderful old standards like spaghetti & meat balls, meat loaf, and French toast - is on the wall. I told a friend, a native Angeleno, that I was going to be in downtown LA for a convention and he said I had to stop in at The Pantry. He was right. I hope that all the cool people now living downtown aren't too cool to eat here!	1
Ordered a chicken noodle soup last week b/c I had a cold and my wonderful husband brought it to me @ work (it was on the way to my job... I should have made him detour to La Carreta or Sergio&#39;s.) I was so upset when I opened the paper bag... the soup was like nothing I had ever seen before. Chicken fat (yes! fat! the part most people trim and discard), parts of tendon-y veiny chicken, not one piece of white breasty edible meat, about 10 noodles total, potato chunks the size of olives (and about 5 or 6 of them) and absolutely no flavor at all. Completely unacceptable and disgusting. I will never ever order from this place or recommend them to anyone.	0
this place rocks. i came here a couple of days ago for lunch. i had the beef rendang. very friggin good. generous portion too. my friend F got a couple of hand rolls which looked awesome and she loved. <br><br>again, this place would be 5 stars if they took credit cards and if they were open for dinner. but i love it!!!	1
It pains me to leave a bad review, I wanted this place to be great, but my experiences were not.<br><br>Service wasn&#39;t bad, but the food was. The best way I can describe it is overpriced mismatched foods on a plate. Everything had a strange assortment of American ingredients that just didn&#39;t blend well. Nobody really enjoyed their meal, and we left somewhat disappointed. <br><br>I hope they improve, because the location has everything working for them...	0
the food was elegant and the atmosphere was nice and quiet. I would recommend you ask for a table by the fireplace for a more relaxed area instead of by the door and casino	1
I&#39;ve eaten at a few different locations and they are all great. The food is healthy, fresh and quite good for something coming out of a steam table. It&#39;s very quick service and great for an on the go lunch. Great concept.	1
I think it&#39;s pretty difficult to find REALLY GOOD coffee in the EV. Besides honeyhaus on 11th and 1st I think Cafe Silan is a winner. I usually get the chai tea and my tastebuds have never tasted something so delicious.<br><br>Their food is pretty phenomenal as well. I had a frittata and their sandwiches are pretty tasty!	1
if you're not a fan of homeless people panhandling while grubbing...this is not the spot for you. but, if you like killer salads and paninis...this could definitely be your spot.My favorites...the farmer's market salad and the caprese panini.service is helpful, but not smothery.prices are super affordable. did i mention they deliver?did i mention they've got killer fries?	1
Spicy Miso Ramen fo your soul!!I've tried other menus but spicy miso ramen is far my favorite.Their fried chicken is also pretty good!I don't really recommend chicken bowl because it was just rice with dry chicken breast...unless you like it	1
Fat Sals Deli boasts extra wide hero bread, but it is no bigger than a Subway. And there is nothing &#34;fat&#34; about their sandwhiches. You would think they&#39;d be so stuffed with goodness that you wouldn&#39;t be able to get your mouth around it....no. Very skimpy on the ingredients for a $10 sandwhich. Fries are the super skinny kind smothered in lettuce and hot sauce, making it appear a bigger serving than it is. If you want a unique kind of sandwhich, this is the place, but don&#39;t expect a lot for your money. Totally dissappointed.	0
Overhyped &amp; overpriced!<br><br>FOOD<br>The pizza is NY Style thin crust. It was OKAY, not spectular enough to be worth $5 a slice! I&#39;ve had wayyy better pizza for half the price. IMO costco pizza even tastes better.<br><br>White pizza - Just okay. Really heavy-handed on the ricotta. There was just thick globs of it scattered everywhere.<br><br>Cheese pizza - Average. Kinda greasy<br><br>Mushroom - Average<br><br>Sausage &amp; pepperoni - Probably the better one of them all. It actually had some flavor to it. <br><br>SERVICE<br>SUCKED! Pretty much you walk up to the counter and the person takes your order. The lady who helped us was rude. Honestly seemed like she HATED her job. Just gave us her frowning face &amp; asked us what we wanted. The pizzas were just laid on the counter in front of her and it didn&#39;t even really look all appealing. But since we made it all the way here, we might as well order. She only warmed up two out of our 4 slices. So our food was half warm, half cold. <br><br>AMBIANCE<br>This place is on the 3rd floor of cosmopolitan near the Blue Ribbon Sushi place. But there are no signs mentioning the pizza place. At first, we couldn&#39;t find it and had to ask someone where it was. The lady just said to walk down the long halfway &amp; it&#39;ll be there. The place is pretty much just a counter with some side counters and chairs to eat but that&#39;s pretty much it. Nothing memorable.<br><br>Definitely won&#39;t be back. Come on Cosmopolitan, I would have expected better dining places!	0
This is a great place to build your own burger and if it is done just write it may be one of the best burgers u ever had it even tops umami if u dont overkill on ingredients. The milkshakes they have also are great and the sweet potato fries are delicious make sure to ask for extra radish mayo sauce	1
Big place with what appears to be a busy bar scene.  The food was average, but relative to the cost of non-fast food resturants in the area, a decent deal.  Located not too far off the strip and easy to get too with decent parking.	1
You just can&#39;t beat the setting of this place. The patio is beautiful. We decided to check out the newly renovated bar. I thought it was beautiful as well. Rustic wood beams and walls share the space with elegant chandeliers and mirrors. Everyone else was expecting something different so I got the feeling they were a little disappointed. That&#39;s what happens when you have expectations. They drinks are ok, a little pricey at $11 a pop. I was not impressed with my appetizers. Ordered Gorgonzola fries (meh) and Caponata (meh). I&#39;m used to Caponata being a spread (which I prefer) but it was chunky and hard to eat with the bread. <br>All of this would not stop me from returning to the CLiff&#39;s Edge however. It is a space like no other, at least in East LA.	1
Verde is defiantly one of the more unique eateries in town...not many other sit down restaurants with good food at &#34;world class&#34; museums in this city. First off don&#39;t come hungry and expect to be fed quickly, seating is limited and in my 2 experiences here there was a 30-40 minute wait for a table that was more like an hour...make reservations,bring a snack, or stroll through the museum if you plan on dining. The food has been on point, good ceviche, decent French fries, and the chicken under a brick entree was excellent. Beware the servers will try to up sell (hustle) you into big bottles of water, cocktails, appetizers, desserts, and coffee...you could really get away with sharing an entree but after the wait your belly will do the deciding...one thing for sure, you can&#39;t beat the one of a kind view straight down government cut past the port of Miami with all the cruise ships. It&#39;s only open till 6pm most days, except Thursday till 9pm, but of a bummer since the view at night is great for sipping cocktails.	1
Veal dish sent back. Tough as An old boot. Bread was decent. Service ok. Doesn't look like they finished the restaurant if so not well done. Would not recommend.	0
We were just there for Xmas Eve dinner. Everything was great. The prices are sort of mid-rangey to low and the food is high quality. Even the ketchup was made in-house. They just recently opened, so there will be a larger menu in a few months, and kinks are being worked out. The lights are kept low, tasteful decor. Basically it's a French bistro...but American. Welcome to the neighborhood!Reading the other reviews, I hope they never have a happy hour. I will gladly pay regular price to avoid a happy hour crowd. You probably don't need it.	1
Great pizza and salad! And love the espresso & ice cream dessert. Casual atmosphere with fun food.	1
I've been to Donna's for lunch many times and have always enjoyed the experience. Went to dinner with my family and found that the value just wasn't there . The lamb meatball with polenta dish was mediocre, as was the meatloaf and spaghetti bolognese.  My husband's dinner-sized caesar was just OK.  Most of the selection was priced over $20, yet didn't seem worth it. Glasses of wine were at $9 minimum and martinis set at $03.50 ... not cheap. I thought this was a cafe?!. I'll probably be back for lunch, but will definitely skip supper.	0
This has to be the worst sports bar I&#39;ve ever been to. I ordered a burger with only bacon and cheese and the burger came with everything on it with 2 strips of bacon on a plate. We couldn&#39;t order a cup of water because he said the ice machine doesn&#39;t work so we had to buy bottled water. When I told him the burger order was wrong he told me to just scrap off the stuff I didn&#39;t want...... Wow. The burger was undercooked and cold we paid and left. Worst experience ever. The TVs are crappy and you can barely see the game on them. He was also kicking people out who didn&#39;t order food with there drinks. I do boy recommend this place to anybody. Nothing could have been worse than this experience.	0
Authentic quaint Mexican restaurant. Decent sized portions, great taste	0
This location has finally added more of their food items to the menu which is now displayed on multiple large LCD screens. The Bi-Bim-Bap Rice Balls are yummy yummy - the size of a baseball with veggies & mayo dressing on top and shredded flavored chicken stuffed in the center. The Sal Sal Chicken Strips are fried battered with rice crumbs and comes with a dipping sauce of either apple, garlic, mango, or ranch (mango is the best). There are also now salads, a Sal Sal rice bowl, wraps, and grilled chicken. The wings are still bomb!	1
It was hard determining how many stars to give this place, because I had such an odd experience here. My girlfriends and I came here for dinner on a Saturday night. The atmosphere is modern and stylish: I liked the decor, but not the fact that the place was ridiculously loud almost the entire night. The bathrooms were super clean, which is always a big plus. Service was above average and the food was fairly priced, considering the fact that we were eating in West Town and received a decent amount of food for our money.<br><br>Now on to the actual dining and drinking experience. First, the drinks. Unite Urban Grill offers a variety of innovative specialty cocktails. I am a pretty adventurous drinker, and I happily downed a few Logan Squares, and sampled my friend&#39;s West Town and Pilsen. At one point during the evening, I attempted to order a French martini, and they couldn&#39;t make it for me because they were out of pineapple juice, which seems like a very odd thing for a bar to run out of, but oh well. Overall, the cocktails were very good.<br><br>On to the food itself. The appetizers were hands-down the best part of the meal. Our group shared the Spinach Flatbread and the Lamb Meatballs, which were both divine. For entrees, one friend ordered the Lake Superior Whitefish, which she was very happy with. My other two friends each ordered the Vegetable Gratin, which I sampled and thought was good, but nothing more than that. The flavor was a bit bland and the eggplant was a little on the tough side. <br><br>I ordered the French Dip Sandwich, which was by far the worst entree at our table. The roast beef was this very odd shade of pale elephant gray and just did not taste too great. My sandwich came with a ton of fries, which were excessively coated in salt, to the point that I could only eat a few of them. It was not good. To compensate, I sampled some of the vegetable appetizers we ordered for the table, including the asparagus and the brussel sprouts, both which were very good. For dessert, we all shared a piece of the lemon cake, which again I thought was just okay. Nothing special.<br><br>So why does this average dining experience deserve only a two-star rating? Well, after I went home, I was up all night, sick as a dog. It was not pleasant. Could it have been due to something I ate that night? Maybe, but I had no way of knowing for sure...until I talked with one of my friends the next day, who told me that she also was sick to her stomach the same night after our dinner. Two very upset stomachs at the same time on the same night, right after sharing a lot of the same food does not sit well with me, my friends. For that reason, along with the mediocre dining experience in general, I will not be returning to Unite Urban Grill.	0
pretty decent food.only tried the burgers and fries so far.only one problem is that it was impossible to get the paper off from burgers!they have to do something about the wrapping paper.besides that, all goooood.	1
Meh. The one vegetarian option was not good. The calamari was also not very good.	0
After hitting up the Windmill Library I was craving some Mexican food, so I decided to check this spot out since its right by the library. <br><br>Was kind of hesitant at first, since its a grill inside a gas station/car wash, no one was there and there was only one guy who cooks and takes the orders. ...But based on the prices, reviews and my craving- I rolled with it. <br><br>Got myself a California burrito bc well... I&#39;m from Los Angeles and never had a Cali burrito.... hahah So, I was curious on LV&#39;s take on Cali burritos. <br><br>The attendant/cook was cool and friendly. He really hooked it up. That was a huge burrito, just like back home. He then asked me, hot sauce or mild sauce. I&#39;m a dragon when it comes to spice- hot sauce don&#39;t really phase me -so I passed on the mild.<br><br>Took my first bite w/o sauce and damn! It&#39;s pretty good- some decent quality. It doesn&#39;t taste like an LA burrito but its still damn good. First time I had a burrito with fries in it! I then poured a load of hot sauce and damn... That hot sauce has a kick! I like it! <br><br>The super nachos is MASSIVE and delicious... Definitely enough for 4 peeps. I had the carne asada super nachos and man... So much carne asada!!! Just look at the picture! <br><br>Overall, going to be hitting this spot when I need a Mexican food fixin&#39;.<br><br>PS. 4 hours later and I don&#39;t have the BGs. Unlike some of the Mexican joints back home. So I&#39;m definitely coming back!	1
Went a second time two days later! The food is great. A little pricey but worth it. The ambience is perfect. They have single dishes and platters that you can share. Sits right on the Linq so that you can people watch. The staff gives great customer service. The desserts are worth saving room for.	1
Food is OK, but service is HORRIBLE. I have been to this place about 10 times, 9 of which the service has been extremely poor and slow. On my last visit, I decided to definitely never go back. Was served a hot soda, and when I finally managed to grab the server&#39;s attention and address the issue, she started an argument with excuses and a bad attitude and a general lack of respect towards the myself, the customer - instead of simply offering a replacement. This been the general service all throughout my visits to this place, needless to say, I am NEVER GOING BACK!	0
2.5 stars <br><br>Came here for the pho, its okay not the greatest. Soup wasn&#39;t as &#34;msg-y&#34; as i wanted it to be. why was my soy beans sprouts and lemon dunked in there already... and the noodles were just okay. the meat wasn&#39;t good at all.....however, the price was amazing though, $5 for a HUGE bowl- probably big enough to feed two people. but obviously i finished it all....<br><br>Don&#39;t expect amazing service its more like you have to go in there knowing what you want to eat. Right when you sit down they take out their pen and paper and wait for you to order...i didn&#39;t even take my jacket off yet..<br><br>I want to come back for the duck and see how that goes. but as for the pho. look as where	0
Laid back ambiance and amazing drinks. Came here for a date night with the hubby on a Friday night before heading to Motorino, we sat at the bar. Place wasnt too packed, which was cool with me. We ordered some drinks, the pickle platter, and the wings bc who can resist happy hour wings?? Everything was on point, the drinks were some of the best Ive had in a long time; I forgot the names but it had honey gin and lemon in it. The bartenders were friendly and attentive, couldnt ask for anything more! We will def be coming back.	1
YES YES YES<br><br>My dreams became true and Ms Cheezious is now a restaurant!<br><br>Love the decor, love the outside garden, and LOVE the grilled cheeses<br><br>There is something wrong with you if you don&#39;t love Ms. Cheezious.	1
GOT TO TRY THE MARISCAS SOUP! It&#39;s a huge bowl of YUM for a more than reasonable price!! Also, everything is great on the menu!	1
Food was excellent. Went for Sunday brunch. Interesting ingredients. Small yet varied menu. Service was excellent and friendly. Atmosphere relaxed. Decor funky. Would definitely go back when we return on our next visit to NYC	1
Upon arrival, the bartenders basically ignored us for 5+ minutes while we waited for our table. It was a fairly busy evening, but to not even make eye contact or let us know it would be a few minutes was disappointing.  From that point on, the wait staff as well as the restaurant manager did everything they could to make up for the poor initial service. Kudos to them for saving the night and providing a great meal and experience.	1
The problem with this restaurant is the problem with Chicago dining in General... There is not a single healthy option or way to modify food to become healthier at all. Even the salads are sitting in bowls of cream sauce. I understand that it&#39;s a diner and that it&#39;s not supposed to be a salad bar, or vegetarian restaurant, but you&#39;d think someone as creative a she would have some reasonably healthy options on the menu. <br><br>The goat chili is superb though. <br><br>In all, meh..	0
I was hesitant to try the Corner out after doughboys didn't make it, but the hostess and server were extremely nice. I totally love the harvest turkey burger and the sweet potato fries are amazing! I am happy that they still have the same baker, so they still have the famous red velvet cake still!I have taken my friends there and everything I have tried so far has been good. They are able to serve wine and beer now so that will probably help out. I have only had dinner there so can't say anything about the breakfast. The portions are smaller than at doughboys but the food is still just as good, if not better.	1
Came in around 4pm one hot afternoon looking for a refreshing drink. My boyfriend and I were saddened and confused when the bartender refused to make us mojitos because they weren&#39;t &#34;on the menu&#34; at that time of day. <br><br>It was like... bro, you&#39;ve a bartender.... with a full bar, and you&#39;re a Cuban joint.... um, wait, why can&#39;t you make one? I see the copious amount of rum right behind you and pre-washed mint eleven inches from your fingers.	0
Do not come here on a weekend! <br><br>At least not until they hire more waitstaff.<br><br>I came here on a Sunday for brunch and the place was pretty packed. I tried to find someone, anyone who I could ask about a table. No sooner than I step through the threshold do I get nearly run over by a waiter sprinting through the restaurant. No apologies. He just kept right on going. The people are packed like sardines in this tiny dining room. Finally, I head butted my way to a woman standing behind a counter and managed to get us an empty table outside. From that point on, we waited about 15 mins for water, 30 minutes to order, and another 30 after we were done with our meal for the check to come. What really infuriated me was that a French couple at the next table sat down after us and were served much more quickly. Basically, no attention was paid to us the entire time.<br><br>This is by far one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had. The owners here try to pack as many tables into the restaurant as possible, hire as few people as possible in order to lower costs and maximize profit at the expense of the customer&#39;s experience. It&#39;s such a shame because the food was not bad. However, I will never come here again.<br><br>Get your act together!	0
Big fan of this place.Love the ambiance for both the indoor and outdoor seating options. Only drawback from sitting inside is small tables. Which do not serve well for party of 3.Great food , awesome Sunday scene and waiting staff has always been pleasant as well.A 4.5 star in my book.	1
The dim sum was cold and the prices were higher than other Dim Sum places in Miami. We ordered sesame balls and asked if they could be cut in half. This is not a ridiculous request because it is done at other dim sum establishments. The woman pushing the cart looked at me and in Chinese said &#34;Take care of it yourself&#34; and walked away. I would have settled for a &#34;Sorry, I don&#39;t have scissors to cut them.&#34; Couldn&#39;t believe how rude she was. I would rather take my business to Canton Palace on SW 8th St. Food and service is much better!	0
I love this place. Very old school! Their burgers are alright (I've had better) but I absolutely love their french fries. And if you love pie - this is the place to go to. Their apple pie and banana cream pie are fantastic. (You'll have to drop by before 8 pm if you want the banana cream pie). Note: The wait can be verryyyyyyyy long if you wanna sit down.	1
Man! I&#39;m a sucker for grilled cheese... Paired w a glass of wine and a friendly staff. It&#39;s over. I had the 3 cheese and the mini tomato soup for dipping. Unreal. I shall be back.	1
I will start off by complementing the CHEF because dinner was delicious last night.The SERVERS were great,very attentive and very nice.The SERVERS made my family and me feel comfortable under the circumstances.<br><br>But the HOST was not too welcoming and our WAITER was not good,his customer service was terrible.I honestly felt like he was stereotyping us.He never asked how our meal was,every time I said &#34;thank you&#34; he never replied with a &#34;you&#39;re welcome&#34;.He never smiled,limited eye contact,he was not kid friendly,he did not offer dessert,he seemed bothered.<br><br>We made reservations earlier that day and informed them that we had a Groupon beforehand.When we received our bill,the WAITER seemed annoyed because we had a Groupon voucher.He even put a sticker attached to our bill on how much we should tip.For one,tips are not mandatory,I tip based on the quality of service.His sticker asked for a $14 tip,I left a $20 tip for the SERVERS not the WAITER.<br>PS<br>Our wait for our dinner was long,even heard other customers complaining in frustration.	0
After a three hour wait for concerts tickets at the hollywood bowl, we decided to check out little dom's since their breakfast pizza was featured on one of the episodes of the best thing i ever ate. This $16 pizza with sunnyside up egg, speck, mozzarella and tomato sauce was delicious! It was light, not too salty and made with fresh ingredients. We also ordered a side of a $3 grilled white bread with nutella and homemade raspberry jam dipping sauces. The nutella is a must and their homemade jam was one of best jam we have ever had.	1
After a day out in the sun, on the boat, no one wants to go home and cook. So, the last few times my family and I have stopped by Atlantica for a bite (and a drink, of course). <br><br>I usually go with the conch fritters and coconut shrimp. Both made in-house, the shrimp is butterflied and crispy. The asian-glaze served for dipping is great, too. The conch fritters are somewhat spicy, but not hard to handle. Served with a tangy mayo, this is something to check out.<br><br>The ceviche is great, but only on my first visit did it have what looked like sliced papaya inside, and it was delicious. They also feature a BBQ Shrimp appetizer, but I found the sauce to be way too peppery.<br><br>My friend, Bernie, is crazy for the whole fried fish. It comes with two sides, and will run you between $20-24, depending on the fish. They also have fried fish or shrimp tacos, and fish fingers (all three dishes are served with fries). These items we tried the first time around, but haven&#39;t really found ourselves ordering again. They were good, though.<br><br>The service is always friendly, although sometimes it can get just a tiny bit slow. Sometimes there is live entertainment outside. They also feature a market in the back, but I haven&#39;t had the chance to check it out.	1
The waitstaff is very attentive and approachable but the food is very average nothing to write to Zagat Restaurants about if you catch my drift. the seating is very cramped and kind of clausterphobic feeling like if someone turned the wrong way you might get sneeze spray if they did'nt cover their mouths. The decor is very ecceletic well like the whole vibe of the restaurant. The parking is weird and hard to find. Definetly take the bus	0
First time visit for us on Valentine's Day. We were very impressed with the food.  Everything we ordered was delicious from the crab bruschetta appetizer to our shrimp parmesan and chicken and shrimp scampi entrees. The pasta that accompanied the meals was the big hit. You can taste freshness. Can't wait to go back. My only complaint is that the restaurant is really small so the tables are in close quarters. However the service was very good, even with all of the squeezing through tables.	0
Thai and delivery equals a winning combination. absolutely great Thai food delivered to your door hot spicy and by a friendly person. Can't get enough of the delicious green curry!! thanks phayathai for coming to maple leaf--we love you!!	1
Tasty spicy chicken and gyoza (the only thing I've had). I applaud them for offering brown rice but $1.25 EXTRA??	1
Now i see why everytime i come theres new staff, should be a hint to management if u cant maintain staff, If your looking for a family place stay away from here!! I&#39;ve been here numerous times and this restaurant is very small and you can hear everything that goes on in the kitchen, the language is horrible and the way someone back there talks to there employees is crazy, &#39;dumbass&#39;s, &#39;f-ing idiots&#39; and slamming stuff around and other customers jump, its nuts in there! These guys need to get there crap together its such a shame cuz the food is ok	0
Not even the hungriest, rabid infested pack of Chihuahuas would touch this food. All their food is canned process nonsense. It's like Mc Donalds on Mescaline. Now the freshly made tortillas are good, but that's it.	0
I was here the other night and it was fabulous! Had the scallops rissoto- omg it was so delicious and rich. My friend got the steak- it was a perfect medium rare! And the atmosphere was really great, busy and fun but laidback. A great addition to the neighborhood! Can&#39;t wait to come back and try the chicken and waffles.	1
owned by the same family that owns aunt kizzy&#39;s. when on the &#39;shaw get in here and get your eat on potnas!!! soul food at it&#39;s best baby. forget the diet just eat and be thankful	1
Here's a late review of our New Year's Eve dinner, prefacing with the following caveat: when you try everything on the menu, you're giving a restaurant a lot of chances to fail. In that context, I can give a pass for some slight disappointments (the rillettes were dry) when outstanding dishes are there to counterbalance. Turns out that there were several great dishes here, but the rutabaga soup was my favorite. Surprisingly, there was not much pork on the menu. Maybe less surprising for a Seattle restaurant was the fact that the vegetarian dishes were their best. Dessert was pretty good, too. Service was low-key and friendly. The decor at this historic location (Sitka &amp; Spruce, Nettletown) is, um... minimalistic. Overall, a strong recommendation bolstered by the fact that our normally $135/person pris fixe meal was priced down to $50/person on account of the holiday. Since when did restaurants *drop* their prices on big holidays?	1
Perch is such a beautiful Restaurant and Lounge! My Girlfriend and I love finding new places that are different and stand out and this restaurant is truly an amazing experience. Great Food, Great Service, and a spectacular view! Highly recommend Perch to anyone!	1
Since they re-opened in the new building, the food has gone drastically downhill. It was so authentic and delicious before - my favorite Italian place in LA - so it&#39;s heartbreaking for me. A the previous location I would&#39;ve given it 5 stars! <br><br>The cook and his wife are terrific people, and I hope they read this review and take it to heart. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the recipes, the ingredients, the preparation or all of the above, but something has clearly changed for the worse. The spaghetti carbonara was bland, cold, had no texture or flavor. The pizza was limp. Everyone at the table (four of us) agreed that their dinner was disappointing. I know the head chef is better than this. I hope someday they go back to their old quality, because unfortunately I can&#39;t go back until then. I was very disappointed on my last visit, because I used to love this place and I wish the best for the owners.	0
Hey not bad, fast, unexpensive and convenient for a friday dinner...<br><br>I Liked the pork rice and the sweet&amp;sour chicken...(classic)<br><br>Will order again anytime...	1
We were looking for a catering company for my moms birthday and decided to go with this place due to great reviews. <br>Everyone over here is really nice. We ordered a couple of different items off the menu that came out to a little more than we expected. This place isn&#39;t the cheapest. The food seemed fresh and tasted good. They had our order ready the next day, and waited after closing hours for us.<br>The only downside was that the galbi jjim we ordered seemed over priced compared to what we got. It would have been better if they packaged it in a smaller tub instead of throwing unnecessary bones in there to make it look full. <br>Since customer service was good, they saved a star from 3 to 4. <br>Would I order from them again? It&#39;s hard to say.	1
French fries crisp and addictive but superfluous! Cloudy wheat beer paired beautifully, cleansing the palate between bites! Oh, and who makes that pickle? Perfect	1
Toast is such a cute little cafe and great place for brunch. Came here on Saturday around 11:15am and the wait was less than 15 minute for a party of two. Our waitress was really nice and attentive. We decided to share a sweet entree and a savory one. Went for the strawberry banana waffle and the build your own omelette. The waffles were light and crispy on the outside. They didn't skimp on the fruits either. For the omelet we got spinach, avocado, mozzarella cheese and bacon. So good! The potatoes are served pretty well done and crispy.The OJ is freshly squeezed.	1
I ended up going to Rachel&#39;s for lunch because there are not many healthy options in the areas near the strip. <br><br>The parking situation here is a pain and even though there is a spot to use a credit card, the parking machine only takes cash and coins. <br><br>I sampled the tuna and curried chicken salad before deciding what to order. The tuna had an excess amount of mayonnaise and the chicken was dry. I looked at the menu for an additional five minutes because I did not know what to order and was skeptical because I did not think the food was up to par based on the samples. I decided on the chicken sandwich on the light menu and my friend chose the tuna even though she tried it as well and was not impressed.<br><br>The sandwich I had was poorly stacked and because the lettuce was placed on the bottom it became wilted. I did not enjoy the seasoning of the chicken which is all I could taste when eating my sandwich. My friend said her tuna was overly watery which made the tortilla soggy. She also thought there was too much tuna and additional ingredients were needed in order to combat the mushiness of the tuna.<br><br>Both times I have been to Rachel&#39;s I have found the food to be average and lazily made.	0
I didn't realize that this was pretty much an alleyway until I finally sat down at a table and looked around at where I was at. FOOD QUALITY:Their wasabi fries was good! And thank goodness that it was their fries that was really good and not just the wasabi sauce.Their Samurai burger was somewhat interesting because the flavors were mild and nice, but a little pain to it since it was stacked so high. Their meat (cooked to medium) was not very soft and only mildly juicy. Not really a fan of their burgers.However, points to their cocktails and drinks. All I know (and can remember) is that I enjoyed them and didn't cringe at any of it. Food 3.5/5. SERVICE:The waitress we got was friendly, nice, and polite. Was pretty attentive up until the point where it got really busy.ENVIRONMENT:I like the outdoor environment a lot because it is entirely relaxing during the night. Dim lighting in the outdoors, but still warm due to the space heaters. Ambiance can be a little loud due to the narrow space but for some odd reason it doesn't take away from the relaxing atmosphere.I like this place solely for its environment and drinks. I think it's a great place to just sit down and relax with some friends over a drink and possibly maybe dinner should you choose some yummies that other yelpers recommend.	1
This was a great discovery after a long day. We got the chicken drunken noodles and beef pad thai, both were plentifully large and expertly prepared. The drunken noodles were just spicy enough to remember how much you love water, and the pad Thai was a nice balance of flavors.	1
Not only does this place offer delish burgers with ramen noodles substituting the bun, but awesome customer service as well! We first tried the ramen burger at a ramen food festival in lil Tokyo, and decided it was one of the best burgers Eva! Looking for another tasty experience, we went to the actual restaurant or more closely resembling a take-out window. This time the experience was lackluster. I was really surprised that the ramen burger didn't have a lot of flavor, so I figured something must be missing. I messaged Jeffrey the business owner and told him about my experience. He offered two free burgers to make up for my past experience. When my bf and I tried the burger again, it was exactly the flavorful experience I remembered. Apparently one of the signature sauces was missing. They also threw in some free fries and drinks as well! Talk about making up for a bad experience!	1
I&#39;ve been here several times. Each time the service is slower and slower. We were the only ones in there and ordered wings. It took 50 minutes. The bar is fine. No problems. It&#39;s their kitchen. We received our food after two other groups that arrived after us. We ONLY ORDERED the wings. <br><br>The two stars is for the bar. They did however run out of Co2 without having a backup. Weird.	0
The Caesar salad was excellent, served in a crust of baked parmagian cheese.  One order is good for 2 people to share.	1
When back and the line was super long. The food seemed rushed. The favors where a little off. When I got up to order they seemed annoyed that I was asking for food. <br><br>Not sure I&#39;ll go back again soon.	0
Just tried Range for lunch and had a great experience. The staff was super helpful and made good recommendations. The space is very nice, open with lots of light near the front of the house where we sat. We had a couple sandwiches (Turkey and the veggie burger) and a salad (beet), all very tasty. I&#39;ll definitely go back and am looking forward to trying out their beer / wine / drinks list.	1
Went there not too long ago to try their mac and cheese, and it was the worst. Super stale and just not cheesy at all. Debating on whether to give this place a second chance or not. Side notes: my friend let me try some of her French toast and it was good. Second side note, their fries were decent:	0
This is going to seem petty and dumb, but...	0
This was a wonderful experience and our first time there. The house made pastas were delicious. The highlight was the superb service by David with each dish being described completely so we didn&#39;t even need to consult the menu. We definitely look forward to returning to this spot and can&#39;t wait to try some of the other dishes.	1
My new favorite breakfast spot! Parking sucks...the street is one hour parking except Sundays. But people come and go, so just be patient. And it is so worth it. Try the flapjacks, or even better the New Yorker!	1
Ordered via grubhub, and delivery was prompt. Unfortunately, the food was mediocre at best. I ordered the Spicy Garlic Caramelized Prawns, $ 10.95 and the Coconut Curry Tofu and Veggie $ 9.50. The prawn dish was decent, a bit too sweet and salty with more grease than necessary. In both dishes, the vegetables were roughly cut, without much apparent care. The prawn dish included baby carrots - the kind you buy at the supermarket to snack on. That was a bit of a red flag - if the chefs can't be bothered to cut the veggies, I have to wonder what other corners are being cut.I would nor order from Nan King again.	0
Get the potato pancake, kimchee fried rice and dumplings for your sides. Wear your bib. And they play all the 90's hip hop jams.	1
I guess one of my familys favorite Soup Place. My sis and her bf went all around korea town to find best soup place and ended back at this place as usual not too long ago. Pros1. Taste Pretty darn good and good portion!2. Clean and long Hours 3. Good Parking ( Unless you go their on weekend night, Plenty of Parking always !) 4. No wait. and okay service -never experienced bad service yet even when they are busy. Cons1. Price has been steadily going up for this place. I actually think it is bit pricy for a soup.	1
What a gem! Food is delicious and the place is beautiful. Ate there a few times and tried different dishes, all were fresh and very tasty. I especially enjoyed the Mediterranean breakfast, shakshuka, fancy grilled cheese sandwich (with tomato jam!!), and Stumptown coffee! The staff and owners are very friendly and the free wifi is a big plus!	1
Luna Park is just a few blocks away and it's a great place to go for some comfort food close to home. And yes their milkshakes ARE the best. The apple caramel is my favorite	1
Don&#39;t give up! Keeping looking for parking! This place is so worth it.<br><br>It&#39;s located down a narrow alley. Easy to miss, but not too hard to find. Went on a Sunday night and got seated very quickly. The actual place was a lot smaller than expected, but it was nicely set up with plenty of tables + heat lamps + hanging lights. <br><br>Happy Hour deals are great. Our party ordered the Moscow Mule (my favorite), Margarita, Bees Knees, and a Mojito. We enjoyed all of them; most of the cocktails were on the strong side-just as the waiter had mentioned. We also ordered the popular wasabi fries. It had a subtle kick to it, but it just wasn&#39;t our thing. We opted for no wasabi sauce on our 2nd order and it tasted just like garlic fries. Yum.<br><br>My cousins and I loved this place and we will definitely be back.	1
Look at me, eating my own words. My office orders lunch in once a week for everyone and we've been pushing for Papalote for a while. The office is at the far edge of the Financial District, almost at the Embarcadero, and Papalote is... no where near it. Shouldn't be a problem, we'll just TaskRabbit it, right? Hmmm... not quite that easy. Just to make sure, I called Paplote on Friday (for a Tuesday order) to make sure there would be no issue with paying on the phone and putting it under someone else's name to pick it up. The girl I spoke with said that wouldn't be a problem, and they only need an hour or so lead time. Monday rolls around, and I get everyone's order together to place. Call them up, give them my order, seems smooth until I try to pay. They inform me that only the manager can take payment over the phone and give me her name and tell me to call back at 11am Tuesday for an 11:30 pickup. So I call just after 11am on Tuesday. I ask to speak with the manager directly, and instead of getting a normal response, I get a question... who is that? I repeat the name I was given and am rudely informed that there is no one there with that name. I ask to speak to the manager on duty and am told they're not in yet. I inform them that I was told to call at 11am because that's when the manager would be there, and I need my food to be ready by 11:30am because I already have a TaskRabbit ready to pick it up, and this is just not okay. I hear her set the phone down and tell the "manager" everything I just said. Apparently the "manager" was there this whole time and not taking calls. The same rude girl comes back and says fine, I'll take your credit card info. (I thought only the "manager" could?) So I give it to her, and she says ok, just bring it in with you. I tell her that's not going to happen because we have someone else on their way to pick it up, I can't have them come to the office, grab my card, and then bring it all the way there just to show it, and eitherway, it's my card, and I'm not the one picking it up. As if she wasn't rude enough, she's basically yelling at me saying that they can't do it. Now it's my turn to be firm, and I tell her that she has to do this. I have a whole office of hungry people waiting, I've already set someone up to go pick it up, and she's basically lost at least 10 customers today. All in all, they finally agreed to process the order. By the time the food got here, it was a little cold, but fine. I have never experienced such horrible customer service. I was a regular here, but haven't been back since.	0
So creative and delicious! Every time I come the menu has new things. I like to go with friends and order a bunch of things to share. And don't forget the cocktails, amazing crafty tastiness! The one with the smoldering cinnamon stick is a delight for your nose and taste buds! Who would have guessed that LACMA would be hiding one of the better restaurants in LA?!	1
Excellent food and sevice. A four hour dinner that seemed like a very pleasant hour thanks to the staff's pacing of attentiona and service	1
I&#39;ve been here for brunch one day, and it was ok. BUT HAPPY HOUR! Happy hour is really good here. I normally get the sangria, which is $6 a glass, OR if you plan on drinking, get the bowl for 3 for $14.50. It&#39;s well worth it. You can easily get 3.5-4 glasses at least from it. In addition, you have to get the fries, it&#39;s $3 with 3 different kinds of sauces. Those are my two favs for happy hour here. There&#39;s always normally a dinner happy hour too, the portions are large and it looks good. The sliders were ok. The only negative is that happy hour is at the bar, so sometimes it fills up fast, so it&#39;s hard to find a seat. Otherwise, it&#39;s great, and I love going there.	1
Grade : B	1
This is why the Marina has a bad reputation. Why on earth would you wait, outside, on a cold and rainy night, for thirty minutes or more, to get into some stupid bar just because it's new and "trendy" when there are other perfectly serviceable bars RIGHT NEXT DOOR. Because it's been open for a week? And you want to say you've been there already? LAME.This bar is insanely packed, filled with people who seem to think life is one long cocktail party and who probably don't even realize this place is a Gastropub and probably has really good food. I unfortunately had to deal with all this for a friend's goodbye party or else I would never go here in the first place. I will never come here after nine again.One star for the super nice guy at the door who was doing a good job running the line and staying friendly.	0
This place made me sad I was looking forward to coming here. The staff was nice and the place looked cool but the food man....the food wasn&#39;t that good. I got tonkatsu shoyu and it had a weird off taste to it. My grandpa got the karaga and it tasted off too. The pork was good had nice flavor but was tough its like i needed a knife to cut it. :( This is the first time I had a bad review for a ramen place and it makes me sad.	0
Truthfully, I am torn in this review. The Shanghai soup dumplings were delicious. The other dumplings were just about average, definitely not mind-blowing. I consider myself a dumpling connoisseur so I know when a dumpling is legit.That said, it's a long trek to get out to this place. It's a tiny space and gets really warm inside. We had a really negative experience in terms of leaving the restaurant with less than full bellies, which is never a good sign. Please tell me if you have ever had a restaurant DENY your request to order more food. KoD denied our requests to order more food. I mean, really?! What is the business you're running? I seriously doubt I will ever come back, given the inconvenient location and how I was completely blocked from ordering more food. Yank Sing has xiao long bao that is comparable, even if it is pricier. At least I know I can eat to my heart's content there and if I need to order more, I am free to do so. Also, the man with the blow torch making creme brulee = tort suit waiting to happen. Seriously a hazard. I thought he was going to burn someone's arm, the way he was waving it around.If you don't mind the drive, then would definitely recommend going for the soup dumplings. If that's all you're after, I'd just go to Yank Sing.	0
Hmm, I must admit I was expecting good pizza judging by the reviews. <br><br>Honestly, the pizza wasn&#39;t very good... A frozen Digiorno crust is better. My whole group left feeling, wow, what a let down. <br><br>Eating outside being cooled off by powerful aerial misters, completely surrounded by traffic was pretty cool though.	0
Very very dry chicken! 18 dollars for mcdonalds quality chicken. Disappointing. The brussel sprouts salad is good though, however the portions are quite small and you won&#39;t leave feeling full if thats what you&#39;re looking for. Probably the burgers aren&#39;t bad based off the pictures. For a couple not worth $45+	0
We have been to the Inn with a large group and just as a couple, and have been very happy with the food and the service.	0
This place is great! Good service and great (local!) food. Almost everything in the restaurant is sourced from within a 360 degree radius of Seattle (there are certain things that just don't grow in the PNW, so they get them from the closest/best location possible). This is a go-to place for us when we have people visiting from out of town.	0
i just came by here tonight, this place beats the boiling crab, we walked in and right away we got a table with no waiting. the shrimp was great food is similar to boiling crab without the 1 to 2 hour wait. customer service was great also they were on top of things. this place will be my regular spot for seafood!	1
Very chill... just a nice, "easy to be" place when it isn't crowded. Great bartenders, both shifts! And, now, it just looks SO much better the the lights working. The projector seemed like overkill, particularly since it was beaming regular TV... (ok, maybe it was cable...) Live music provided for great ambiance.	1
The Kona steak is amazing.  Not sure why it adds so much flavor but this is the second time I have had it and did not disappoint.  Nice service.  Very patient with us as we poured over the wine selection.  Also very open and friendly, last time waiter was a bit stiff and patronizing.	1
I usually don&#39;t wander down to Tribeca, but my roommate tried this restaurant the other night and said it was a must. The cocktails are fun and delicious, the food was well plated and tasty and the dessert was awesome! Even more than good food, the service was really a notch above the rest...and well, they have popcorn...FREE popcorn. <br><br>Let me explain something; I make the best popcorn (EVER!), so I always try the popcorn when it&#39;s offered at the restaurant. Wow, this was so good!! I am totally going to copy the recipe. Korean hot pepper seasoning and no butter added...um, this is even healthier than my popcorn for my clients! Score. Okay, enough with the popcorn.<br><br>The wings were really just wings in my mind, and quite messy, but for the wing conesuer, you may feel differently. The two winners for me: the tuna appetizer and the scallop main course. We also had the steak (I&#39;m not a big steak eater, but the garlic bone marrow butter was different and yummy!), the mushroom side dish (wow!!) and the crusty bread (which was topped with horseradish...honestly, could have done without this and just had a plate of horseradish). <br><br>And to end things, the dessert was so good!!!!! I love s&#39;mores and this was such a cool dish! The waiter joked about how the restaurant wants to offer a kit table side with a blow torch for people to make their own s&#39;mores. Yeah, not sure how that would go over. ;-) Maybe if it were a table of tea teetotalers. <br><br>PS. the pinot noir was yum (by the glass).	1
The Perch is absolutely beautiful. The view is amazing, the way they decorated along with the arrangement of furniture is amazing, and there&#39;s a live band! I am usually annoyed with live bands but its not distracting music, its just great conversation/food eating music. <br><br>It is a bit pricey, but you&#39;re paying for the experience.	1
Definitely a local/Hipster spot. $2 Miller High Life so those looking for a deal. The backyard is nice to hang out in during warm weather months, but the inside is just a bit too grimey looking for me.	0
How can you have a world class butcher shop with dry aged beef downstairs, and not serve any dry aged meats on the menu!!!!!	0
DONT GO TO THIS PLACE. Me and my friend to to this place and it was empty with just two employees at the bar. We went to use the bathroom before we looked at the menu. The owner ask what we wanted already started with an attitude. We looked at the menu and decided to leave. The OWNER started to accuse us of just using the bathroom, which we didn&#39;t. He basically was started a fight with us, he can barely walk from how drunk he was. He called us all names in the book. The sum of it... Don&#39;t even waste your time here, I never seen so much disrespect from a business owner.	0
This place is nothing to brag about! The menu is overwhelming, too much going on in it. The nachos taste like they have Pace salsa and cheese whiz, the skirt stake was too salty, and the pizza and lamb tacos were extremely greasy! <br><br>The service is horrible! 40 minutes for a burger and stake is absurd, and the food was cold. The wait staff took some time asking us for drink orders so we had to place them at the bar. <br><br>Overall, I would not recommend this place to eat. You can get better tasting food and service some place else.	0
this place could be so much better, the food and the services was very good and fast. but the prices and the decorations were very disappointed, everything look very old and out dated, plus the sides didnt have prices on the menu and when the bill came a single side of mashed potatoes was 7.5!!!! i think it is the most expensive mashed potatoes in town, and it was very simple and plain nothing special. Also one of waitress was looking at my phone when i was on groupon and asked me to redeem my coupon when i told him i didnt even bought it yet?!?! i still dont understand why was he looking at my phone neither the urge to redeem my groupon when i was still eating. i think this place have good potential but they have lots of work and good training to do.	0
Fine I'll give them 2.5 stars, I was really not impressed. I had the 5 spice chicken Ban mee. The chicken was moist but it needed more spice in the chicken. Overall the sandwich tasted fresh and not as fatty as a authentic Ban mee but it's missing the salty pate. The pate should be in ALL the sandwiches. I was craving papaya salad so I got it and was majorly disappointed. They added vermicelli noodles in the salad which is so not supposed to be in there at all. There was a few slivers of papaya and all noodles and peanuts. I also didn't taste any shrimp paste in the sauce or saw any dry shrimp in it. This place is obviously catered to rich white folks. No way in hell should my meal be $10.I was watching the Mexican chefs cooking all the Vietnamese food and noticed the sweet potato fries are frozen out of a plastic bag.	0
We&#39;ve been here numerous times and love it! The staff Is always super sweet and the chef is on point. Really good vibes in here always. Today we popped in for brunch and yum yum yum. I&#39;m really excited for summer time patio meals when it warns up. This has definitely become one if my neighborhood favorites.	1
This was our forth visit to the Capital Grille, Las Vegas, and we have never been disappointed.  For Starters, try the calamari, prepared with peppers to add a little heat, without being overpowering, lightly breaded, a great choice. The lobster bisque soup was also excellent, with a creamy broth and ample pieces of lobster. The mainstay of the Capital Grille is steaks, which were prepared exactly to order.  For a restaurant in a beautiful room overlooking the Las Vegas Strip they might be able to offer merely good food and average service, but they never do.  Our server was, friendly, professional, attentive and very knowledgeable about the menu and wine list. A great choice for fine dining in Las Vegas, we will definitely be back.	1
I've been traveling around the Los Angeles Downtown area and I just happened to want a burger while walking by it so I went. I really didn't expect much but since the I could customize my burger, it was perfect for me. The bun was really good and they got me the exact medium beef I had asked for. Their fries were hot and crunchy which was just A-mazing! I totally recommend this place if you're near-by. However some of you might not enjoy it as much as I did because it's basically the same as any other custom burgers. Still, the burger was really tasty. My husband says that we should come here again if we visit Los Angeles again.	1
The food is perfect. Please grease the guy at the front door regardless if its busy or not because he really works hard and. Deserves it. The bathroom floors are moped with bacon grease so be careful. You&#39;re not an Angelinos if you don&#39;t love it. FYI	1
My wife and I had the salt caramel ice cream after our lunch today in Colombia City. 	1
The bartender was on her cellphone while working, Friday July, 11th. 2014. Instead of paying attention of her job	0
Drop whatever restaurant you were thinking of and just go here. Beautiful restaurant, bar, with equally beautiful food. You will not be sorry! The Niscoise Salad is the most beautiful one I have seen, the Tartare is one the best I've had. I can't say enough- what a lovely experience.	1
Very nice atmosphere, very tasty food that came out incredibly fast. The prices aren&#39;t too high for Chicago downtown. I am definitely coming back :)	1
This is a small place that smells like chicken. There. This sentence defines the place. Oh, ok ok, I&#39;ll tell you my whole experience there.<br><br>So I went there this afternoon, hungry, with my friend who read about this place and said that it was supposed to be really good. I hate when people tell me that because it&#39;s usually hype.<br>There was a line inside and another outside. We went to the line inside. A bunch of strange looking people were devouring their chicken like dinosaurs probably did millions of years ago.<br>On my turn, we requested for the &#34;famous&#34; chicken plate and a hamburger for me, since I was disgusted by the animalistic way people were eating their chicken. The little guy mumbled something like it was going to take a while since they didn&#39;t have it ready and walked away looking mad. <br>Are you serious? A trash place like that can afford servers to give you attitude? Really? I was shocked.<br>I stared at the smoke coming out of the mountain of pounds and pounds of chicken being cooked and felt sick. Really sick. The smell of it was killing me. I told my friend &#34;How can you eat that?&#34; and canceled my burger. Actually, it wasn&#39;t that easy. My friend told them &#34;only the chicken, no more hamburger&#34; and the guy goes &#34;It&#39;s almost ready&#34;.<br>He messed with the wrong person.<br>&#34;What do you mean they can&#39;t cancel?&#34; I said to my friend. They only had put the buns down to cook! <br>I was even more grossed out because I asked for a burger and was going to get one that smelled like chicken.<br>So I saw the same idiot who told me &#34;no&#34; going to the other one with a spatula in hand, and the latter looked at me. And then another one. And the manager stared at me too.<br>Oh, I am sorry that no one has ever rejected that crap you call food.<br>My friend paid for the chicken and we left.<br>Later I was offered a piece of the chicken since I was still hungry and I took a bite of that disgusting-looking chicken.<br>The two stars go to that. The chicken was alright.<br>Not worth the hype though.	0
Simply delicious! The meat is perfectly cooked as you order it, the sides and sauces are amazing! LOVE IT! Even though some people complain that the burger size is small--and that was my first reaction when I saw it--it is the perfect portion!!	1
Do not order online. Just did it and the order never came. After one 1hr waiting, I called and the driver was on his way. 15mins more, and the driver was still coming. after 1:30hr I had to cancel the order. Thanks 10Fruits, for never delivering my order...	0
I do think they make a good burger but not good enough for those lines. You need to make the greatest burger ever for that kind of cramped wait and these are not the greatest burgers ever. However I went to the Red Mill in Interbay and experience no line friendly service and great food.	0
Amazing!!! <br><br>Don&#39;t let the size of this place fool you, it&#39;s small but but the food packs a punch. This was my first time trying Filipino food. I had the kaldereta backa( it&#39;s like beef stew ) the sauce is this light tomato paste with coconut milk, delicious. Not overly sweet.The rice was cooked within coconut and garlic, fantastic. <br><br>The service was outstanding. She broke down the menu dish by dish. Also we had such a great conversation, even the cook came out to see if we needed anything else and converse with us. <br><br>In making this a regular spot!	1
Would have expected better food as it is quite PRICEY	1
Nice ambience. I thought the integration of barbers and butchers was palpable with the assortment of props.Food well made. Short rib sandwich was a bit short on the ribs...mouthful of bread with each bite. Trout muffins was flavorful. Drinks made with effort. Nice big square ice cubes put in drinks which I love.	1
THE coolest bar I've ever been to. Insane gin selection and very eclectic selection of other liquors. Small intimate friendly and nearly unfindable.	1
Food: 2Decor: 3Service: 4Came here for a dinner date around 9pm. They had some seats open, so we were able to grab a table without a wait.1. Pimm's Cup, 8~Okay.2. Grilled Little Gems, 10Market oranges, raw goat's milk feta & oregon hazelnuts~Okay. The feta with oranges was a bit odd.3. Market Mushrooms, 16Cave aged gruyere, thyme & roasted onions~Disappointing. Really didn't like the pizza at all, and any other pizza on the menu probably would have been better. Bit surprised that the server recommended this one as the most popular pizza.Service was good.	0
Happy Hour Review$1 Oysters-not cleaned well, found sand and even a little bug (some green wiggly worm the size of an ant)Goat Cheese Dip w/ Old Bay potato chips-uneven seasoning on chips, portions were also inconsistent across each order (one table was almost 3x our amount of chips), dip itself was solidDrink and food is on the pricier side and they don't have happy hour food optionsOverall ThoughtsBeautiful atmosphere with amazing views but the price point seems unjustifiable	0
Jason and his team at Food Factory have been preparing healthy meals for me the last month in my quest to lose weight and feel better. Besides being healthy, they taste great and are reasonably priced. The fact that I now look forward to eating vegetables is a credit to Jason&#39;s skill as a chef. <br><br>The atmosphere at Food Factory is laid back casual and the service is excellent. Food Factory is located inside Spectators at the corner of Durango and Flamingo.<br><br>Check it out !	1
This little jewel off the beat and path is delicious, the food is so yummy. Love their morning mangu. Sancocho is as close to being in the Dominican Republic.	1
The restaurant and dinner were good as usual, can't go wrong with the Chart House. However, service on this particular night was slow as it took close to 30 minutes for our  starter salads to arrive. Despite, the waiter was gracious enough to keep us informed that the kitchen was backed up. We will continue to frequent the Chart House.	1
I think this has to be my most favorite restaurant in Baltimore! The ambiance is beautiful and the food and service is always consistently excellent! Definitely top of my list for a romantic date or special occasion!	0
Don't know what happened but this place is pretty terrible now. It used to be so good too. I picked up some food as usual- dumplings, veg fried rice, generals chicken, ate it when I got home and felt sick after. No good. Never eating there again	0
Great salmon lasagna and duck stroganoff. Who would have thought in Fall City.	1
Tried it out for thr first time and we fell in love with the bar. The bartender was the most outgoing, friendly girl we&#39;ve ever met. The manager (Sal) is truly dedicated to making this place successful and providing a personalized experience for everyone who comes in. HIGHLY recommended, coming from someone with 10 years F&amp;B experience.	1
Uninspired bland overpriced. Any other questions? We had the heirloom tomato salad which was a few tomatoes with mozzarella and basil. Not good. Very bland. Then came the beet gazpacho soup. It had clashing flavors of beet basil and spice. Finally came the main entree the grilled pork chop. Slightly overlooked bland and uninaginative. The booths are unconformatable and cramped.	0
Great food! I had the Bahn mi burger (a burger with an &#34;Asian&#34; flavour): delicious. The meat especially, is very tasty. <br>Only cons: we had to wait a little bit more than normal even if there were only a few clients. But nothing serious. <br>Plus: wifi free access and very good fries (not heavy, just perfect).	1
I love this bar. The drinks are strong and worth the price. The crowd is a mix of mid 20&#39;s to 30&#39;s, &amp; the decor is cute and vintage. I suggest coming here a bit early into the night, so you can get a good seat by the fire place or on the couches. The only negative aspect is how loud it can get.	1
I came here for a late brunch with my sister because we only live a few blocks away. This was my first time eating here, and I was NOT disappointed! The service was friendly and full of enthusiasm. Lots of smiles all around. :) I ordered the granola french toast which comes with four very large slices, with just a touch of powdered sugar garnished with strawberries and a mint leaf. My sister ordered the salt cod scrambled eggs accompanied with a bed of arugula and multi-grain toast. We couldn&#39;t think of a better way to start our day! Definitely going back. What a piece of heaven!	1
The set menu for Valentine's Day 2014 was just okay but I get that it's difficult to pull something like that off cost-effectively. I wouldn't do it again to be honest but I will definitely give their full menu another shot. The appetizers at the bar that I tried a few months back were intriguing, as is the extensive wine list. Some yummy specialty drinks on offer here as well. The top rate service definitely makes this place feel special. Was here for a special occasion in late November and they gave me a box of truffles!	0
The first time I was in SF in 2001, I enjoyed the clam chowder and fried shrimp. I thought these street vendors were a daily street fair. How exciting.Last month I returned and I wished I had an extra pair of hands, these sidewalk stands deserve four thumbs down. The clam chowder I had was barely edible (thick oatmeal). It makes me realize that I'd rather be in NY buying a hot dog sitting in boiled water from a cart.This place is tied with NYC Times Square in terms of worthless crap for tourists to buy.IFHTP 3+	0
I stay at the Four Seasons about once a month for work, and I absolutely love The Press. The service is impeccable (as it is throughout the hotel) and the food is delicious. I&#39;ve stopped by for breakfast, drinks, and dessert, and greatly enjoyed them all. The last time I was in town I shared the cronuts and banana split with some coworkers. The cronuts were a bit too cold for my colleague&#39;s liking, and the manager was extremely apologetic and rushed us out some fresh ones. I can&#39;t say enough good things about the Four Seasons or any of its amenities!	1
I have walked by this place a few times and just based on looks, I never wanted to eat there. It doesn&#39;t strike me as a place that serves good food. Well ever heard don&#39;t judge a book by its cover?<br><br>The two guys working there seemed pleasant (this was around 12:30am) and the food was really good. I had the steak and carnitas taco, plus some steak combination taco. All the meat, onions and peppers are cooked right there. It was all tasty and delicious! And cheap. For roughly ten dollars we had 5 great tacos! I recommend going here for a late night munchie......or at any time for that matter.	1
Found the food bland did not have the same complex flavors you expect with thai food	0
I am picky about Italian food, I can't help it I am an italian new Yorker!! Four of went here for dinner on a Saturday night. Portions are definitely large, drinks yummy. We shared 2 apps and were kinda full when dinner came...food was really, really good! Service, slow....friendly and efficient, but slow........was a bit annoying for drinks but was kinda nice to have have some extra time between apps and dinner. I strongly recommend	0
This used to be one of our favorite places, we&#39;d come here all the time because it was cheap and healthy food. Prices have come up during the years.<br>Another thing that&#39;s unique and kind of cool is that it&#39;s sort of two restaurants in one, you can order from either the &#34;Chinois Chinois&#34; (Chinese/Pan-Asian), or Baklava Factory&#39;s menu. We like them both.	0
We thought the food is amazing. But it is kind of disappointed compared to other Michelin one star Restaurant. The food is not bad. But just not a Michelin One star restaurant. There are definitely many other better options in Williamsburg.	0
Wow!<br><br>Wasn&#39;t sure what I was getting myself into with this place but was very surprised! French Fries that have that golden brown almost carmalized sweet balance where they bend but aren&#39;t soggy with a mountain of goodness carefully slapped on top!!<br><br>I went with the Korean BBQ as it was popular and have to tell you that the pork belly was fantastic!! Yes it has a jelatinous fat strip on it but it is pork belly afterall!! Do it!!!<br><br>Considering this place recently popped up after Hot Doug&#39;s closing means a new gem in the area and BEST OF ALL... VERY REASONABLY PRICED!! Less than $10 for a canned S. Pelligrino &amp; meal makes this place a regular choice for me.	1
Just went here with a few friends to sip on some coffee and talk and it was wonderful. I wasn't a huge fan of their sencha green tea which is what i ordered, however loved all of their pastries--especially their almond croissant and sea salt w gyurere cheese croissant. Delicious and the place is adorable considering the neighborhood is not so lovely. I would definitely come back here again.	1
Two stars only because the patio for brunch was lovely. I wanted to take my mother to brunch since I&#39;d never been and she is from England and I&#39;ve heard really nice things. <br>The awkwardness started with the moment the wait staff. Our waitress was very robotic when she spoke to us from the get go and when we told her it was our first time here she sort of just waltzed off. <br>I ordered the &#34;full english&#34; and christ whoever thought they could get away with calling it as such is out of their mind. I know the restaurant is supposed to be upscale and portions are usually scaled down in these settings. They didn&#39;t even get the recipe right. The tomatoes were &#39;stewed&#39; and tasted like they came out of a can. Full english tomato are fried. The sausage was a chunk of italian, which I need not say more. The beans filled the majority of my already very small $15 plate and they had absolutely no flavor. No bacon rashers to be seen.<br>The only part I slightly enjoyed was the toast and eggs. But I could have made those at home for much less than that price and way more flavor. <br>It was really underwhelming<br><br>My mum had a laugh because she kept wondering where the other half of her brie sandwich was. I would definitely never go back. The quality of the food and service does not even come close to the price. I live in the neighborhood and it seems like a lot of the veteran restaurants were able to stagnate on the quality after gaining popularity because they were the only ones in town. Now that there are pop ups every week I fear for these OG&#39;s. Reputation only lasts so long.	0
First the good: This is a nice and well appointed restaurant, pleasant atmosphere,  good food and service. Count on a bill of at least $100 per head.At this price point, we were surprised that the water served at the table had a strong Chlorine taste, a feature not found, say, at Olive Garden. Couldn't they invest in a $200 water filter? And why can't you get a basket of bread or rolls without additional charge? Are margins so tight that there is no room for a 50-cent roll in a charge of $70 for a few slices of jamon?These guys could still work out a few kinks to improve the customer experience.	1
Been here a few times and really enjoyed the food so when it came time to host a dinner party for a very special occasion, we agreed this would be the place.<br><br>WHAT A MISTAKE!!! The evening was fine but can you imagine our embarrassment when the next day, EVERYONE we talked to who had been at the dinner the night before got sick! A few even had to go to urgent care or their doctors, including a toddler! The only two who didn&#39;t get sick was my fiance and I because we didn&#39;t really eat; too busy playing hosts.<br><br>As if our party getting sick wasn&#39;t bad enough, the way we were treated afterwards by Guelaguetza was even worse. The very next day, we made them aware of the situation and let them know we&#39;d have to report this to the City. They said &#34;of course&#34; and also they would &#34;look into the situation.&#34; There was NO follow up, NO accountability and NO professionalism. The female manager even started screening and avoiding our calls.<br><br>My fiance dropped in multiple times only to see her &#34;hiding&#34; in her office when he was being told to his face that she wasn&#39;t there. Finally, she came out, gave him $200 in cash to make him go away. Not even a dent in our almost $900 bill but this was never about the money. <br><br>SHAME ON YOU, GUELAGUETZA! Not very impressive for such a landmark type of establishment. Needless to say, we&#39;ll never go back.	0
Totally great food, great vibe, but I could have done without the hostess/host making a huge stink about my friend and I having "no reservations". "No reservations!" they kept publicly yelling to each other to communicate as they tried to find us a seat. It bordered on a little public-shame'y, but eventually you came through and seated us in a cool spot. Just next time, be more quiet and don't be so weird. Service from that point was very good, and so was the food. 4 stars.	1
Chef kills it everytime.<br>The cod and pei mussels were so good I wanted to punch them in the face.<br>Fantastic meal in a setting that can&#39;t be beat.<br>All I want to do is drink more bubbly and eat tiny bites and kiss my sweet boyfriend.	1
The food is excellent,, our waiter was helpful,, nice, had a sense of humor. Took his time explaining to us what to order , how they could prepare it for me, I do not like onions, blu cheese, vinagrete, or romaine lettuce as my husband put's it I'm picky,,  I beleive his name was Byron , was accommodating and patient with me, and had an arugula salad prepared with a light ranch dressing, and pine nuts, Loved it !!! Then dessert,, came with Monkey bread,, my husband had bragged about how good it was from 3 yrs. ago,, I did not get a peice.. so Byron said he'd make sure I got sme this time and sat the plate in front of me,,, OML,,, the best I'd ever had !!!!! we WILL be going back !!!!!!  We ordered The Wagnu Beef dinner that's a sampling of 3 salads (diners choice), 3 sides (diners choice), 2 cut's of meat (diners choice) and dessert 3 (chefs choice)  Worth every penny !!!	1
Unable to make reservations and greeted at the door by a robotic, programmed &#34;hi&#34; in an atmosphere of unhappy, impersonal staff, tight space constantly being tossed and knocked about. The menu is small and forget about dining there if you are a vegetarian. The price did not match the level of service and the food, tiny portions that are all pre-made. To sum it all up, their tomato soup to accompany your tuna melt was a can of Cambells but they were not even able to tell me if they added milk or water to the pre-made batch. Disappointment is an understatement.	0
Mmmm I love sandwiches and this place sure hits the spot. The food is fresh and definitely worth the wait.	0
What a big disappointment. The food is terrible, and the place is kind of tucked away in nowhere land next to Hollywood. Aren&#39;t there any good brunch spots left in LA?	0
I am ambivalent about Paper or Plastik. <br><br>--On the one hand, the inside looks a lot like Colectivo Coffee by the lake in Milwaukee (the old flushing station), which made me feel very at home. (Other reviewers are calling the decor &#34;hipster.&#34; I think that&#39;s cute--what is normal to Milwaukeeans is hipster to Angelinos). <br><br>--On the other hand, the prices are outrageous. A cup of coffee for over $4? Really? On what planet is ordering a latte over a cup of coffee a cost-saving measure? Oh, Los Angeles, you kill me. <br><br>--But the blueberry pop tart pastry is yumtastic. <br><br>--But the breakfast plate, while good, is $12, and a bowl of soup is $11. (The guy next to me ate only a little bit of his soup because it reminded him of baby food. I didn&#39;t try it).<br><br>--But the sweet potato &amp; French feta sandwich is tasty and unique. I wouldn&#39;t have come up with that combination, and it really really worked. <br><br>See why I&#39;m torn?	1
Oh Little Dom's, how I LOVE your big juicy balls!So I finally got to try Little Dom's! (Yay!!) I've been waiting for this meal since I ran into the chefs at the Taste of Culver City last year and they told me they were opening up an East side joint. Then, as shittaaay luck would have it, it was opening right around the time I was moving and I never had a chance to try it. But this week, it was on!! I rounded up a gaggle of gals and we headed over to try their offerings and of course the amazing cheesy risotto balls that made Dominic's so famous. We also tried the margarita pizza (deeelish), the parpadelle pasta with sausage and peas (pretty good) and the fried shrimp and artichoke appetizer. Sadly that last dish was a disappointment for me. The shrimp was totally overcooked and while the artichoke tips were done well, it just wasn't my favorite dish and not worth the money.Now, as if the yummy edible standouts weren't enough, they happen to carry the very hard to find and UH-MAZING 2004 Topanga Syrah. I have looked everywhere for this wine and there it was, right on the list smiling at me. Soooo rad!As for the looks of the place, it's cool and vibey. I am always a fan of places with great amber ambiance in their lighting and this place definitely has it. Our server was also really sweet and the fact that she geeked out with me over how awesome the Topanga Syrah was, made her super cool in my book.I would definitely come back again and try some of the other dishes or even just grab a yummy glass of vino at the bar. :)	1
I&#39;m typically in agreement with review averages for businesses on Yelp but in the case of Big Wong King, I&#39;m happy to go against the grain if I&#39;m able to warn people away from a terrible meal and sketchy service. <br><br>Upon entering, expect to be greeted by the exotic scent of smoldering garbage juice and deep fryers paired with a visually stimulating assortment of poultry hanging provocatively by their gullets. This is par for the course in Chinatown and some might even thrill at the authenticity of this sort of divey eatery. I&#39;m indifferent as long as the food tastes good. <br><br>Unfortunately, it doesn&#39;t. We came in around 8:30pm and were immediately informed that they close at 9pm... a rarity in our late night city but one we could accommodate. I was immediately surprised by the prices. A $20 entree deserves at least some napkins on the table, air conditioning... maybe even service that exceeded goading us every 20 seconds into ordering. The woman stood over my date and I while we hurried to sort out the whos and whats of the menu, finally settling on some roast pork lo mein noodles, bok choy and the Yelp recommended roast duck. The duck came out first, glistening attractively... and that was the best part: not eating it. Once we actually dug in we both were left with a bland, greasy, cold mouth of gross. Look, I love duck. I&#39;ve cooked it myself many times and eaten duck at countless Chinese restaurants. This was the rudest thing they could have done to the poor thing. The bok choy was similarly soaked in tasteless vats of grease. The noodles were the only slightly redeeming factor but only in that they had some savory roast pork flavor and were warm, if not retaining a slight air of having been recently re-warmed up. <br><br>The waitress continued to bark at us even as we attempted to chew and swallow the slimy meal, until we forked over some cash and they began putting the chairs on tables and mopping around us at approximately 8:50pm. <br><br>While comical in its terribleness, I&#39;d rather go to a comedy club for a laugh and Joe&#39;s for my meal. Avoid.	0
The best sushi possible at this price point! Made by japanese bare hands. Long wait line sometimes, but always worth it. I can't recommend this place enough. I also recommend eating at the bar. The sushi nigiri style is tops. Green muscles are fantastic. Favorite nigiri would have to be the halibut with ponzu sauce. Lastly, you can request to drink while you wait ;)I'd eat here everyday if god would let me.	1
great Pad Thai!	1
Great food and service!!!!	1
Excellent view, friendly service &amp; great food!	1
Went last year for my birthday. It was meh. It was rather expensive, servers were more attentive to those that appeared to be $$$$. Their food was bland and basic in comparison to other vegan restaurants. I&#39;d suggest this as a last resort.	0
Chicken fried steak was amazing.	1
I was just walking around the area one day, became famished and this was the first decent place I came across.The cute patio caught my eye, even though it was a little chilly for me to sit out there. The interior is really cool, kinda vintage style. Very open with a great bar across an entire wall. I was alone so I sat at the bar and browsed the brunch menu. The short rib hash was the only thing that sounded amazing and out of the ordinary for brunch fare. So that's what I went with.Service was attentive, but food came out at a snails pace. Good with refills while I waited. When it came out the small portion was the first thing I noticed. The egg looked overcooked. I wasn't asked how I wanted my eggs cooked but with any hash eggs will usually come a little runny at the least. One of my eggs had a little run to the yolk but the rest of the egg portion was done crispy. Not my style. As I ate I was underwhelmed overall... The short rib meat was tasteless and kinda dry. The arugula was the only flavor that stood out in the dish, really?!? No herbs or seasoning, just a bunch of ingredients thrown together. I ended up throwing salt and hot sauce all over it.And for price of $18 (not including tip) that will do it for me. Also very poor selection of beer for having such an awesome looking bar. No draft:( Just a whole load of fancy cocktails that I'm not really into.	0
Saw a line to this place so I pulled over to get in it. Looked it up on yelp and it was worth every moment. I got the Caribbean sandwich. It was very messy, but ridiculously tasty ! It is worth the mess.  Cash only !	0
Welp... this is my first Yelp! ...heh... that rhymed... anyway..<br><br>I wanted the Apple Pan to be good... I was so excited that the hubby and I were in the area and craving a burger, and we were finally going to eat there after hearing about all the hype from people... My husband and I went in and ordered the same thing... the steakburger and french fries. The smell from the grill and frying of french fries was promising... we ordered, got our food super quickly and began to eat. But then... sadness...<br><br>The best way to sum up our experience was extremely UNDER-whelming. <br><br>The burger is OK... just that...OK. It would have been better if it didn&#39;t cost a whopping $7.25 plus an ADDITIONAL $.50 for cheese, so a total of $7.75 (and that doesn&#39;t include tax!) for a burger that I would have been happy paying MAYBE $3.00 for... and honestly, I think In-N-Out, The Habit, or Five Guys is much better and at a much better price! <br><br>The meat is of decent quality (I think... I could barely taste it, honestly) and they at least apparently use Tillamook cheese, but the bun is nothing special, the &#34;special sauce&#34; is literally just relish mixed with ketchup (and there is a giant mess of it on the burger), and there is so little cheese on it you almost HAVE to order double cheese (an additional $1.00!) to even taste anything. Most of the burger is comprised of lettuce and sauce... For nearly $8.00 I&#39;m not expecting Umami status, but damn, I&#39;d like to taste something besides the relish, ketchup and lettuce! I felt like this was something I could have made at home for way less and would have probably tasted way better too. <br><br>The fries are nothing to write home about... First of all, they are an additional $2.75 and I&#39;m not even sure they&#39;re fresh cut, they didn&#39;t seem like it. And again, I think In-N-Out, The Habit, or Five Guys is much better. <br><br>We didn&#39;t even bother with pie... At $6.00 for ONE SLICE I was much happier going to Simplethings up the road in Westwood Village, or even The Pie Hole back in our neck of the woods in DTLA (we decided on Simplethings and it did not disappoint, but I digress...).<br><br>So why 2 stars and not just 1 star? There are a FEW redeeming qualities... The first is that it was really, really quick. We ordered and got our food maybe 5 minutes later (now I&#39;m thinking about it though, not sure if that&#39;s a good thing...). The second is that even though the waiter does not seem to be paying attention to you, he is. It&#39;s kind of amazing to watch, really. He knew when we needed water, heard my order even though I was convinced he wasn&#39;t listening/couldn&#39;t hear us, and got you anything you might need. The third is that it is a cool little place to see. It&#39;s only counter service, and it&#39;s a counter that wraps around the grill area in the middle. It makes you feel like you&#39;ve gone back in time. <br><br>When all is said and done, I will not personally go back, and I very much regret the $25.00 I paid for my food. I could have easily had a better burger at a better price. I will also not recommend it to anyone unless they fancy dropping nearly $30.00 on a burger and fries that are just really not worth it. Maybe $25.00 for two burgers, fries, and two cups of water isn&#39;t a big deal to you, but for me it better set a new standard of what a burger is if I&#39;m forking out that kind of dough.	0
Vaca Frita was outstanding. Great service and the agua de melon was probably the best I&#39;ve ever had!	1
One of my very favorite places! Please don't come here and expect Pizza Hut or your everyday, run of the mill pizza. It's gourmet! And yes, you are going to pay a little more for it - seriously don't let that discourage you. The simple and fresh ingredients are the very best and are paired with an expert palate.	0
The perch is hands down one of my favorite brunch places so far. What&#39;s better than brunch and a view? I went here on Sunday around 1pm without reservations (tried calling but all calls went to voicemail). We explained the situation to the person in front and they were extremely accommodating. We got seated almost immediately! Considering how busy they were for brunch, the service was on point. <br><br>As soon as my group sat down, we ordered a couple mimosas and bloody marys, which were really good. The Bloody Mary was spicy, but not too overwhelming. As for food, I got the #13 Benedict, which was the simple eggs benedict over Canadian bacon with potatoes on the side. In addition to that, our server (unfortunately I forgot her name) gave us the truffle fries as a free appetizer dish! Probably the best truffle fries I&#39;ve ever put in my mouth. It also came with a pesto sauce on the side, which was so flavorful. Honestly, these fries alone are enough for me to come back here but the entire meal was like heaven in my mouth.<br><br>Overall: good food, good service and an amazing view to top it all off! I&#39;m not not sure if they do this all the time, but there was also a live band performing during brunch time. I would definitely recommend this place!	1
Came here for brunch one morning and tried the breakfast sandwich; eggs, cheddar cheese, arugula, bacon and jam on a chive biscuit. Yum! It was the perfect size too; filing but not too much. Just the breakfast sandwich was $7.50..... worth it for something different to have occasionally. Also, I got a cold Chai tea which they make from liquid concentrate and not the powder. It was good; I prefer the concentrate vs the powder. Powder Chai doesn't blend well.	1
Who would&#39;ve thunk that I would find a good Argentinean/Brazilian BBQ in the heart of Koreatown??!!<br>Korean owners, cooks so I was skeptical. Sue Me.<br>I bought a lunch special. Beef, Chorizo and sliced Pork Belly. <br>Verdict- <br>I&#39;m not a pork belly enthusiast, but it was more tender than I&#39;ve had in the past, but still I&#39;ll pass. <br>Chorizo- tasty but not my thing.<br>The star of the show is the beef! Delicious! Pour the traditional green sauce on top(forgot the name) but yum yum good. Rice and beans ok. <br>4 stars for the beef! Gonna come back just to order the beef. Need to try the empanadas next time. They were out. :-(	1
I've been going for over 20 years.A Hickory Burger, Fries, a Coke and a Slice of Apple Pie is my go to order and reminds me of UCLA days. Love the Hickory Sauce. French Fries done just right! Apple Pie is delicious.Other faves are the Tuna or the Egg Sandwiches, Banana Cream and the Pecan Pies.The line moves fast and is worth the wait.	1
I had Crunchy French Toast and Blueberry Pancake for brunch today. These were amazingly delicious. My server was nice. But I would &#34;never&#34; visit this place again because of the terribly unkind hostess (African American with red hair). She ruined my happy Saturday brunch. <br><br>I just asked her twice whether she called my name. I asked twice because when I asked her for the first time, there were only two parties ahead of me, and I left and came back after about 10 min to put coins in the parking meter. She replied me back, &#34;you just asked the question.&#34; I should have replied her back, &#34;So what? What&#39;s this attitude? Can you just answer my question one more time?&#34; But I couldn&#39;t because I was very shocked by her attitude and didn&#39;t wanna deal with her attitude any more. I asked what her name is and she refused to give her name. She was very rude when I asked my first question too.	0
my husband and I were in Vegas for the weekend and had dinner at cut our first night there. Dominic and Richard were our servers for the evening and they were absolutely fantastic. They were funny and friendly and very personable and I would recommend this restaurant based just on the excellent service we received. The food and presentation was very good as well.	1
Two words: Super Burrito. It may not be as big as your head, but its as big as your late night appetite. I suggest the steak version without beans. However, they're very accommodating, so have them throw in some chorizo if you're feeling wiley.	0
the food here is delicious! there is a decent variety of mediterranean food - we got a gyro and a mixed kebob and it was Turkish style, which is exactly what we wanted! the prices are great especially for how much food you get. i will definitely go here again.	1
I see good things for this place. Drinks were great. Fries and sauces were great. Napa salad was fantastic. Love that dressing. The Lake Tahoe was delicious. The Santa Barbara flatbread was the only weak spot. The toppings were great, the flatbread is in need of some flavor adjustments. I wish the seats had backs but oh well. Service was kind and attentive.	1
The two stars is NOT for the food. The food is GREAT.<br><br>This is for the quality of drinks post 11pm at the place. Suddenly, the place changed from a joint where people respect the things they are making for you to a place where you are going to get boozy insipid cocktails for your 12 dollars.<br><br>I hate boozy cocktails. It always feels like that the bartender can&#39;t be bothered to put an effort so she puts in an extra shot of tequila in your drink, so you can shut up and drink it and not complain. It was rather sad.<br><br>There was also an error in billing which was really infuriating as they charged me for an extra drink and when I mentioned the error, the cheaper drink was taken off the bill instead of the drink that should have been removed. Agreed, the cheaper drink was only a dollar less but still, it felt wrong. i got no apologies. Just a look that said, &#34;pay your damn bill and get out.&#34;	0
I've been a fan for years.Today is donut appreciation day and Lanes makes the best. The only reason I don't go more often is my clothes. I'd have to buy larger ones and can't afford it.	0
Came in with my bf last night around 10 and must say that it exceeded my expectations! I have always had great experiences here, and our server Cameron was very bubbly and knew the menu well. We ordered smothered and sloppy fries (both amazing!), the Cali burger, and the traditional Truffle burger... SO good! People who write bad reviews about portion/pricing should go to Jack in the Box around the corner- you get what you pay for, and Umami delivers every time! Thanks Cameron!	1
Cozy spot. I went at around 3:30pm on a Thursday and it wasn&#39;t busy at all. I got a chocolate chip pecan cookie (which was huge-- like 5 inches in diameter) and it was really yummy. Also ordered a cappuccino to go with it, and it was brought to where I was sitting. It took a bit to get to me, but I appreciated the time spent on a nice cup of cappuccino. Both items tasted super fresh to me and nicely presented on their own little ceramic plates. The cashier was polite and didn&#39;t make me feel uncomfortable when I took my time staring at the pastry display deciding on what to get. My total came up to $5.25, which I personally find reasonable for a good pastry and coffee PLUS a place to sit in the city.	1
Best gourmet pizza in town. Fresh veggies and other ingredients. Not greasy. Excellent deep dish crust and flavorful sauce. They don&#39;t add too much salt, so the flavors really come through. Whole wheat crust available. Great cheese and garlic bread loaves.	1
The Spotted Pig was a cruel letdown. After a 1.5 hr wait that turned out to be a 2 hr wait (to while away the hours, walk half a block west to Orient Express, where they make excellent cocktails), we got seated at an awkward table upstairs. My companion and I had to sit side-by-side against the wall facing other diners, with him trying to balance on the seam of the sofa. The pickles were inedibly salty. The stracciatella cheese appetizer was also doused in salt; the squash it was served over was saturated with a sharp vinegar that anesthetized our tastebuds for the duration of the dinner. The roquefort burger was meaningless; the meat insipid and the roquefort overpowering. The crispy skin on the pork belly was the consistency of shoe leather, i.e. impossible to cut with a knife (we brought it home, where our dog thoroughly enjoyed gnawing on it.) The shoestring fries got cold in about 30 seconds as they tend to do, having no substance at all. The waiter sneered &#34;no&#34; when I asked for mayonnaise (apparently, they don&#39;t &#34;do&#34; mayonnaise - like it&#39;s some kind of specialty fetish.) We couldn&#39;t ask for the check fast enough. <br><br>This is the worst example of a restaurant hype gone bad. They&#39;re clearly serving more folks than they can cook for. I regret the 2 hours, because there&#39;s so much good food in New York to be rewarding this place for way below par food.	0
Excellent fresh Mexican food, delicious and inexpensive. This place is well worth the stop. I recommend the ceviche tostada and fish tacos.	1
I went yesterday the first day they were offering lunch. It was a wonderful experience. Great food and atmosphere!<br>I can&#39;t wait to go back.	1
This is our go-to hangout. Great food, lively atmosphere, excellent service. It's extremely kid-friendly but they also have awesome drink specials -- what's not to like? Among my favorites on the menu: the vegan chilaquiles, the pulled pork sandwich and the salmon burger. My husband loves the Tex-Mex pizza and my son loves the pancakes. An excellent, neighborhoody destination any time of day.	1
Food way over priced.  Asked for a lemonade and was given one in  a souvenir glass for $12 without my knowledge. I live in  Vegas- did not need the glass.	0
The food is amazing!! The service was beyond terrible. We went for a friends birthday with a group of 6 people. We got there around 7:30pm When we arrived we ordered our drinks which took longer than 10 min they had a mini show in the meantime and we still hadn&#39;t ordered our food. The dishes were never cleared with the appetizers and the waiter never asked if we wanted refills.<br> When the waiter finally arrive to see if we needed anything everything seemed like a bother to him.constantly looking at us with blank stares. Then when it came time for us to finally order our food. My boyfriend ordered me a churassco with rice and plaintains (he wasn&#39;t going to eat,so it was just for me and he ordered another drink for himself) which seemed to complicated for him since he went on to ask us if we had ever been here before?questioning our orders . Another 30-35 min our food finally came. It&#39;s 9:00pm by this time. And when they waiter came with our order he had came with two ,TWO !!not one churassco steak.When we told the waiter we only ordered one he went on to fight with my boyfriend saying we ordered two (These steaks are $30 each) and the additional drink my boyfriend ordered never got there. <br>when we asked anyone else in the table whether then wanted to share this enormous steak the couple next to us said they would take it since the waiter never asked them for their order! THE WAITER NEVER ASKED THEM FOR THEIR ORDER.Thankfully we didn&#39;t need to pay for two churasscos last night. And lastly we had to separate our own checks because the restaurant doesn&#39;t separate checks, which to me is appalling.we ended up leaving this place at 10:30pm because everything took so much time with our waiter. It just made the evening drag on and we wanted to leave as quickly as possible. <br>This place could have been such a better experience and i have never had such terrible service, I will never go there again. I wish I can tell you the waiters name, but low and behold he never told us this name. And I gave no tip even though 15% gratuity was already included.stay away!!	0
Good place , friendly people , nice portions, went at night time, morning damnedd soo packkk ! An i hate lines , recommend to go night time :)	1
Decent food. Rude ass Philly fans that run the motor club on Sundays. YES, I know this is an Eagles bar, which is why I'm here with my Eagles fan friend to watch a game. I don't need to be reminded 3 times that the games are in the other room (I know I was wearing a bears shirt, but the bears game was over). They pass out these raffle tickets for a drawing that they hold at half time, despite buying two pitchers of beer and four appetizers, my Eagles fan friend did not get offered a ticket to participate. Instead, he got stared down by the dude who runs the shindig, I dunno why. Maybe it's because I'm wearing a bears shirt or my friend's black. Whatever.Truffle fries are good. The "tots" will not satisfy you if you're a tots lover. They lack the fluffiness that tots should have. Stringy chicken parm sliders. Burger is at a decent standard.	0
Too cute! I wasn&#39;t sure what to expect from a hotel restaurant.<br><br>It was my first trip to Vegas when the boyfriend booked us a room at Tuscany Gardens. Gosh, the price was really affordable. We got a spacious room with a comfy bed. There was even a couch/lounge area for our room! All the basic amenities are included. Although the location is a little off the Strip, the walk isn&#39;t too bad to get to the main clubs/whatnot. A cab ride costs less than $10, with tip included.<br><br>You get a coupon booklet when you check-in to the hotel. It includes dinner specials for the restaurant, along with free drinks at the bar inside the hotel. We were able to get beer and some mixed drinks (I can&#39;t specifically recall :X)<br><br>The food is fabulous. I recommend the fettucini alfredo entree. The pasta is creamy and perfectly cooked. For our dinner, the service was wonderful and our waitress was very attentive. She gave us suggestions when we had trouble ordering our meal.<br><br>Since our first trip, we have gone back to Tuscany Gardens. This is definitely my go-to hotel for Vegas.	1
Came here for a birthday date and was incredibly impressed not only by the view, but the wait staff and food. We started off with the ahi tuna appetizer which was so yummy with the sauce and wonton chips. Then my date was stuck whether to order the salmon or gnocchi, when our waitress suggested the seabass. He ordered the sea bass and I the scallops, our food was timed perfectly with our appetizers. My scallops were good, cooked perfectly but nothing spectacular. My date&#39;s sea bass though was simply amazing, so crispy on the outside and moist inside, I kept stealing bites - we savored every morsel! We then ordered the bread pudding once again due to our waitress&#39;s suggestion and it as well was mouthwatering and utterly irresistible! They were sweet and brought it out with a candle on it for my date. The view was stunning, the music was lovely, the food was overall delicious and our waitress knew the best dishes to recommend. Definitely recommend for special evenings or when you&#39;re trying to impress someone ;) Only catch is that their prices are a bit more than average. I will be back for more sea bass and bread pudding!	1
After reading many great reviews about the other westville locations I decided to give this new location a try on a Saturday night at 10 o&#39;clock. It wasn&#39;t too busy so we were seated right away, I was glad the wait wasn&#39;t like the wait at their west village location but I soon found out why. The service was bad and our food was mediocre at best. Our waitress seemed distracted and we ended up getting most of our requests from the bus boys. While our food came out fairly quickly the burger was dry (even cooked at medium rare) the cheese wasn&#39;t melted, the bun was dry, the salad overdressed and soggy, the pickles tasted funky, hmmm. I guess at least it was fairly priced. Now, perhaps I just caught this place on a bad night but I just don&#39;t understand the hype of this place.	0
Effing rip off. $35 for two mimosas and a ham sandwich with sunny side up egg on top (croque madame). Service was okay so $40 total.	0
For such a densely packed area between Crenshaw and Culver City, it&#39;s hard to find these little gems. You&#39;re often stuck going to the safer known places like McDonalds or Starbucks or 7-Eleven. For your lunch breaks, if you need something that&#39;s filling and healthy, don&#39;t look for a Subway - go to Mike&#39;s instead.<br><br>I consider Mike&#39;s Deli the little brother of Subway that could, meets a 7-Eleven. Most of the sandwiches here cost $6.99. Sandwich varieties include turkey, beef, chicken, ham, salami, and others; some are hot, most others are cold. Salads are available, as are sides like hot wings and fries.<br>What makes these sandwiches so good are the portions. Sure the sandwiches are only as big as the bread they put them on, but they are quite generous with the meats. You rarely need to ask for extra meat, as any more than what they normally put on their sandwiches is overkill.<br><br>Now about that 7-Eleven part... They don&#39;t have fountain drinks here. Instead, there are shelves with potato chips, and the left wall has nothing but coolers with drinks in them. This comes with the problem that you cannot ask for iced water here, as they have no means to give you just plain tap water (NO CUPS!).<br><br>Mike&#39;s Deli is an awesome place to go to for lunch. The delicious sandwiches are more than enough to get you through the rest of your day.	1
One of the few sit down restaurants for dinner in St. George. Too bad it just as bad as the rest. We had the &#34;special&#34; pre fix menu and it started off nicely with a yummy chicken soup. The second course however, was a big disappointment: tilapia with a seriously salty olive and tomato sauce sitting next to a pile of yellow tasteless rice straight from a Goya box. They didn&#39;t even try to make it look appealing. And then for the desert course, there was a choice of ice cream or tres leches cake. We decided to go for the ice cream because you can&#39;t go wrong with ice cream right? Wrong. I&#39;m not sure how they managed it, but my chocolate ice cream had freezer burn and the vanilla ice cream was the worst I have ever had. No joke. It didn&#39;t even taste like ice cream...more like frozen low fat milk with sugar and pectin. The waitress forgot to bring a glass of wine but I don&#39;t blame her. I would hate working there too and serving food made by cooks who couldn&#39;t care less.	0
The service it hit or miss, but the staff is nice. Been coming here often and the food is always good. I&#39;m giving them four stars because for a sports bar type, they are a four star. Still looking for a five star. Good cold beer, good family atmosphere, a lot of TV&#39;s and clean bathrooms at least when I have used them.	1
The scallops, the onions, the aioli, oh my... Sooooooooo amazing. The messiest and most epic combination of flavours ever. You owe it to yourself to experience it.	0
Haven&#39;t been here for 10+ years but it was a a huge part of life in LA that I thought I should review. I lived there from about 1989 to &#39;90, yes, practically at Canter&#39;s. It&#39;s in Fairfax, which is sort of a Jewish area in LA. <br><br>Coming from Chicago, I quickly became lonesome for a really great Reuben sandwich. LA is the land of arugula this, and tofu-stuffed that and nuevo &#34;three peas and a smear of pumpkin paste&#34; entrees. That you have to drive to. Screw that, baby wants real food.<br><br>This place is oldskool. When I was there, it&#39;d not been remodeled (though it was well maintained, there is a difference) since maybe 1963, and it was full of old people who seemed like they&#39;d been coming there since then. I used to meet up weekly with friends, from a computer BBS (read: geeeeeks).<br><br>It&#39;s got the usual array of yummy food you&#39;d expect to find in a deli. And the Reuben sandwich . . . ahhhh, there may be a god, &#39;cos they created this. Giant, juicy, mounds of corned beef and tangy kraut. I think that&#39;s the only thing I ever ate there, but I did consume many. I&#39;m not Jewish, as the other reviewer mentioned, I do love Jewish mmmmeat!<br><br>No @#(*^%(*&amp;^ tofu. The rest of LA has that . . . this is an oasis of calm in the sea of pretention that is the City of Angels. <br><br>Note to the LoxOMeter: Your list is not complete without hitting this joint! :-)	1
Excellent. Get the fried chicken dinner, very friendly staff. Will go back and get the fried fish	1
I had been to Crush once before and did not have a great experience (waited over 30 minutes for a table when we had a reservation) but decided to give it a second chance. During my first visit, the restaurant was busy and the wait staff was accommodating, even providing us with a glass of wine since they clearly could not honor our reservation. The second time, My husband and I made an 8:00 reservation for Saturday night. I would think that most restaurants in downtown Annapolis would be busy but this place had a total of 02 people dining. Much different from our first experience. Needless to say, we were hesitant about staying for dinner. We waited at the hostess stand with 2 other couples behind us for about 3-5 minutes (while the hostess cleaned tables). When we did sit down, we waited for at least 8-00 minutes and were never even approached by any of the wait staff! Our waitress/hostess actually waited on the 2 couples that arrived after us and never came over to fill our water glasses. We got up and left, just walked out. Honestly, I've never walked out of a restaurant before, but this place was awful. They were obviously short on staff, but there were many opportunities in which someone could have approached us to let us know they would be around to serving us. We went to dinner at Red Red Wine Bar, a place we frequently visit and one that will continue to receive our business.	0
I found Bloom on accident- being new to the area. I am all for organic diners with vegan menus so we gave it a try. We called in a delivery order, but we literally loved one street over from their delivery radius and they wouldn't deliver. Bummer. So, we came for take out and grabbed our food. The pizza and two wraps came to nearly $40, which is alright for the freshness and quality. Sadly, the food was a tad bit cold as it probably sat a little while while being waited to be picked up. The food was delicious and happy to find a place like this in the area.	1
Range is by far my favorite place to go to in Chicago. I love this joint because it&#39;s exactly what I want in a restaurant; the food is very well put together, being as fresh and as local as it can be, without being too rough on your wallet. One thing that&#39;s been continuously frustrating me about Chicago&#39;s food scene, is that it&#39;s OBVIOUSLY meant for people with lots of money. I make a decent wage working for a well respected bakery here in town, so I am invited to a lot of food events around Chicago. As such, I am very involved in the food scene, which is great! But, more often than not, I am left wondering how or why I just spent a quarter of my paycheck on food I could have prepared a lot better than the place I was eating at. I don&#39;t feel this way about Range one bit! They bring you farm fresh ingredients, and have pairing suggestions for craft brews or wine. I can order a very large portion of pork chop, accompanied by fresh locally grown, and organic vegetables and still have money left over for drinks and desserts. Great food shouldn&#39;t be reserved for people who make serious cash, it should be reserved for people who love to eat amazing food. Period.	1
FRESH EVERYTHING. I had fried chicken and waffles which were amazing. The chicken was incredibly fresh, tender and appropriately fried. Service was helpful and attentive.	0
This big cheese aims to please! <br><br>Here are your fail-safe menu options: Cheese, Wine, Baguette Sandwiches, and Salads. Yes, this must be a culinary mea culpa to TCC, but it&#39;s just that simple. <br><br>Our lunch orders were tasty and fresh. Everything on my prosciutto, tomato, and mozzarella sandwich was high quality right down to the drizzled balsamic. The dishes are generous and your order is up in about 5 minutes. I can see a quick lunch happening here or a late lingering afternoon delight.<br><br>Par for this Course.	1
The service sucks. Probably the utmost rudest staff I have ever encountered. I understand if you're reading this and doubt it because you may think I may be rude myself, but the incident did not happen to me personally but my mother. My mother asked kindly what #5 was on the menu because it was vague with its "special seasoning". The waitress in admist of taking our order looked blatantly annoyed and stopped taking our orders and went to a nearby table and cleaned it. So we were all staring at her going like what's going on... Then my mother, being as nice as she is, just said, "ok, I'll take #5" probably because my mother knew it wasn't worth repeating her question and didn't want to upset her more. The waitress continued to ignore my mother and just pretended we didn't exist.. After awhile, we finally managed to get our order, another guest came in and ordered food. Later on, after waiting for a long time, I noticed that the guest got his food before we did. Normaly, this is fine since some dishes are cooked faster than others, but I noticed he ordered the exact same thing we did, but the waitress preferred to give him the food first. My family was quiet the whole time we were there so I don't know what we did to upset the waitress so badly. The guest however, seemed like a frequent customer, and he spoke korean. Even so, if the waitress favored this guest over us, it's unethical how she behaved to my family even though I swear we did nothing but sit down and asked what #5 was. Possible racism, but I'm obviously not completely sure. After waiting awhile for our food, even though other people got theirs in a minute, I find the dish to be just a bit over the price for what it is. It gets bland, but there's salt and side dish for that. Again, my mother asked for 3 bowls but the waitress obviously ignored her. My mother asked again, and she finally gave them to us. I kid you not the waitress's face was so annoyed and frustrated whenever she approached us. Thus I give this place 2 stars, the additional star because the food was alright given I had a sore throat and the porridge was nice down my throat, but that's about it.Edit: I totally forgot to mention that they (may) reuse their appetizers... it's gross. I remember they dumped some leftovers from someone else's table into the bucket they used to serve from. Changing it back to 1-star even if it's just speculation because it did ruin my appetite.	0
- Convenient location<br>- Not a long wait to be seated<br>- Shrimps fresh - medley sauce is the best !<br>- Price reasonable<br> - Staff friendly and efficient ; There was a Gentleman who seemed to be a supervisor or manager that night over-seeing the restaurant that night <br>- Free WiFi <br>- Bathroom was clean that evening<br>- Parking in rear or street parking	1
I was pretty impressed by this place in Little Tokyo. I had the toro roll, spicy tuna roll, spider roll, and some nigiri (hamachi, sake, unagi). Each piece was bliss in my mouth, particularly the hamachi, unagi, and toro. The spider roll could have been bigger and bolder -- perhaps nothing can compare to the spider roll at Sushi Sam's -- but it was still pretty good.I paid $40 (tip included) for my share of the bill, and I was not only stuffed, but confident that I'd eaten very high-quality fish.	1
Parking was fo' free coz the parking attendant disappeared when we came back ayeeee. Lol I felt bad I wanted to forealz pay the dude oh well lol.I ordered sourdough bread, potatoes (hash browns I think), fluffy eggs that wrapped around my bacon like a nice warm blanket keeping my bacon warm and protected like a newborn baby on a winter night, and some giant pancakes yummmm....The sourdough bread was amaze balls you seriously just can't have one they're like potato chips. Lol this place is cute wish menus weren't on the wall though I feel like I accidentally initiate eye contact with a weird stranger lololol	1
Little Dom's is a totally fun and sweet place. I keep reading all these reviews where people are offended by the service or vibe there. I live in Los Feliz and go to Dom's a couple times a month at least, and sometimes more than once a week. The people that work there are always awesome, they're just not going to kiss your ass like in corporate-y chain restaurants. If you are upset or feel slighted by their attitude, then go find yourself an Olive Garden. I'm sure the service there will be excellent for you. If you ask for things like "dipping sauce" (?!) for your garlic fried potatoes, or you want to change the sauce on a pasta, or change the menu at all for that matter, then you are the one who is insulting and are a pain in the ass and deserve the attitude you're getting from your server or bartender. Los Feliz in general is not too welcoming to these types of people, so go home. The food at Little Dom's is generally great. They, like any other place in that price range, have off nights from time to time. No big deal. That happens everywhere. The menu is not big, and changes with the seasons so asking to change a whole bunch of stuff is bad etiquette in a place like that. If you cannot wrap your brain around this, let me suggest a place for you: Olive Garden. Los Feliz is much more friendly to people who "get it". If you're offended by the pretentiousness of that statement, then you obviously don't. Go Home. Leave my special, pretty little neighborhood and go back to the generic blahness of wherever you came from.	1
GREAT food CRAP service. The Croque Monsieur was reeeeeeally really amazing. Pomme Frites = YUM! Hostess? Not quite as friendly as a rabid monkey. Waitress got our order wrong. Meh. Would not go again even if my sandwich rocked.	1
Meh... wasn&#39;t impressed at all. Soup tasted a bit like chlorine (wash your dishes more thoroughly please), portions were measly, and the noodles REALLY did not live up to their hype--too soft, not elastic enough.	0
At the recommendation of my friend, I tried the Earth Burger special today. Wow. Patty of edamame and mushrooms, truffle oil aoli, caramelized onions, herbed ricotta, tomato, butter lettuce, on a brioche bun. So tender that I had to approach it with knife and fork at first. I think I shall always return to my first love (Port and Stilton burger), but this was amazing. Tell all lacto-veg foodies to come one and all to consume in joy. The cheese tots - meh. Left most of them in the bowl unattended. Cookies and cream ice cream bar from Milk was a nice coda. Orange Crush is always a plus. Yeah!	1
New Italian place in Wynwood. Great atmosphere, service and delicious food, love the feta pita!	1
So Apple Pan round two -- this time, I got the full experience because the place was busy! We got there in the middle of lunch on a weekend. This time we had to stand in line and wait until people got up, unlike the first time when it was virtually empty.<br><br>I had no idea what the protocol was, but from the first visit, I knew there definitely was some protocol going on, so we just followed what everyone else was doing. There were tourists, families, people dining alone...... but when we got seated, I didn&#39;t even need a menu this time. I knew exactly what I was going to order and I was gonna do it fast! I had no clue that the act of waiting behind the diners was &#34;hovering&#34; until one guy stood up and jokingly said to me &#34;stop hovering&#34;.<br><br>The 3 guys sitting next to me were hogging the menus and I thought &#34;okay, I&#39;ll just go with my original choice&#34; although I thought maybe a peek at the menu might make me change my mind, but too late, the guy was already in front of us.<br><br>I got the hickory burger with cheese, fries, iced tea. I loved the hickory burger..... too much lettuce this time (note to self, omit lettuce next time) but I wolfed it down in no time and then even agreed to share apple pie a la mode. <br><br>So our server was even more efficient than the dude from my first visit. I mean seriously, he knew we needed stuff before we even knew it. He came to refill my iced tea before I finished the last sip, and he did this like 3 times. The apple pie was kinda runny and of course the ice cream made it even more liquidy, and before you even realize that the fork wasn&#39;t gonna cut it, he was there with spoons. I mean seriously?!?!?!<br><br>I really need that guy to come home with me! I need that kind of efficiency at home!	1
I have lived in the Gables area for almost ten years and this place is walking distance!<br>I have gone from post college to grown up and still find that taking people here for breakfast is a win win situation. <br><br>The decor is that there is none. <br>The floor is usually dirty.<br>There are no reservations and no hostess. <br><br>The IS always water in your cup, a friendly waitress who remembers your name if you tell her, delicious cuban food, and even better cafe con leche. <br><br>I am such a fan of this restaurant, everyone who has ever stayed with me, visited Miami, or has been within earshot knows that I love it. <br><br>YUM YUM, when my family visits from Orlando, they actually stop there before getting to my house. <br>Sometimes, they even call to see if I want anything...	1
Excellent. I love the hamachi ceviche. Do not miss out on their quesadillas. huge and to die for. Octopus, asada and baja fish tacos are my top three. Their cocktails are out of this world. My fav is the diving bell and the spicy habernero one whose name escapes me. My server Tyler was attentive, knowledgable, funny, and prompt. Cant ask for more. Melissa, the GM is incredible. Last minute reservations and excellent customer service. She runs this place well. Will be back.	1
OMG!!! came here on a recommendation from a friend, and boy do i owe her! This place ROCKS!!! I can never find a true burger place with thick, juicy, and a perfect medium rare until now. We've tried most of the burgers on the menu, but i am now a fan of the truffle burger! although the tater tots are not on the menu, ask for it!!! This is not your tots, they're double the size and accompanied by horseradish cream. just simply delish!!!	1
The Mediterranean Guacamole was outstanding. I'm usually not a big fan of Mexican style food, but their twist on the Chimichanga made it a dining experience rather than a take out item.	1
Good Hibachi joint. Prices were reasonable, drinks were good. Flavoring of the fried rice and some of the grilled dishes could have been a little better.	1
I&#39;m so sad to have to rate Little Dom&#39;s ONE star... especially b/c its close to home, I love Italian, and the ambiance is beautiful... but that is where the good things end.<br><br>I don&#39;t care about the image of a place, whether it has the hippest peeps from the block dining, drinking wine &amp; smoking cigarettes... so that appeal only lasted about 2 minutes for me.<br><br>It all boiled down to the food. I eat out a lot... and when trying a new place, we try to choose one thing thats basic (like a sandwich) and one option thats perhaps a little difficult to nail. The meatball and cheese sandwich was really bad. It was so dry, there was barely any tomato sauce on it and the meatball was even drier. We couldn&#39;t believe that a Subway meatball sub could be better than the $14 one we just bought. When we asked for a side of marinara, we got a side of tomato sauce... like CANNED tomato sauce. There was no question about it... it was straight from a can.<br><br>Also ordered was the squid salad which came with squid and fingerling potatoes. The potatoes were hard and the whole thing had a horrible sauce on it. Eeew. <br><br>I hate wasting $$ and food, so I almost always take home leftovers but we left all the food there. It was disgusting. <br><br>So ... an Italian place that can&#39;t get a meatball sandwich right is not a good thing... I want to say that I&#39;d like recommendations on something else... but I&#39;m pretty certain if you can&#39;t get a sandwich right... I won&#39;t be back.<br><br>But bless your outside tables, wine, and beautiful people Little Dom&#39;s... sadly... thats all u got.	0
Amazing place. Simply fantastic. I have never been disappointed. I also have nothing more to say! Just go...	1
First time. We had heard good things our food was good but our server ruined our meal with her poor service. She never refilled our drinks and forgot my soup	0
Good italian food. Cesar salad was nice. We also had mussels and a great flatbread.<br>Very nice surprise. Not your typical neighborhood franchise. Waiters were very helpful and friendly. Definitely will come back	1
The food is very fresh - you can tell it is made when your order. The snapper with banana slices is one of the best fish dishes I&#39;ve ever had. So fresh it was practically like butter. Patio seating with views of the water and ocean breeze. Just finished a great lunch. Service was great and pleasurable too. Awesome!	1
Great pizza and good selection of local beers. Their happy hour starts at 3:00, and is worth the wait.	0
This is a State Steet type of bar that is not on state. Cheap tap beers, typical bar food. It may be time for an update and some new menu items.....	1
best place to go after going out	1
Had one of those horrible terrible, no good days at work and the bf suggested that we try this place out for &#34;linner&#34;. Talk about comfort food. The melty, garlicky chicken adobo grilled cheese was like a warm hug for my stomach. It had the perfect ratio of soft, buttered bread toasted to perfection, gooey melted cheese and hearty chicken adobo topped off with a melt in your mouth garlic spread that made every bite a small celebration in my mouth. <br>You don&#39;t get yummy food like this often in this acai bowl crazed city. Anytime you want to be just a little bit bad, make your &#34;cheat day&#34; 110 times worth it, come out for some awesome Filipino comfort food twist on your favorite afterschool snack deliciousness.	1
the honey wings are soo good! definitely worth eating on cheat day	1
I came in on a Sunday evening around 4pm. It's tucked away in the middle of the block. The place is Small and cozy, nice decor inside. There was one table leaving as we sat down. Service was a bit slow and lacking. I wanted the seafood linguini from the yelp pictures I saw, they were out. I ordered the sphagetti bolognese (13.00$ not on the menu and the only reason why I came to Dante's and luckily they still had some. The pasta was cooked perfectly. It was lacking a bit of the sauce but still delish. Portions are tiny tiny! The waitress recommended the grilled calamari dish from the small plates which I got. It was totally not what I had expected. It tasted bittersweet and old. We also ordered the spring mix salad with rainbow trout (9$) nothing amazing.. I've had better and am not very impressed with Dante's, although I do like the ambience and setting of the bar, but as far as food goes along there are other really good italian restaurants in SF to try.	0
Went in after 10 on this Tuesday night. Had their regular burger & garlic fries. Great burger & I'm ready to kill vampires now :-) I'm loving that they have Red Breast- I freaking need to cut down on this whiskey. Tons of TV's & a non pretensions crowd/ staff. Really enjoyed watching this beautiful blood moon while having a drink in their patio. Now if they could have reverse happy hour at least once during the week, they'd get 5 stars. Hint, hint :-)	1
Oy... oh fundamental LA... what to say? Sorry guys this is going to be a long one<br><br>I&#39;ve bookmarked fundamental LA for the longest time..probably ever since it opened and for some reason although I was a UCLA undergrad, now work at UCLA, never made the effort to come here.<br><br>When I finally had chance last night, I was ecstatic and so excited for what was to come. Reviews for fundamental are mixed and I can definitely see why...here&#39;s my experience.<br><br>Service:<br>-The service was great. our party of 3 made a reservation for 8:30pm, upon arriving we were seated immediately.<br>-our server was very nice, probably could&#39;ve been a little more suggestive with the selections and offering her suggestions, but she was kind.<br>-our glasses were never empty, she came around and maybe refilled our water every 5mins...it was different<br><br>-Food-<br>the good:<br>-Brussel sprouts:who would&#39;ve known that marinated roasted brussel sprouts would be so damn good? The tom yum marinated was amazing and saturated the entire brussel sprout. That in addition to the slightly charred edges of each pieces from the roasting equated to quite an experience to your taste buds. This, although small in portion, was definitely my favorite dish.<br><br>the okay: <br>-striped bass: The description sound very tasty....the actual end product? Well.. although we were informed that each dish was meant to be shared and that each person should order about 2-3 dishes... DAMN really? That piece of fish was tiny. Although i enjoyed the texture contrast of the super delicate fish and the crispy skin, the price for that item was just a bit hard to swallow for me. I did appreciate the execution and plating of the dish and the kale/white bean sauce surrounding the light bass was very complimentary, but did the dish blow me away? Not so much.<br><br>-infamous chicken torta: Please, tell me again why this dish is so popular? I really didn&#39;t see anything special about it. I mean, yea it was an okay tasting torta, but I definitely could&#39;ve gotten some way better at a mom and pop Mexican joint for half the price. <br><br>-baked cod: the fish was very fresh..the size of the fish was slightly bigger than a post-it yay! (better than the bass). Flavor? very light? memorable? Not at all? I had this last night and I have no idea what it tasted like.. yes it was That forgettable.<br><br>I&#39;m really disappointed to say the least. The portions really isn&#39;t the reason why the experience was disappointing, overall it was simply a lack of flavor. I would&#39;ve been content with the experience if the dishes were memorable, but instead everything was just mediocre and not worth all the hype that it has received. It was good..but definitely not delicious. For what you&#39;re paying (although the quality of the items were great) I did expect something new and more innovative. Maybe I&#39;m just not cool and hip enough for this place.. eh. <br><br>needless to say, I will not return...UNLESS i&#39;m solely ordering a side of the brussel sprouts..that was good.	0
Perfect rooftop cocktail to end any evening, they usually have some sort of live music overlooking the city and the sunset. Drinks are expensive but worth it.	1
I was actually really excited to try this place cause I had heard it was good. <br>What a disappointment. <br><br>The food was greasy, and not good quality... Nothing about my meal was good, and it was extremely overpriced.<br><br>Go to Gigi near by, much better food &amp; quality.	0
I really enjoyed their Salted Chocolate Chess and Coconut Custard pies! Hm... my slice of Chocolate Chess is a lot smaller than the one I had last time... Maybe it was because it was from a new pie?<br><br>Do not think the store is closed if it&#39;s empty inside. If the door opens, just go in and someone will be there shortly. (Or you can call just in case, which I did)<br><br>Take your time looking at the pies and other baked goods. Some of them are under glass/pie displays or on a rack.	1
Who are these people giving this place anything more than 2 stars?!?? This place is disgusting! Ugh! The only edible thing here is the fried bread. The food is terrible, and what is that thing they call hash brown? It&#39;s mushy potato with super fried outer crusts.<br><br>I ordered the French dip, and it was foul. The meat was ROTTEN! It smelled funny, but I gave it the benefit of the doubt and took a bite. Yuck! The waiter got so upset, and he insisted the meat was perfectly fine. Yet, he held his head far away and refused to take a whiff of the rotten meat. Needless to say I hurried home so I can be near a clean bathroom when shit breaks lose. No pun intended.<br><br>Also, I hope all the people waiting in the long line outside know that they&#39;re falling prey to the restaurant&#39;s clever marketing plan. When the business was slow, Riordan split the Original Pantry into two restaurants with a shared kitchen. The line would attract more people to the Pantry, and he can use the extra space next door to open another restaurant. Just some food for thought.	0
We eat at RG several times a year and always enjoy the food. On this night during restaurant week the four of us liked our entrees: pork ravioli, salmon, and bouillabaisse.  The rownut for dessert was decadent with a sweet and salty taste.  The cocktails were well prepared and generous.  The only negative would be the server.  On one hand she was very efficient and the food and drinks arrived promptly.  On the other hand she was very abrupt and just at the edge of rudeness.   If she made just the slightest effort to be less flip and a bit friendlier it would have made for a more enjoyable evening.	0
Heard about Whiz through Beer Belly, which is one of my favorite places, so I decided to try it out.<br><br>Service was great, the cashier was very friendly and offered to answer any questions. Me, being from the Philly area and a cheesesteak connoisseur, needed nothing but some fries and a steak sandwich that I&#39;ve been craving. <br><br>I ordered just a basic cheeseteak with American, no onions and an order of Whiz fries. The steak looked great till I realized that the cheese was on the bottom and wasn&#39;t melted on the steak itself. The bread was perfect, (can&#39;t mess up an Amoroso&#39;s roll) the steak itself had a nice flavor, but was way overcooked. Usually when the cheese is melted on top of the meat, this can be covered up, but that was not the case here. <br><br>The fries on the other hand were great, nice and crisp. The homemade whiz sauce was delicious, but a bit thin. All the sauce was at the bottom of the container and I had to take the fries out and spoon it back on top. <br><br>Overall, the cheesesteak was not impressive, Boo&#39;s, Philly West, and Figueroa Philly are all much better. I mean, NO ONE in Philly doesn&#39;t melt the cheese on top of the steak.<br><br>I&#39;ll be back for the fries though...with the cheese on the side.	0
The restaurant was not busy. The hostess took us in the back. We past plenty of open tables. Our waitress took forever to greet us...we even waited for water. The food was good but lukewarm. We had to wave the waitress down for another cocktail. We were watching the other servers and they seemed to be on the ball. When we needed our waitress, we could see her through the mirrors chatting and laughing with the bartender...just inappropriate. We usually really like this restaurant but it was lacking overall this particular night.	1
I am a devotee of Daniel Boulud. I am a long-time devoted customer to Daniel, Cafe Boulud, and less so, Bistro Moderne and Bar Boulud in NYC. So imagine my excitement at learning that  now that I've moved to Boston last year, there would be a Bar Boulud here! Yes!Well, the Globe in particular, and other reviewers expressed massive disappointment. So, my husband and I waited. And waited. And finally, we decided to go with three other couples for brunch last Monday (President's Day). A day where service would be slow (8+feet of snow!). In fact, service was quite good. The ambience is classic Daniel, lovely, but with an injection of hip vibe.However, how can you mess up Quiche Lorraine? Really? While others had better luck, two of us suffered through a parched mess. So much so that the crust was separated from the &quot;pie&quot; itself. Truly unacceptable.  Was it reheated? Old? Poorly crafted from the get-go? I don't think Daniel is aware that Boston is now the home of such intense professionals as Barbara Lynch! Lydia Shires! Etc. Should we give it another go? Not sure it's worth the bother. Or the price (which we don't mind paying, as long as there is a commensurate experience that goes along with it!!).	1
Horrible place. This used to be a decent place up to about 6 months ago. They changed staff and the new people are completely incompetent. Half the time I would place a phone order, and after 30 minutes they hadn&#39;t even send it to the kitchen. Quality of food is mediocre. Try to avoid!	0
Amata is an excellent choice for semi-formal dining with a range of Italians options. I ate here last week with my family and I was not disappointed! We had four different pastas, from tagliatelle to cavatelli and each was as good as the next. The service was great, all the staff were welcoming and knowledgeable and the food was really good. Loved the food here, specially the seafood salad and calamari in sauce for appetizers. The wine I had was wonderful and desserts were excellent. Overall, we had a great time. Would go back again with my loved ones any time!	1
I love that their menu has both seasonal and anchoring plates. We called in for a dinner reservation, even though Open Table said they had none available. Plus points!Their drinks are phenomenal!!! I can see myself coming back for drinks in the future. Back to focus, we came for dinner. I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass in ham hock and was able to try the flat iron. I recommend the flat iron! It was moist and delicious. The sea bass was fresh and light, but I felt like the fish's great flavors were a little washed out with the ham hock. It was a good plate, regardless. Service was slow. Our waitress had a great personality and her energy was invigorating!Yes, the rooftop view is breath-taking.	1
Fun menu with excellent flavor and friendly wait staff! Highly recommended!	1
Very tasty addition to the area.<br>Been here twice, ordered the brisket platter, excellent.<br>We ordered to go and went next door for a drink, our food was delivered at the bar and we enjoyed it with a drink, perfect no fuss about eating food from another business at the bar and it was delicious with an IPA.	1
The food = FANTASTIC<br><br>My boyfriend and I got the Groupon which included 1 appetizer, 2 soups, 2 salads, 2 entrees, 2 deserts and a bottle of wine - it was fantastic!<br><br>We stared off with these chicken strips that had a nice handful of fries underneath and a tasty sweet and sour-like sauce on the side. The. We went on to the soup of the day which was a mushroom soup (it was declines and so velvety). The salads, were standard, a Caesar salad and some fruit style type of salad which I DID NOT enjoy ..<br><br>For wine, they allot you $45 and can choose any bottle of wine, if you go over then you just pay the difference.<br><br>For entrees, my boyfriend got the Piano Lomo Saltado that came with strips of beef, fries and white rice = so juicy and stirring it all together pays out for heaven. I got this Mahi Mahi dish that came with mussels on top of mashed potatoes and veggies on the side.. Those mussels were literally the BEST TASTING MUSSELS I&#39;ve ever had. Wow.<br><br>For dessert we didn&#39;t get to choose but they brought us out this caramelo chocolate dish and it reminded me of ice cream sandwiches.. And honestly, who doesn&#39;t like those :)<br><br>I do believe that having an extra helper on the floor would help the flow of the restaurant better. We didn&#39;t get our bottle of wine until our third course just cuz thy were so busy and only had two people taking orders for the whole place. Parking is also a bit of a situation but other than that the food is delicious and I highly recommend it for a date night	1
Okay, so it used to be a fast food restaurant, and it still has a drive thru. Actually kind of nice if you order takeout you don&#39;t even have to get out of your car. But we were eating in tonight. Decor is minimal but clean. Ordered pad kee mao and spicy basil with chicken. Both at a heat level 2. I like spicy but since we haven&#39;t been here before we decided to play it safe. So glad we did. Most places this heat level would be a 4. Any spicier and it would have been too hot. But both dishes were delicious. Fresh veggies, white meat chicken and freshly cooked with the veggies still crisp tender. Very good. Service was very good but we were the only ones dining in so I wouldn&#39;t expect less. Our water glasses stayed full. We will definitely be back.	1
horrible, snotty service. Overpriced Mexican at its worst.	0
My husband and I dined with friends on Valentine&#39;s night here. What an evening to remember! We visit The Kitchen in Boulder often, but this was our first time at the Chicago location. <br><br>As we were lead to our table, the chic interior set the tone for the experience we were about to have. Beautiful views of the city and river brought the outdoors in, and complimented the on point decor inside. <br><br>We were greeted with Champagne to begin the evening. It was the best I have ever experienced. The sommelier was generous with his time in explaining the background of what we were drinking. We chose to have our dinners accompanied with the wine pairings. Evening on a busy night like Valentine&#39;s, each glass was served with expert knowledge.<br><br>My husband and I are vegetarians. The Kitchen always treats our dietary restrictions with great ease. We had the Wild Mushroom &amp; French Black Truffle Tagliatelle. WOOOOOOOW! It was divine! As was our dessert. <br><br>The thing that makes The Kitchen so special is the superb service. No detail left unnoticed. Its the little things like folding my napkin when I excused myself from the table, coursing each plate perfectly and everyone smiles! <br><br>Thank you Kitchen for making our special evening all the more memorable. We cannot wait to join you again!	1
We love coming here for their Baked Pork Chop and Spicy Salt. We also usually get one of the fried rice dishes with our meal. The only knock on the place is the location. Never had a bad experience and we always look forward to coming here to eat.	1
Lived in a building right next door, so formerly frequented this establishment... Saturday we moved out of the neighborhood, so went for a goodbye brunch. <br><br>The table across from us complained about plastic in their veggie burger - gross. But not gross enough for us to leave. I ordered the caesar salad and my boyfriend got the kale caesar. Everything was fine until... I found a BIRD FEATHER in my salad. Like, mixed in, with dressing on it. Gross gross gross. <br><br>Our server was nowhere to be found, so we told the hostess, who took the feather inside. When the sever finally came out, he was like, &#34;so I heard about the feather - can i get you a cookie or something?&#34; - Are you serious? No thank you. <br><br>It seemed like the server thought the whole situation was hilarious, and I should feel lucky that they removed the salad from my bill. Gee thanks. <br><br>This place is disgusting, will never come back.	0
Omg..the food was soooo good. I ordered online on New year&#39;s day. My husband went to pick up the food and everything was ready for pick up minus the dessert I ordered. They ran out of tres leches so for the inconvenience they gave me a free dessert..very thoughtful. The food was cooked to perfection..in all honesty..way better than Sergios around the corner. So glad they opened down the street..we will be ordering from them again soon!!!	1
We went to Bluegrass after moving in a couple blocks away. Great place. Neighborhood feel, friendly servers, and a great menu. Definitely worth checking out. No complaints from me or my fiance. We'll definitely be back.	0
Never got to eat here because the flakey hostess was going to sit my 3 person party at a very small 2 seater table that was already connected to another couple crouching to eat their food. She was like &#34; it really is meant for 3 people..&#34; really? Really? If there isn&#39;t room for 3 dinner plates it&#39;s not a 3 seater. Whatever, turned around and walked to another restaurant.	0
Best BANANA CREAM PIE ever!!!	1
Came here a few weeks ago and enjoyed a delightful dinner. We ordered a plain cheese pizza, which to me is the test if a pizza joint is either good or bad. If you can&#39;t make a good cheese pizza, then I don&#39;t want to try anything else.<br><br>Although it wasn&#39;t the BEST pizza I&#39;ve ever had it was quite yummy. Perhaps if the crust wasn&#39;t infused with herbs I would&#39;ve liked it more. I believe it had specks of oregano which I&#39;m not that crazy about. Sans the oregano the pizza would&#39;ve been close to perfect.<br><br>The staff was nice and the atmosphere was very chill. The entire restaurant is covered in unique art work and quotes painted by the employees and owners I assume. The Misfit poster sealed the deal for me.<br><br>I will definitely come back and try their other items!	1
Cute atmosphere, plenty of outlets, good wifi, friendly staff, awesome coffee. Nothing bad to write!	1
Went here with a large group over the past weekend. The owner of the restaurant was very nice and very helpful with our group!<br><br>We ordered everything on the menu, but some things that stood out to me..<br><br>Bone Marrow was delicious! It reminded me of Purple Pigs.<br>The Mussels were also very good!<br>The homemade beef jerky was awesome, and I finally got to taste non-gas station beef jerky!<br><br>Their desserts were also amazing! We ordered all 3 on the menu, and they were all sooooo good! So make sure you save room for desserts! They had some banana bread pudding dessert that they are serving during Restaurant week that you HAVE to get!	1
Five stars for the ambiance & deserts (which are made by a local woman!). Very comfortable atmosphere: cozy, welcoming, friendly. If you are looking for to get away from the party crowds, and have a drink in a dimly lit, interestingly decorated bar with good service- this is the spot.	0
Freshest sashimi artfully presented is near 5*(but the smallest micro cuts) when served by the talented and caring Eric, BUT SADLY the wait for food service here is ridiculously long as the charming Eric tries to personally accommodate everyone, and I mean everyone (Mission Impossible). The waitresses are sweet though mediocre &amp; persistently to pushy with refills (I still have a half of beer left and she wants me to order another??)... if your not careful you will have easily polished off 3 beers before you even get your first order. Typically we wait at least 30 minutes after sit down until first food order arrivals... tastes great, but not fun and no way worth the long waits for food (usually 2 and half hours for a few orders and a lot of beer and saki) and then there&#39;s the big, almost Tokyo priced, ticket at the end. We have visited this Yummy Grill only 10 times hoping service would improve, but unfortunately not to be. I trust your experience here will be perfect if it&#39;s ONLY Eric and you )with no other patrons to share him with), otherwise this long time native L.A. sushi addict highly recommends you journey to the fabulous Sen Sushi for the complete package of joy and sushi happiness.	0
Brand new location in Brickell! They serve both Vietnamese and Chinese cuisine. YESSSS!!!!<br><br>Very reasonably priced and they have lunch specials. I tried the Americanized Chinese dish &#34;shrimp egg foo young&#34;. It was excellent. I brought it home and devoured it. I definitely am interested to see how their Vietnamese fare matches up to other Vietnamese restaurants I&#39;ve tried. <br><br>The location is small and cute and very clean. They opened a week ago so give them a try!	1
I have been to the vineyard many times.  The food, service and wines are outstanding!	0
The service was excellent, the food was 4 star good, and the beer list is eclectic and fun.	1
I enjoy coming here even though it is a little out of the way. I can usually find parking in the residential area, about a block away. I give it four stars because I have not tried most of the foods or any of the desserts here. However, I also give Toast four stars because I find their wraps and mushroom barley soup rather tasty. Their side fruits are better than your average fruit bowl as well. They add berries and a few other fruits to their melons. I'm a sucker for blackberries. I like to bring friends here when they want to try something slightly upscale but not way out of their price range.	1
I still cannot believe I paid $42 before tip for the MOST TINY piece of &#34;roll&#39; ever!! I literally laughed when they handed me my order of the Noah&#39;s Ark (sample of 2 half rolls of each). First of all, my issue here with Luke&#39;s does not simply rely on the hidden location and service which ill get into soon but the fact that they have the audacity to have the word ROLLS on their menu just baffles me! With the cost you are charging, you can at least save us the agony of serving cheap hot dog buns and ripping them in half with the nerve to call them &#39;half rolls&#39; then charging so much for them. I get that the cost of seafood can be high but the lobster which is the most important part was not even that great. Ive had better. The seasoning was good which is what saved me from going back to the counter and demanding a refund lol.....<br><br>Either way its safe to say I wont be returning and its a shame since I spend so much time over in bk bridge park. But the main reason is because there is a young guy there with glasses who had the nerve to shoo me away while he was texting on his phone one time because I knocked on the window to ask the operating hours, which apparently I had missed that day. Im like dude its fine if your closed I dont bite, I just want to know what your hours are... Rude! (Its 11a-4p btw) ...Then he opens the door and claims he didnt hear me because hes sick- like that makes any sense.<br><br>Anyway, NOT WORTH YOUR TIME OR MONEY. Maybe in the summer if they ever decide to change their fake hot dog buns into real rolls and serve even a slightly larger portion Ill reconsider.	0
Vegetarian sandwich is really good!! No cheese and mayo to make it vegan :) guys here are so nice. I usually have to ask for water but they offered us water. Will definitely be back!!	1
One my favorite breakfast places but also serve lunch and dinner. Just enjoyed the Brisket Red Potato hash w/ Avocado poached egg. Great flavor and protein to start your day!	1
Totally love LA Cafe' they have the best French Fries in DTLA.It can get a little busy there on weekends around 2am so a good tip is to call your order in for pickup.	1
I just went on eat 24 to try to order pizza from these &#34;highway robbers&#34; and the delivery charge alone was 6 dollars!!!!! Wtf!!!!!! The normal fee anywhere is from $1.50 to $3 dollars!!!!! Thats an incredible rip off!!!! Thats double than usual!!!!!! I will never order delivery from these thieves!!!!!!	0
This is the first and the last time I will be going here! I ordered a burger with my boyfriend and the first bite was into literally raw meat. The outside of the burger was brown but the inside was lukewarm and (not kidding) PINK! My boyfriend&#39;s burger was the same but he ate his anyway...I was disgusted and asked them to re-cook mine. Also, the Arnold Palmer drink was more like lemon and water; they make enough money off of this Shake Shack gimmick you&#39;d think they can afford to add some iced tea and sugar. Personally I like &#34;Five Guy&#39;s&#34; burgers much better, this was E coli on a bun with some dirty lemon water to wash it down. .	0
The Six is a great place to drunk brunch. $10 bottomless mimosas = a steal! I've been here a few times (once for dinner and once for brunch). Overall, very cute place. Service is good. Prices are reasonable for what it is. My previous trip I had a Six Burger and this time around I had the Egg Sandwich. Both were good if very plain. My friend had the Italian egg something or other and it was delicious (though a bit salty from all that pancetta). My only beef is that both times I felt like I could probably achieve the same results at home. Would really like to see them take there food up a gourmet notch or two. They definitely have potential.	1
2 stars because Food was just okay. The famous Chicken pot pie was bland. The desserts were very good..pecan pie and carrot cake were amazing. Staff was extremely pleasant. Atmosphere is warm and cozy and roomy.	0
Warm, dark, & cozy - my kind of place. The place already had a wait at 6:30pm on a Friday. We waited about 15 minutes for a spot which was thankfully not right by the door (being in the basement, cold air sinks down the stairs, despite the two doors between the restaurant and outside).	0
Alas, I have but one regret in going here: I didn&#39;t get the pig&#39;s head. So what a great reason to go back again. Actually, I already have plenty of reasons to go back again. Let&#39;s start with the black pepper rigatoni with the boar ragu. Or the black ink pasta. Or their focaccia. Or the... OK, you get the point.<br><br>Want a meal for yourself? You can go that route. Want to share plates? You can go that direction, too. We did the latter, and every dish was a hit. So was the wine, and Charlatan has a solid list of vino. I was jealous of the couple that got the pig head two tables down because it looked and smelled fantastic. Ah well, if at first you don&#39;t eat pig head, try to go back again :)	1
I love these smaller NY and SF-style restaurants that keep popping up. The Six has solid food and a quaint, rustic atmosphere. TVs hang in the corners, which is a little odd since it's more a restaurant than a bar, but they were showing old movies, which was kind of cool. I made reservations for 4 people on a Saturday night, but actually didn't need to. Food-wise the only thing I didn't like was the cassoulet. I LOVE cassoulet so I'm on the pickier side, but this was basically a skillet of beans. Skip it. The mussels, however, were delightful as was the parmesan cheese covered corn on the cob. The server even took it back to have it cut into 4 pieces. The tomato and burrata salad was fresh and light and creamy- definitely a highlight. And it was a nice-sized portion as well! I'd like to go back and try the burger, as well as a few other things on the menu next time.	1
Excellent brunch, with a drink option. Try the bloody mary! Lots of beer options, including those from next door at the Essen Haus.	0
Finally got to Umami Burger after countless people telling me to go. Well, I did it...and I was pleased. Love it when a restaurant automatically cooks their burgers medium rare. And I appreciate their attitude about the quality of their food. Our server was great. Gave us the whole Umami introduction and even went to find out the consensus on the pronunciation of my new favorite beer: Xingu. I was pleased they carried it and also my current favorite cider, Julian. We got the Cali Burger. I like to start out with a relatively simple version as a basic test. Having passed that easily, I will move on to their Umami Burger with caramelized onions and shiitake mushrooms next time. And I will NOT be sharing again. These burgers are on the small side and I want ever bite I can get.	1
Excellent food, great atmosphere and view. The service was quick and professional, nothing to complain about there. We had the baked brie appetizer, I had the pot-au-feu short ribs and my fiance the chicken supreme, and shared the orange cardamom creme brulee. All were excellent, although there was maybe a slightly heavy hand with the cardamom (I like the flavor, but it drowned out the orange and vanilla a bit). The only misstep was syncing up the drink and food service; I was halfway through my entree before I was offered a new drink (after finishing my cocktail), and the after-dinner drink arrived long after dessert. Also, the spicy jalepeno cocktail is REALLY spicy. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but I was expecting a little hum of jalepeno and got a blast of heat (and I'm generally a fan of spicy food). Regardless, very well done overall and we'd definitely go back.Regarding the reviews about people having bad service with groups, this is not a big space, there are very few big tables, I'm honestly surprised they even allow reservations for more than 6 or so. I would not recommend this as a place for large groups, but for an intimate, 2 or 4 person meal, it's excellent.	1
Went here to get dessert after dinner with a few friends. Ordered a brownie and it had no listing about having nuts in the brownie after eating it and having an allergic reaction without realizing... I said to the waiter who said &#34;well all brownies have nuts in them&#34; walked away. Then when approaching the manager about this he said it was my fault for not asking about the nuts and said they have nuts in all the desserts. Also my friends had apple pie and it was dreadful. The food really blew. Don&#39;t go here ever. Terrible management.	0
haven't eaten yet, but.... I think this is gonna be good....this is a long overdue update....the place is great. no bells & whistles.they do have a fairly creative lot of pizza though. it's all around damn good pizza. 'nough said.	1
Wow. Two previous restaurants have failed in this spot - Third time is most definitely the charm. <br><br>Came here for a birthday dinner and it was perfect in every way - Great ambiance and service adding to the whole experience, but it was the phenomenal flavors that gets Cow &amp; Clover 5 stars. The octopus starter was scrumptious. Wanted to lick the plate. The endive and farro salad was delicious. The burger - mouth-watering. The special of the day - a boneless pork shoulder - totally epic. All paired with (several bottles) of totally reasonably priced ($40) really, really good wine. <br><br>Can&#39;t wait to be back.	1
Had been wanting to try this place for a while. Finally made it in. Observed everyone else's food which looked amazing. Their menu was plentiful. I ordered a grilled a grilled cheese and my bf ordered a breakfast sandwich. Both were awful. There was nothing grilled about my cheese, it was cold and unmelted and there wasn't a server in sight to request another. The coffee was good. My advice save your money go somewhere else.	0
I have had every kale salad in Williamsburg, and this is the best. The only negatives are that it&#39;s not open on Sundays, and the rest of the menu is slightly inconsistent - sometimes the sandwiches are fantastic, and sometimes they just taste off.	1
I used to like the Grove but it has become increasing disappointing over the years. It's just OK now. The food always leaves something to be desired. To top it off, last time I was in there they passed by my table and asked if I wanted a refill of tea. I say sure, and they drop it off with a check for $2. Not cool.	0
We eat out often and Crave didn't meet our expectations. While the service was outstanding, the food/drinks are just so-so. With many restaurant choices in around the DT Summerlin area, there are no plans to visit Crave anytime soon.	0
Tried it all. Haven't been disappointed yet. Asada fries are delicious!	1
I actually came here awhile back soon after the place had first opened after discovering it on Yelp. I thought cheese, sandwiches, and salads, how could I not fall in love. <br><br>I am not going to lie when you walk in everything is positively overwhelming. It&#39;s a bistro and a cheese store mixed with books and little nick knacks. <br><br>After getting some help from the staff, we ordered the Spanish Field Greens along with the Italian Caprese at the counter and eagerly waited for its arrival. <br><br>And waited. Yea still waiting. Granted the place was busy, there system for delivering the food to customers is a disaster. There is a small window on the right where they call your name from to your food, but this window is surrounded by cheese and tables so you can&#39;t stand there because you will be in the way. So then after you finish admiring all the cheese and have three rounds of the samples you are left awkwardly waiting for your food, but some do people go ahead and sit down. If nobody responds to the name called the food runner has the task of finding which table or person standing ordered the ordered food by their last name. Yea as I said, not a good process. So after 25 minutes of my friend and I taking turns on awkwardly waiting, the food was ready. <br><br>The reason why I ordered the Spanish Field Greens was because it had manchego on it, but it was sliced so thin that I couldn&#39;t even taste it. The dressing was bland and tasteless and I really did feel like a rabbit solely eating lettuce. I had ordered the sandwich to be pressed and warm upon recommendation by the staff member, and it came out cold and blah. The mozzarella was fresh, but the basil wasn&#39;t and the balsamic left the sandwich a bit soggy. <br><br>Overall I had a pretty awful experience there and the place has gotten so many good reviews that I want to go again to hopefully alter my views, but for now the damage has been done.	0
First thing's first, I dislike paying for expensive Asian food, especially since I know I can probably get something tastier for cheaper down the street. That being said, Nan King is alright but I feel that it's a bit pricey for what you get. The only time I eat here is when my non-Asian friends want Chinese food that's not too scary. 'Nuff said.	0
Delicious paninis and salads. The flavors are vibrant and you feel like you&#39;re in Italy!	1
Amazing happy hour!!!	1

Stopped by on a Tuesday evening and this place was empty. Hill and Dale has only been opned for 2 months.<br>A lot of seats, my friends and I sat by the door where the was a couch<br><br>We ordered:<br><br>Sliders (with pork belly) - I liked the beef sliders with pork belly much more than just the regular beef sliders<br><br>Double fried fries - So addicting, we ordered 4 of these<br><br>Each of the oysters - I&#39;m not an oyster fan, but my friends scarfed down 4 plates of oysters<br><br>Second time around I stopped by just for the hazelnut macaron ice cream with blueberry peach compote and van leeuwen ice cream, and unfortunately I was a little disappointed as this was just okay!	1
Looovvee this place! Everything are just excellent! From the service, food, ambiance. I really enjoy coming here, always hit the spot. Except for the drive. I really hope they open one around Pasadena area, I'm sure that'll be a big hit!	1
meh, i've had better. certainly overpriced, have to say that the salsa may be good but it's not making $15 burrito and drink lunch worth it. burritos shouldn't try to claim gourmet. keep it fresh, simple and reasonably priced Thanks!	0
The one drink I got here was mostly taken up by a giant ice cube so it didn&#39;t get me drunk. seemed pretty cool, maybe too cool for me and my okcupid first date. Enjoy!	1
So I&#39;m on here for business. I&#39;m from L.A. and I really haven&#39;t had cuban food before but SWEET BABY JE-SUS this food was off the chain! I mean from the bread to the mojito to the chicken...YES, YES, YES! <br><br>I had the Chicken Fricassee (fricase de pollo) with sweet potatoes, black beans and rice, and fried plantains. Mmm. It&#39;s been a loooong time since I had some fried plantains I tell you! The chicken was so moist and tender, it just came off the BONE. MMM! And the potatoes were tender. The plantains were fried PERFECTLY. The black beans and rice were a bit dry but they usually are. My mojito was the BEST mojito I&#39;ve ever had. I don&#39;t know what rum my waiter put in it but I only drank 1/4 of it and I was buzzin&#39; HARD! LOL. Luckily my hotel is 2 lights away! lol! The bread was like a garlic, olive oil, lime concoction maybe...on fresh, soft, sourdough bread.<br><br>Mmmm perfecto!<br><br>I haven&#39;t had a meal like that in I dunno HOW LONG.<br><br>I&#39;m a picky eater and very critical but this place...5 stars hands down! You HAVE TO go there! <br><br>;)<br><br>Es excellente!	1
Very good place to eat in LA. It&#39;s fame has true reason.<br>I came here with some friend&#39;s after attending the annual Johnny Ramone tribute at Hollywood Forever and had never been here before. Well, the spots it had on the Travel Channel were very correct when they praised it. I had their famous pastrami/corned beef and it was unbelievably good. Plain and simple.<br><br>Even the pickles you get on the side somehow stand out amongst the world of relatively normal pickled cucumber spears. Kosher truly has a new place in my heart(No, that was not a clogged artery joke, but I digress). I ended my visit by stopping at their wall of baked goods, purchasing a slice of their cheesecake while I was at it to take home with me. The next day when I had it, I found Nirvana. And it wasn&#39;t the Washington based grungy kind either, but the rich and creamy kind dipped in udder glory.<br><br>Ok, now to be human for a change. The only things to not enjoy about the place is:<br><br>1.) The noise level. It&#39;s a bit noisy, but maybe only if you were me and were sitting next to an unknown music producer who had a flock of desperate woman with him, laughing at every little joke he would make, regardless of it truly being funny or even without a single hint of successful timing to them as if they were Ray Liotta in &#34;Goodfellas&#34; kissing Joe Pesci&#39;s ass via his trademark hyena cackle.<br><br>2.) The price. But you gotta spend money to get what&#39;s worth the money, so deal with it and you&#39;ll be in jewish heaven. If that&#39;s a thing...	1
Awesome mussels! Good food! Should try this place out.	1
Get ready to wait in line for about an hour for ridiculous food you can probably make at home. These long wait times happen especially on weekends, weeknights, and sometimes even lunch.<br><br>Highly priced food, might I add. I used to not mind going when they still had the Chicken Vino Bianco, which was chicken in white wine sauce with onions, garlic and oil over a bed of pasta. Now that they removed that item, I don&#39;t go very often. One of the last times I went I found a piece of soft plastic wrapping surrounding my chicken on the plate of food. It was about 3-4 inches long and disgusting. The waiter discounted my food and apologized, so thats good, I guess. The other day I went for lunch and decided to try the pizza. What a mess. It was mostly crust, with the toppings barely there. Some of it was burned black. Just a disaster.<br><br>If there&#39;s two things keeping me from giving it zero stars, its the bread and salad, and the service. Next time I might just eat some bread, salad and soup. That seems to be the way to go.	0
It's been a few years since we've been back in the area.  I was very happy to see that Bistro Blanc is still an excellent restaurant with great service.  The five of us really enjoyed our meals and the recommended wine.	0
Let me break the scene down for you: unemployed girls on their phones browsing Instagram, gallons of perfume wearing Persians looking for "that hot chick over there, bro" and food that will make you say "you know, that Big Mac sounds really good right now." Garbage scene of clowns with food to match. Went here once when it opened, ran out an hour later and never came back, bro.	0
Came here to kill some time during our one hour wait at Sushi Hama. But it was so lovely that after dinner, we came back for more drinks! Make sure you sit outside when you come at night, because they have really pretty lights and I think they play movies sometimes. All day happy hour on Sunday! The chardonnay house wine was no bueno, tasted very watered down. But def. get the beer! Don't recall which beers we ordered but all three were very good!	1
Worst service ever defines what I think about this place. I can&#39;t even write about the pizza since the service really killed it for me... And I only called to ask for a delivery... The person was so rude I thought about calling and canceling my order. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever recommend this place...	0
For the past decade I have found the food at Gertrudes to be consistently bad-to-mediocre, no matter who the head chef is. I am always amazed that the vegetables look and taste like they've simply been run under hot water and that no one thinks to add some salt or pepper or (gasp) a delicious sauce to make them even slightly above average. To put it bluntly, the food is bland...as though the restaurant caters slowly to the museum's elderly patrons. I go to Gertrude's a couple of times a year during the spring and summer for one reason only: ambience. The restaurant itself is warm, bright and lovely, with live jazz during brunch, and the outdoor seating by the fountain is unbeatable. Lastly, there is nothing quite like strolling around the museum's sculpture garden on a beautiful summer's day after a filling (if not fulfilling) meal. If your priority is exceptional food, go someplace else, but if you simply want to be in lovely surroundings, are entertaining elderly people with spice or dietary restrictions, or want to impress non-foodie visitors or business partners with one of the loveliest places to eat in Baltimore, go to Gertrudes.	0
Toulouse petite was amazing. The Fried oyster po boy was a delight and the crawfish beignets were to die for. This is a definite must try restaurant	1
I really wanted to like this place. It had all the ingredients of a place I would love to come often. My husband and I ordered the Pork Belly Steamed Buns for appetizer, and then ordered a ramen bowl each. The steamed buns were good, but the ramen were so disappointing. I ordered the Spicy Miso Ramen, and it had so much ginger in it that all I could taste in the broth was ginger. I like ginger, but it&#39;s supposed to be added &#34;gingerly&#34; to enhance the flavors of other ingredients in the food, not overpower them all. The price was also high for what was given. I wouldn&#39;t have minded paying $9-12 for tiny tiny steamed buns and $12-16 for a bowl of ramen, because this place is so convenient for us. If only it had better food! I&#39;m surprised that other people like this place so much. Maybe I should give them one more chance...	0
Really good pizza and cool decor . I had the Hawaiian pizza and it was one of the best I&#39;ve had. My boyfriend had the slaughterhouse pizza and he couldn&#39;t stop taking about how amazing it was. Will definitely be back!!	1
I have been to Range twice now. First for the gluten free pancake and today for the cilantro potatoes ( also gf...like eggs Benedict with potatoes in place of the English muffin--genius!). I love how charming and beautiful the atmosphere is here. You can relax and stay a while....seems like that&#39;s what they invite you to do with their cozy chair areas. Service is also great. Glad this gem is in my neighborhood!	1
Service was wonderful and the happy hour menu is well worth it - plus a diverse selection of beers on tap. I recommend it!	1
Unmemorable. Salty broth. Poser when compared to Santouka. Can&#39;t touch that.<br><br>Only good thing is the soft boiled egg. Carry on folks.	0
Totally cool place tucked away in the downtown arts district. It's a great place to go that's not your typical Hollywood/Downtown LA/Beverly Hills experience. Love that it's so far separated from all that nonsense.Planchette de Charcuterie - got the petit size and it was the perfect portions. All the pates were delish. There wasn't a single one I didn't enjoy or felt was too gamey.Bouillabaisse - got the entree size and it was very rich and cozy. Perfect for a cold, windy LA evening. The broth was a little spicy, which I'm not too big of a fan of. The seafood is very fresh. Mussels were sweet and refreshing. The prawns are huge! Make sure to drench the head in the broth and drink all the juices.Sauteed Brussel Sprouts - not normally a fan of brussel sprouts, but they sauteed theirs nicely with bacon, shallots, and butter. It's a little heavy but still delicious if you control yourself.Overall, a fantastic place. I would definitely come again to try more items on their menu. This is also a great place to take a date because of the intimate setting, yet it's not too pretentious but very classy.	1
Tourist trap. Nothing special. Seems like too much effort for below average diner food. It feels more like a feeding troth than a place and start your day. Almost any diner on the east coast and definitely Norm's puts this place to shame.Inexpensive, low quality ingredients make for low quality food. If you are on a tight budget, and need the most calories for your dollar I'd go. If you want good food go to Norm's or Bottega Louis.	0
The manager was especially thoughtful and made a point to read my note in the reservation that it was our belated Valentine's Day and we had enjoyed Roy's on several occasions while in Hawaii. They were so kind as to leave a card and some ribbons on our table and offered us their delicious poke appetizer. Our server was also fantastic. It was a great night out, and we need it since we have a 00 month old!	0
Not a great experience. Meal was very mediocre for the price. Not high quality like other steak houses in Vegas. Decor is nice and works pleasant. Mistake was made on our bill. We were not given the discount for our Total Rewards card.  Even after it was corrected, still not right. Shady to me. Better steak houses around there.	0
I had a great maiden voyage with Canter&#39;s. I went to Langer&#39;s a couple years ago when I heard about the great Jewish deli tradition in LA and was pleased, so I decided to make it a point to try the equally important historical delis in the area.<br><br>The decor and vibe is as cool as it gets. Old school NY deli vibe, but with a diner flare that only the west coast can provide (since we have more physical space). It&#39;s important to note that this old school vibe is not tacky, nor is it like walking into a dusty mausoleum. The place is not old, rather, it is classic, meaning they have faithfully preserved the fundamental character of the place, while still maintaining a modern restaurant.<br><br>Food: The pickles are spot on. Crisp with just the right amount of spice. I had the Brooklyn ave. w/ corned beef and potato salad, while my guest had a pastrami Reuben w/ fries. My sandwich hit all the right notes---corned beef, slaw, Russian dressing, Jewish rye. I had a couple bites of the Reuben and was equally as pleased. The potato salad has an interesting sweet side to it that contrasts really well with the smoke of the meat and bite of the dressing and pickles. <br><br>The only thing I am sad about, is not being able to take advantage of the bakery. There are some amazing looking things in that cabinet.	1
Perch you are an awesome venue a little bit hard to find but if you get confused from taking the elevators just follow the little bird and it will take you up to Perch. The amazing views of the Downtown city is amazing. I would say it is really worth it. <br><br>When I went here it was at night around 8:00 P.M, I found street parking and walked to the building on Hill Street. It doesn&#39;t look like much but once you get on top it looks a whole lot cooler. <br><br>For dinner I try to have light dinners if I go out and eat at a nice place and I wanted to get a salad. They didn&#39;t have that many options but each salad sounded soo amazing that it was really hard to choose which one I really really wanted to grub on. <br><br>I ordered the Baby mixed green salad which was $11.00. The salad price wasn&#39;t at all bad the the portion was just right for me. I can see it being a little bit small for others so be careful if you are starving then I would not recommend just eating a salad. The baby mixed green salad came with pears, candied walnuts, red onions, maytag blue and balsamic vinaigrette. If you don&#39;t really like a lot of dressing on your salads I would let your server know to put it on the side for an even more healthier option. <br><br>The service was very quick once we ordered our food didn&#39;t take that long to get onto our table. I enjoyed the salad I had and my friend enjoyed the chicken. We both ate our plates clean and enjoyed the nice city lights. <br><br>Highly recommend getting a reservation and also taking your girl out for a nice dinner :)	1
Great food, and a great restaurant experience in general. They just don't make places like this anymore...I had a hickory burger and my friend had a steakburger, both with fries, and both were delicious, if a little messy. Then again, I don't go to a burger joint for impeccable presentation. Loved the ambiance, it's like you can feel the history of the place just sitting at the counter. Will definitely be back to try the pie!	1
I want to call this a hole in the wall, but inside this bar seems huge. There's an outdoor patio area with stringed lights, and an indoor area with SNES games and Jean-Claude Van Damme movies on projector screens. They have a huge list of draught beers, which made my beer-loving self happy. Then disappointed that I drank so many dumb PBRs at Dodger Stadium so I couldn't partake at Far Bar.But I did get a Far Bar burger! The gouda on the burger totally makes it. Normal, thin french fries on the side. My friend and I totally coveted the karaage chicken once the smell hit our noses, so that might be on order next time.The atmosphere is really nice here. It seems super laid back, but full of beautiful people. I felt kind of slobby in my post-baseball game attire, so you might want to switch out the sneakers for extra-clean sneakers when you visit.	1
Husband had the etouffe and liked it the fried gator was good. Nice snack but pricey.	1
The best spot for a weekend brunch I like everything on the menu, super fresh and delicious. Great customer service	1
Grood (Great/Good) Chowder and Perfect on a cold wet day!	0
Probably one of my favorite spots in DTLA, and a staple for taking friends from out of town. Classy but relaxed rooftop lounge with food (get the pork belly, truffle poutine, & squash gnocchi) and cocktails that are on point. If you dislike crowds, go during a weekday or make a reservation and skip the complaints. Perch is one of those well-rounded spots that's great for dates or going out with friends...or one of those nights where you feel like pretending you're at a NYC rooftop bar in summer.	1
Thai place is adorable. My friends and I come here for brunch and have never had an issue getting a table. The food is great and if you like Chilaquiles, it&#39;s amazing here!! They do bottomless mimosas and seriously never let you see the bottom of your glass...so watch out.	1
Fantastic place, great decor and great food/drinks. Very different from what Ive seen anywhere else, puts you in that perfect mood to eat, drink and just hang. Try the Sonju Yogurt alcoholic drink, you&#39;ll thank me for that one, killer! Well done guys!!	1
Way expensive for the quality of food. Maybe for the old days of the food truck, but not for a sit down	0
Dive bar and proud of it. This isn&#39;t my scene, but low key and cheap for a few drinks on a weeknight. $10 pitchers of beer. Good service. Sit at the bar or grab a table.	0
*Cost Effective Lunch - 5 stars	0
Dropped in on a lazy Saturday afternoon (Valentine's Day) without any expectations... Beautifully redone old home... Super welcoming staff... and it turned out there was a free Porto tasting the afternoon! We settled at a table, ordered one of the most delicious and light butter lettuce salads (BH salad) we have ever had. We were free to flit back and forth between the table and tasting - the server was very knowledgable about the Porto being served and enjoyed learning more about the drink and interacting with folks who came in. Things really picked up at happy hour (3-6pm daily) with festive Spanish music picking up the cheer throughout. We ordered a Grenache/Syrah red on recommendation and enjoyed thoroughly a cheese monger plate with 3 cheeses. Staff very friendly and even helped us store our chicken apple sausage in their fridge (just came from market, not expecting to stop for so long)... All in all a perfect blend of neighborhood charm and opportunity to try a fine selection of drink and food. Highly recommend when you're in the Madrona area!	1
Yum!	1
Trust me, this place may not offer the glamour from the interior, it may lack some curb appeal but I consider it a Hollywood historical diner. I get good vibes from this place and it has left a mark in my late night dinings. In addition to great service, great memories i've shared with friends and delicious classic Jewish cuisine, the pastries are a must have to take home. It is located in Fairfax just a few blocks from ethiopian town.. definitely attracts diverse crowd. And, I have seen Adrien Garner here. And no i won't pick up the name I just dropped. ;-)	1
Possibly the best burger I've ever had in life -- juicy but not greasy. Fries perfect crust perfect salt. Dare I say it? Better than Red Mill.	1
Today was my first at Perch. I loved it!I had the French toast and it was super delicious and filling. I extremely recommend it, you could not go wrong with this dish.Not only do I really like there food but the atmosphere is awesome. They have live music that is very beautiful for brunch! I will definitely be retuning!!	1
Yum! So this place other than having a great name is a bit hard to park at, but its right next to a metro train stop and has decent freeway access. The joint seems fairly popular with those that wanna get some takeout or have found parking somewhere in the adjacent area.I came in super hungry and ended up getting a single slice. I was stoked that they sold pie by the slice, as often times, when I am alone, I cant eat a whole pie. Unless I want to feel like a bloated sow. Pro Tip: There is a mini super hard to see out of parking lot on the east side of this place, but backing out into traffic is a bit daunting...So I got a slice of pepperoni. I was extremely pleased to start digging into it with the herbs mixed into the thin crust. It was pretty tasty. The cheese was the right amount of this slice as well. The bad thing is that there were not that many pepperoni's on it =\ I would definitely have wanted a few more per slice if I had gotten a whole pie.They have a lot of specialty pizzas here so pay attention to the board up above to see what all is available for your consumption here in purgatory. Definitely its a place to visit and enjoy more than once. YUM!	1
Visited The Roof for a lunch meeting this week and came away with a positive impression of the place, largely down to the excellent view and service. The latter can range from overbearing and disruptive to non-existent at the other end of the scale but the balance was just right at the Roof.<br><br>Food-wise the selection is adequate for lunch. Fairly typical fare for this this type of mid-range restaurant. If you&#39;re willing to pay much more for a fancier experience then try the Penninsula Rooftop. My burger was ok. Nothing too memorable. In fact slightly disappointing with the lackluster cheese bread and lukewarm fries - hence 4 stars not 5. Serve In&amp;Out burgers here and you&#39;d get 5!<br><br>If it&#39;s a clear warm day (ie. 90% of days in LA!) and you&#39;re in the area then come here and you&#39;ll be happy you did.	1
Overall a wonderful dining experience... The restaurant itself provides a cute and quiet space.  The food and service was also excellent.  Our desert was slightly delayed (we barely even noticed) and our waiter was incredibly apologetic.  When we went to pay, he had taken the wine off of our bill... A nice surprise!  I will definitely go back again soon.	0
A group of 5 celebrated a milestone birthday.  I ordered a cake in advance from the Rio Bakery.  The manger picked it up and had it delivered to the table wen we finished our meal.  Afterwards, our server stored the leftover cake in theirr wine cooler, so we could pick it up afte a show we attended.  I appreciated their exceptional service.	1
I&#39;ve only been to the rooftop bar, which provides a super awesome view of Pershing Square and downtown L.A. The crafted cocktails are great, a little pricey, but great. If you&#39;re a fan of ginger crafted cocktails try the Penicillin.	1
Absolutely stunning food. Bold fresh flavors. Must have appetizers are shrimp scampi, crab dip with homemade ritz crackers and nona&#39;s meatballs. I also loved the grilled barramundi and brussel sprouts. Will definitely come back!	1
Took about 15mins (if not longer) to get our TINY over priced drinks. Busboys were very nice and a lot more attentive than our server. I expected more from this place, definitely wont come here again.	0
I stopped in last night solo to try out this new spot in my neighborhood. The Crabby Shack did not disappoint! It was cute and small, with not a ton of people inside but great music (old school hip hop while I was there). Very chill vibe which is nice in comparison to a lot of the overly packed places on Franklin.<br><br>I had the crab roll - so good! It was super full of crab meat that was well seasoned and the bun was tasty too! The crab flavored chips were a great side too, and next time I wanna try some of their other side orders!<br><br>One of the owners (I forget her name) came by to say hi - she was suuuuuper sweet and I was kinda geeked to see business owners in the hood that still have faces like mine :)<br><br>I&#39;ll definitely be a regular there now (my girlfriends have been dying to try it so now I can vouch for them!). Only took off one star because I wish I could have had a beer with my crab roll :)	1
I wouldn&#39;t normally dine on Park Ave South, but work brought me here. Also, I am a vegeterian, but go with the flow when with other people. That said, the warm staff immediately helped me get over the semi-formal vibe, and the rich, meaty courses I tried were outstanding. The osso bucco lasagna with house made pasta and a marrow-filled bone in the center was the MVP (most valuable plate). The eggplant and the mushroom small plates from the antipasti bar were also delicious. Not groundbreaking, but so succulent that they are worth ordering. Did not try the short ribs or lobster farro soup - but I have no doubt they are on par with the lasagna.	1
excellent cuban desserts<br>solid croquettes, pastelitos, bocadillos (try the mini one with ham cheese and ground meat)<br>lots of variety, including the merenguito, dulce de coco, capuchinos, etc.	1
This is a nice spot for late night diner. I tried abalone chowder, it&#39;s light and delicious. By the way, the little beef dish is the best! It&#39;s awesome.	1
I just had the most amazing bowl of noodles in my life!!! I ordered the spicy miso ramen and it was everything I ever expected and more. The presentation was amazing. A bowl full of flavor, colors, and texture. The restaurant was very nice, clean, and had great service. I would definitely drive four hours for another bowl.I've gone back a few times and still remains amazing!!	1
I go to the O.P. weekends for lunch. Except they take cash only everything is nice in this restaurant.<br><br>The steak is good. old atmosphere is reserved, you really feel like you are in a different time, if there are not many customers around. Fast service, big steaks!<br><br>It can get a little crowded if there is a Staples - Expo or LA Live event.	1
Food was okay, nothing terribly exciting. The pizza was probably the best thing we ate, and its crust was dry in a bad way.Drinks were interesting, but for a place trying to sell you on beer, they had pretty brief offerings and were out of about 3 of them.Service. Oh the service. We had a waiter that I'd had at bacar before and he was delightful there. Here, I don't know what happened. We didn't see him much, had to flag him down a few times (though the food related issues were not his fault) we sat forever waiting for the check and waiting for our cards to be rung up. Non-waiter issues on service were worse, we called before we ventured out there, they told us they opened at 4pm for drinks. We got there at 4:45pm, and were turned away, they weren't open yet. Maybe you should communicate that with the whole staff. We sat down at our table probably around 5:15, and were told by the hostess, "I don't think this will be a problem, but I need this table by 8pm." Honey, if we take more than 2.75 hours to eat pizza and appetizers and drink beers, I'm going to guess it's not due to us, it's due to slow service. Our salumi plate came out with just 2 of the 3 items, we had to ask to get our 3rd item. We ordered the bean puree, it never arrived, but showed up on our bill. Which brings up the huge bone I have to pick with Starbelly's owner/sister resto, Beretta. Not once have we gotten the bill at one of their restaurants, and not had to check the bill against what we got, what we ordered and what we were charged for. CHECK YOU BILL THOROUGHLY WHEN YOU GO TO STARBELLY OR BERETTA. The bathroom was nice. That would be the only thing that would bring me back. And too bad about our nice waiter working there, I would have gone back to bacar just for him.	0
I was brought here for dinner for a first &#34;official&#34; date...very cute and romantic place. The building is charming and view speaks for itself. My boyfriend and I both work in downtown LA, so we see beautiful views everyday, but at night time this was perfect. While we waited for our table, we went upstairs for a drink, we were seated on the patio outside, by a fire...super cute and romantic. Food was delicious! Great place for a date! Great vibe, not overly crowded and a great atmosphere and energy!	1
Quality is fresh and presentation looks nice but it's overpriced for what you get and the wait time to get your food is way too long.	0
Way too expensive for both food and drink, super hectic, loud space; given what I have learned about the modern New York speakeasy style, you&#39;re supposed to be paying for a quiet, intimate experience. But instead me and two others were crammed into a corner table with barely room to put our plates down next to each other. Not my idea of a good time. The marrow poppers sounded promising, but as they arrived and we realized we had just paid $13 for 3 little pastries, we felt cheated. The cocktails were good, but at $15-$16, our deliciousness/value meter was pretty much at equilibrium.<br><br>The only truly amazing thing on the menu was the $45 porterhouse steak, a really good piece of meat that is pretty much being sold at face value.<br><br>You can keep the prices the same, and increase the value of the experience, or decrease the prices and leave the experience as it is today. But you can&#39;t double dip.	0
Consistently good cooking. Authentic, not Americanized. Specials are always a good choice. Good service.Free glass of wine with Yelp is a plus.	1
Went to dinner for a celebratory dinner last night with my bf and daughter. Service throughout the meal was poor, with our waiter never checking on us to see if we were ok or needed more drinks. Food was good - burger very good, grandma pizza just ok - crust was dry and the other pizza we had with spicy soppressata and pickled peppers being the highlight. We ordered two desserts, which took forever to come out, but when they did were worth the wait. The cookie sandwich with butter crunch ice cream was outstanding....until my daughter discovered a giant metal cap 3/4&#34; baked into the cookie. I had tried to bite it and thought it was a big chocolate chunk so gave it to her only for her to realize it was metal. When we called the host over, he was horrified, ran the cap to the kitchen, then came back to apologize and ask if I was ok. He never offered to bring another dessert for us. When we asked for the check, they took off the two desserts and two drinks and left us a $50 bill. I really felt as if they should have comped the whole bill. A serious medical problem was narrowly avoided whether we could have broken a tooth or worse swallowed this screw. I would have maybe gone back if they had comped us but now never will and will tell everyone I know to stay away	0
Severely disappointed. $9 and some change for a mediocre carne asada super burrito? NEVER again! I've never felt so disappointed in a burrito before, as silly as that sounds. Lack of flavor. The saucey-ish salsa wasn't that great either IMO.. I just prefer the chunkier type. To me, this place is overhyped and totally not worth it. I'd rather go to ........Chipotle. =X	0
I went here on one of those coupon deals - in short, I was delighted!Great appetizers, great entree's, fun staff - in total, I cannot wait to return here	1
Love this place! Every Friday my coworker and I have lunch waiting for us (we call ahead) because we&#39;re always in a hurry. We get veggie pad Thai, veggie rolls with brown rice, edamame to die for, and tons of extra spicy mayo because we pretty much drink it. And one of their delicious teas !	1
Food is basically the same as the Hollywood Blvd locations... amazing. However, I still prefer the Hollywood Blvd. location because the ambiance is better and they have outdoor seating.	1
My family and I love eating at Bobby's. We tried it because we had seen them on them on Diners Drive-ins and Dives. Their mochi chicken is my son's favorite chicken nugget.	1
So I've been here before they remodeled the place and I really enjoyed their honey wings and wrap. Now, I came back afterwards thinking about the wrap and looking forward to having it and they're going to tell me I cant order it because its on the lunch/to go menu. I dont understand why they would modify their menu when it was fine. Disappointed and probably won't be back anymore	0
No Management. Sorry Sammies. Sorry employees. Lots of $$$$ for such a sorry deli. What more can I tell you?	0
Good but pricey food.Most importantly, the place has cockroaches. Need I say more? Sigh. If you insist. My coworkers came here for lunch one day and saw two huge cockroaches run across the floor. The waiter quickly stepped on one of them right next to a dining couple while the other one scurried away. This means that there is still at least one big cockroach in this restaurant. It probably reproduced already. Gross.	0
My bf and I luckily went here on one of the very few nice days in Seattle during the month. Because we called the night before, we were only able to get a dinner reservation at 5pm. However, they said they could seat us on the large outdoor patio that they just opened because of the nice weather. Also, since it's right in Pike Place, we got to tour the area and see all the fun shops before eating dinner. Very convenient location! We decided to come here at around 4:30pm to take advantage of the happy hour + also get dinner. They were very attentive and accompanied our decision of doing happy hour + dinner. They actually had our outside table ready for the 5pm dinner so no problems whatsoever. Between the two of us, we had a wonderful time. I got two house wines (half off at happy hour) and he got two scotch on the rocks. We shared the calamari (not fried) as an early appetizer. Soooooooooo yummy. Melts in your mouth and has a little spicy kick. We didn't even use the bread while eating this dish...although the bread, once we did try it, was soo doughy and fresh. After drinking and drinking, we decided to order dinner. We got the green lasagne and a grilled shrimp caesar salad. We also got more wine - free with our entrees if we checked in on yelp! The lasagne came out piping hot and bubbling and the lettuce in the caesar salad looked as fresh as it can come. One bite into the lasagne....wow o m gee. BEST lasagne I've ever had hands down. It looks heavy but the combination of the light handmade/homemade noodles and fluffy cheese...best thing EVERRRRRR. I would come here weekly just for the lasagne. Caesar salad was very good - shrimp was very tasty and my bf ate them all up and he usually doesn't like shrimp.	0
Definitely a hidden gem for Bay Ridge. It&#39;s a small place, but it&#39;s very nice. It feels like you&#39;re eating at someone&#39;s kitchen. The chef comes over to talk to you. He prepares all the food, including the bread. Service was excellent, as was the food. I&#39;ll definitely be back here.<br><br>Make sure to get a pot of Moroccan mint tea!	1
Man, where do I even begin? I went here with a group of buddies for a night of wings and relaxation and was truly let down. First of all we arrive there and we are told there is a 15 minute wait, OK, no big deal we will wait. After 30 minutes of waiting we are finally seated, OK, no big deal again I understand the workings and the difficulties in the food and beverage industry. We wait a little longer and out waitress, who happens to have a strange Snooki resemblance and complex shows up and takes our drink orders and leaves with an attitude. After another short wait our drinks are given to us by a different waitress helping our table, meanwhile our waitress shows up to take our food orders. That was the last we saw of Snooki for the duration of our meal. Not only were our drinks never refilled, but we were also never checked up on, nor did our waitress deliver our plates (once again yet another waitress brought the food). Lo and behold check time comes around and Snooki decides to show herself and act all friendly as if we had been the best of buddies since grade school AND even had the &#34;courtesy&#34; to pencil in 15, 20, and 25% tip rates on the check. Hence, this finally set me off and there was no way I would tip such a two-faced and inconsiderate waitress so we pay the bill, and get up to leave. But wait, the episode does not end there, no sir/ma&#39;am, Snooki picks up the ticket as we are leaving notices that we &#34;forgot&#34; to write in the tip and chases me down the end of the parking lot as if I was the Jesse James equivalent of the &#34;dine and dash&#34; bandits. When she finally catches up as I am getting into my car she has the nerve to announce to me that I had &#34;forgotten&#34; to include my tip to which I responded to the reasons aforementioned for the omission of tip. As I am displeased to report she was not too accepting of this explanation and proceeded to curse me out and use such verbiage that even the &#34;guidoest&#34; of guidos on the Jersey shore would be offended to process through their thick skulls. Never have I ever been so disgusted leaving a food establishment that I did not even bother reporting her. Either way there is no way I will ever set foot again in this Hooters. I would rather watch a 12-hour Jersey Shore marathon paired along with the non-stop screeching of nails on a chalkboard than see her face again. Shame on you.	0
Very good, for brunch and dinner. A little pricy for what you get, but consistently tasty.	1
once upon a time, i would have given the daily an amazing review. After my experience last week, never fuckin go there again. main reason is that the current manager is a totally unprofessional dbag. he has loud phone conversations while stuffing his mouth, proceeds to yell at his employees from the table he&#39;s sitting at, all while giving everyone else dirty looks. my order took forever, there wasn&#39;t even that many people there. the sandwiches were skimpy as hell, mostly bread and condiments. i placed an order to go and never got it, was repeatedly told 5 minutes. i asked to cancel the order (kids chicken tender and fries) after 30 minutes. the manager was a complete douche about it, no apology, no excuses, no nothing. practically threw the receipt at me. on my way out, i noticed one of the employees was 1/2 way through the chicken tenders, awesome.	0
Just went again and had an actual meal and thought it was really great! The food is pretty &#34;home down&#34; ale marinated chicken, braised beef, pasta, pizza but they definitely know how to cook!<br><br>Really enjoyed everything. But beware appetizers are definitely teeny tiny! I thought the desserts were all great!!	1
Amazing! Lots of options. Fresh ingredients. Very nice staff!! I was deciding between soup or sandwich. I picked the sandwich and they brought me a cup of soup with my meal anyway.	1
the only thing i need to say: $1 oyster night. i&#39;ve been to oyster nights where there are shells and yucky bits or the oysters aren&#39;t really the best - the churchill does it right with amazing quality and impeccable service. grilled octopus and fries were also delicious, but next time, we&#39;re totally trying the scallops (which the table next to us had - looked amazing!)	1
Been to this Power Pizza location several times because they are right next door to my favorite hookah lounge...and they have never let me down with the quality of the pie. I usually get a couple of slices of cheese on some whole wheat crust and its always fresh and delicious. It&#39;s the perfect thing to compliment you&#39;re evening when you&#39;ve been hanging out with friends at the hookah lounge, smoking and having drinks. The prices are super cheap and well worth the money.	1
Thoroughly disappointed! <br><br>At first, I was excited that the restaurant served Filipino cuisine as well as launched by a chef from Top Chef. Also, after enjoying authentic Filipino cuisine from the Philippines, I was craving a good fix here. However, the general lack luster experience combined with mediocre food did not win me over for its overpriced menu. <br><br>Even if Pig and Khao&#39;s ambiance is suppose to be a casual experience, their staff did not know ANYTHING. We decided to order the 5 course tasting menu for a fix price. For one thing, our waitress, although courteous and nice, did not tend to us as frequently despite the lack of patrons at the place. FYI, we were there for an early dinner around 5-6pm and there was only another couple having dinner. Did I also mention how there were 3-5 staff members just aimlessly waiting around? Not cool. <br><br>The next thing that disturbed our experience was that when we received each dish, the presenter, who was not our waitress, did not even try to explain what we were getting. (Even if he did try to explain, he was either on mute or he just explained the meat type.) I even asked for better elaboration on one of the dishes and whether if it was Filipino .The presenter did not know whether if it was a Filipino dish or what the dish was at all. HOW IS THIS A TASTING MENU EXPERIENCE IF WE DON&#39;T KNOW WHAT WE&#39;RE TRYING? <br><br>I&#39;m not even trying to be anal about our experience. I did not even try to make it a big deal during our dinner, but after thinking about our experience, I will not come here again. <br><br>The second part is that even the dinnerware seemed like cheap $1 items you&#39;d find in Chinatown. I don&#39;t have anything against cheap dinnerware, but if I&#39;m paying for an ambiance and an experience at a place, I&#39;d expect better utensils. Next time, I can just eat at Chinatown for authentic food at a lower price. <br><br>Food was mediocre. It only got 2 stars because our food came out fresh and I liked the coconut rice.	0
(We booked through the RESERVE app, and that experience was excellent!)Flawless food, gorgeous cocktails, and excellent service/staff attitude. Ambiance is 1930s french hipster. If you hate wooden hairpin chairs, reconsider, but otherwise there's nothing bad to say about CHURCH&STATE	1
Well everyone talks about this place, so I figured I needed to try it. Sorry to say, I was very disappointed. My husband and I went for breakfast and payed $35.00 for food that was frozen and the re-heated. If you want good food this is not the place to go. Way over priced! It reminded me of gas station food and the coffee was sooo bad! The location is great, but food not so, guess I&#39;m not sure what all the hype is about.	0
Best looking Thai restaurant in all of Hollywood food is perfect drinks are amazing all brand-new interior and modern decor yet Thai inspired. CLEAN beyond what I&#39;ve come to expect from a Thai restaurant.	1
Nope. Not a fan. I understand the appeal, but I just don&#39;t see it.<br><br>At first, I thought that maybe my distaste for the place was due to Gage being a more formal restaurant then I was expecting. High prices; small portions: I get that that&#39;s how such restaurants are, but hear me out...<br><br>IF a restaurant is SO fancy that it can charge $20 for three scallops and a three-inch line of sweet potatoes drawn with an icing bag, how can it justify a waiter being drunk?<br><br>Yep. Drunk. All four friends in attendance will agree. Imagine a creepy James Spader character who can&#39;t quite keep his eyes open. Imagine a waiter who keeps complimenting the ladies while continuously hiccuping. DRUNK.<br><br>So, does this restaurant have low standards for its employees? Does it assign the drunk waiter to the table of younger patrons? Here&#39;s the real question: regardless of WHY we had this experience, should this restaurant really have such a high opinion of itself?	0
We went here for dinner about a month ago. <br><br>We had the samosa chat for an app (cubed samosa with yogurt and mint sauce). It was good but I&#39;d probably try something different next time. Seems like it&#39;s made out of leftover samosas.<br><br>We also got raita which was good but a little tarter than I like. The garlic naan was yummy. <br><br>For main courses we had prawn biriyani and mateer paneer. The prawn biriyani was tasty though the rice was on the al dente side. The matter paneer had a nice sauce. <br><br>The dinner was good overall, but there are better Indian restaurants in town.	0
The title says it all. The meat on all the dishes I have ordered tasted old stale dry or too fatty and greasy. Covering it with a generous and tasty sauce doesn't disguise the piss-poor protein below. I have found that once your order has been taken and delivered to your table the staff doesn't give a hoot about your experience the quality of your meal and is rather insensitive if not altogether negligible toward the customer. I have enjoyed two dishes here but found three others unappetizing and one down right inedible. I drive by this restaurant almost everyday and from now on I'll keep on driving past it.	0
Crappy service. Decent drink selection, but we were the forgotten table so it didn't matter. Cool location in a dark alley between Asian restaurants. Ordered food, 20 minutes later told that it was 86'd. Other item we ordered was also out. Over it by then, time to go to Wurstkuche instead.	0
I gave this 2 stars. If I go back and breakfast is killer I *might* bump to a 3.	0
Nice atmosphere with great view of DTLA. (Bar only)	1
I was skeptical about this place because I heard through word of mouth that it was overrated. Maybe that saved the meal for me cuz I didn't expect much more than hype. If anything, I was kinda holding Father's Office burger in the back of my mind as a gauge with which to judge this Umami burger.I was dead set on getting the Umami Burger since it was my first time here, and I felt obligated to get the staple menu item my first time around. However, the waiter informed me that it has caramelized onions and shitaki mushroom inside. I really dislike onions (except in pho and salsa) and shitaki mushroom. And I didn't want to order the burger without them cuz it'd be like going to In-N-Out and order a cheeseburger with meat, cheese, and ketchup only (I hate it when people do that - I used to work at In-N-Out). So despite my initial plan to order the Umami, I went with the Pastramimami Burger instead. It was so good. The meat is juicy, and it's not like sliced pastrami you get at Togo's. It's was a thick piece of delicious, melt-in-your-mouth pastrami like you'd get at Katz's Deli in NY. Like I said, it was so good. Also, the sweet potato fries and cheesy tater tots were scrumptious. All in all, the food was awesome. Service-wise, our waiter was friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu. He didn't even flinch when I added items to-go twice. He was always ready to help and was friendly and responsive when we called him over. I'm looking forward to the next time I can make it out to the joint and try another burger.My experience here was also a little better because I saw, met, and took a picture with Matthew Morrison, who plays Will Schuester on Glee. Good times :)	1
Great joint to get a bagel &amp; lox, some free pickles, an egg cream, tomato juice, and some huge pastrami on rye sandwiches. Basically reminiscent of my numerous east coast dining experiences growing up with a Jewish dad. You can have breakfast at any time- that&#39;s what I want access to! Not in the mood? Have a matzo ball soup and potato knish- yum! It&#39;s a little weird that the knish comes with gravy, but it sure tastes good. My sister swears by the patty melt.<br><br>This place has all the markings of a good deli/diner. Always crowded but you&#39;re still seated fast; this place is 24 hours and right by Cinefamily. Nice and clean with a good wait staff. Food is moderately priced and my favorite to grab on Fairfax after a movie. Lots of history here.. seems the older these diners are, the better they perform.	1
And so after one of those fabulous mornings where you run out of the house accomplishing errands I became a bit famished and I decided to finally stop at Mikes Deli. I frequently pass the small store and never stop, but today my sandwich fix begged for more than a $5 foot long. The basics are like this, They have a great selection of Snack Valley snacks- you know nuts, trail mix, dried mango and the like. As well as a good selection of Kettle Chips. Sea Salt and Vinegar! <br>The Sandwhich selection is as extensive as te selection of deli meat they employ. The list of specialty sandwhiches is short, however the condiment list is quite extensive. They even have sprouts! The prices are ok and the sizes are commendable. I look forward to gonig back to try a club on Sqauw- I hear it&#39;s the cats meow!	1
This place was not impressive.<br><br>Went here on a saturday around 11 (prime brunch time, I know). There were about 6 of us. The restaurant was not packed, but was crowded. We were told we would wait 45 mins. We were directed to the back deck where we were promptly forgotten about for 1.5 hours. It was about 40 degrees that day so we were less than pleased with our waiting arrangements.<br>After we were seated, service was better, but the long wait left most of our group bitter.<br>The menu gives you the impression that this place is trying to be fancier than it is. The type of place that adds ingredients with french names to look impressive on the menu.<br>When we got our food, my suspicions were confirmed. The portions were small, but the food was well organized on my plate (so that counts for something, right?). My friend who ordered the waffles was the most dissapointed as he recieved a few oversized crackers. Everyone&#39;s impression of the portion sizes was &#34;are you kidding me?&#34; <br>Overall this place did not wow me. I understand high priced, small portion foods are what some people are looking for, but not at brunch. The quality of the food did not make up for the lack of quantity. <br>Bottom line, if you come here hungry, expect to leave that way.	0
Always friendly, always delicious.<br>For Miami, especially the SW area you&#39;re better off getting a shawarma sandwhich here than anywhere else. definately unlike the offensive ones in Kendall...<br>fresh salad, nice soups, the pastries are wonderful.<br><br>Great little grocery and market with fair prices. Theres a reason why this place stands the test of time. I will always support this well run family business.	1
I always browse Yelp to find new places to eat, and even though I&#39;ve lived in Kendall for the majority of my life, I always drive by this place on a regular, with little regard that it even existed. I came across it&#39;s amazing reviews on Yelp and after quickly deciding to come eat here, I realized where my GPS was taking me. Right around the corner from my house!!<br><br>As I walked in, I was immediately impressed. It was cute, quaint, and it&#39;s decor was extremely detailed to fit the Italian theme. So let&#39;s see if their food does the same...<br><br>My husband and I sat down pretty quickly on Saturday night at 7pm. To start off, we wanted the Mozzarella Caprese, but my hopes we&#39;re immediately let down when the waitress said they were out. What? Interesting. It took us a minute to browse the menu, but I had finally decided to order true authentic italian food: Bruschetta to start and then the Lasagna and my husband the Spaghetti and Meatballs. <br><br>Bruschetta was amazing! Very fresh tomatoes and the oil drizzled on was just the right amount. Perfect. Then the lasagna came out, it was just ok. Felt the lasagna was a bit burnt on the top and the Parmesan cheese on top was from a store bought bottle, not fresh. But overall it was good. But nothing to write home about. My husband loved his meal. Thought everything was perfectly done. <br><br>We decided to skip dessert this time around, but overall our experience was quite pleasant. Nice to have a nice italian place in the neighborhood, that we plan on coming back to!	1
After reading some reviews here I decided to give this place a try....since I also live close by. Frankly I was not impressed with the hamburger that I ordered...normal bun and additions. Good onion rings though but there are other places with great tasting hamburgers. Everything on the menu is a la cart and credit cards are accepted.	0
see, this is the kind of place that shouldn't need to be reviewed. i suppose if you don't live in LA and you're visiting and wondering if this place is good, that's one thing. but if you've been in los angeles for more than 6 months and you don't know how good the apple pan is, you should be deported to somewhere like council bluffs and hate your life forever.this is the best hamburger in southern california. this is my favourite place to eat in all of california.a piece of advice, though, if you come here for the first time, make it known. don't try to pretend like you know what you're doing, the service is quick and surly. if you sit down and don't ask for a menu, you will be asked what you want within 30 seconds and if you don't answer him in 10 seconds he'll walk away. because of this, however, you only have to wait 2-3 minutes for your food, and if it's later, they start giving you free stuff. the newest employee has been there for 17 years, and these guys know what they are doing. not mean, just efficient. i love it.don't come with a big crowd, don't come around lunch and expect to get a seat right away, if you're in a rush or are in a big crowd stand near the register and place your order to go. there's about 25 seats total, and even as a party of one you can expect to wait for a seat for up to 15 minutes around noon.i think all of this adds to the experience, and the burgers are perfectly made dressed and served, the pie is fresh and delicious, and the price is right.oh, and don't ask for tomatoes. they don't have them.	1
i called yesterday for take out and went and picked up my sandwich. i ordered the brickhouse club and i opted to just stick with the salad that comes with it...i really love fries...but i don't need them lol...when i got back to work which is just around the corner i opened the box up...the sandwich looked yummy and thank goodness for them i love sprouts because that sandwich was on sprout overload!!! the bread was really good..the sanwich itself was ok i guess...no the best that ive had but nevertheless i ate it....but lets move on to the salad...old wrinkly greens that were bruised and it was so tiny...uhhhh 1 bite and that was it for me...i shoulda got the fries...oh well...another thing that i didnt like was when i walked in there was a dog inside laying on the mat in the front door...now dont get me wrong i looooveee doggies but what kinda made me a lil disgusted is one of the waitresses was petting it and then she went over and refilled water at one of the tables without washing her hands...YUCK! anywho...its possible i will give them another shot being as though they are so close to my job but it will definately be a last resort..	0
Every dish was remarkable, esp. the tortellini en brodo and the whole fish, service was friendly and well paced, the room modern sort of the Barbara Bestor look. Be ready for some noise like all the very good spots on this side of town. Best food in Silver Lake.	1
I used to frequent this place back in 2009. Loved the price and simplicity of the place, but over the years this place has changed not only in service, but food as well. Can&#39;t say I love eating here anymore. I still go for bubble tea, though.	0
Good food for good price. Nice find. Definitely recommend for when you're looking for not the healthiest meal, but some good chicken wings with a korean twist. I had the fried chicken wings and the kyochon chicken wings and both were really good. Not a huge fan of the sauces besides buttermilk ranch. The restaurant can be cold. It's the middle of a hot, LA Summer and I saw a lot of people in hoodies in the restaurant.	1
I love this place. Their food & coffee is awesome.Would have given the place 5 stars if not for a couple things.1. They need to get fly nets for the baked goods. People don't want to buy pastries after a fly has landed on it. Yuck.2. I've witnessed some unclean practices by a certain male employee. Namely, he put his fingers in a to go order he packaged for me. A day later, I saw his push down garbage in a garbage can with a rag he used to wipe down the counters with. I hope management takes these mistakes seriously, it's just plain gross.	1
This was my second time here and I was so disappointed. It literally took about 30 minute to take our drink order, another 20 minutes to receive it, another 20 minutes to take our orders (btw 8.99 steak &amp; eggs is from 6a to 11a only!). They didn&#39;t even bring everything we ordered out until we pretty much had to beg for it.<br><br>Overall it was the worst service I have ever experienced in Vegas and the servers had no remorse but then again why should they. 2 stars because their food is good, I&#39;ll give you that but at what cost, you know?	0
A delicious disaster.	1
I&#39;ve been coming here for more than a decade (prior to moving to the West Valley). I always order the S-12 (SaTe&#39; House Special) but lately I&#39;ve been fancying the Chicken Ruby. <br><br>The service is good. Food is even better. It could get crowded at times. Expect to pay (for two) around $30-$40. You figure Tom Yung Gung for an appetizer, two house special and two thai iced teas and you&#39;re set. <br><br>Only problem I have with this place is that the parking can be frustrating. When that happens, I just go to the one in Maplewood &amp; Western.	1
I had not visited this chipotle in months so I decided to stop by for a quick meal. The line was long... when I looked around all the tables were dirty, I mean, disgusting dirty. We had to scream out our orders...The guy preparing the burritos was throwing the ingredients like he was throwing darts. I saw some to-go orders being prepared, nasty how he missed to container and some food was out of it. Next time I will drive to the Chipotle in Pinecrest or just go somewhere else.	0
Why the lack of stars?!? This place rocks!I have been here twice and mean to go again to try out their 10 dollar bottomless mimosas/wine on weekends. Both times, it was for a quick meal before a movie but we enjoyed ourselves thoroughly.First of all, the service is excellent. Smiles, courtesy, the whole bit. The food is excellent. It has a creative twist, which I appreciate. AND they have vegetarian options! This time, we got the roasted cauliflower which had some interesting spices and were good. I dono if they were worth 9 bucks though. We got the veggie burger which was amazing! It had a falafel/middle eastern type taste to it and was served with pita as the bun. I could eat 5 of these! So good! They came with delicious sweet potato fries. I wish they had special sauce to go with their fries given they are so creative with the rest of their food but just ketchup.My Dad got the short rib grilled cheese which he said was amazing.Save room for the (free with check in) banana creme pie!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It is SOOOOO good!!! It's light and airy with a chocolate crumb bottom and delicious banana. Omg so good! and it's free with check in! and they give you a pretty decent slice. I cannot wait to go back! Not to mention that it's super close to the theater/mall so you can park in the garages for free. They also have HH which is great!	1
I was looking for spots nearby work that deliver and since LA Cafe was the closest option, I picked here. I called in and ordered the Lobster Grilled Cheese since so many Yelpers recommended it. I called in and since I was paying by card, the man I spoke with asked for my card number, which I was uncomfortable giving over the phone.The $9.99 sandwich + the $2.50 delivery fee + tip to the delivery guy put me out $16. Worth it? No. The sandwich came with these deliciously seasoned chips, but the sandwich left me wanting. It consisted of lobster, brie cheese, mustard mayo, and tarragon, grilled with cheddar cheese on white country bread. The toasted bread was so yummy... but there was something off about lobster/cheese combo. I ate half and couldn't finish since the smell and flavor of all the ingredients together was so overwhelming, I wanted to gag. Possibly too much cheese?I ended up taking half my sandwich home, hoping to finish later. But I couldn't do it! I didn't want to waste it, so I ate the bread, which was by then soggy and mushy. Never getting the Lobster Grilled Cheese again. I'd try other items on the menu, but I'm not in a hurry.	0
Amazing place with delicious pizza! Everything tastes handmade and fresh, there is a rotating beer selection, and great ambiance.	1
Your typical brew pub with a respectable beer selection and a solid pub food menu (burgers, nachos, cheese curds, etc). Service was receptive and always made sure our glasses were full. What more can one ask for when in need of beer and a burger?	0
Cozy place, deeeelicious food and really, really good service. The Fulton sammich was stupendous, the empanada fantasic and the coffee really good. Really great place.	1
Great dining, reasonable prices. Loved the burger (to be eaten with fork and knife) and the gravy fries	1
Went with some locals on my trip for happy hour. This is seriously the best happy hour I have ever been to. Great deals-I think 1/2 off appetizers and pizza. Also, great drink specials! We had the vegan pizza-it was delicious! We also had another one, maybe the margherita? Others had the gnocchi and roasted brussel sprouts. Both of these are things I normally wouldn't get-but were so good! I am not a brussel sprouts fan, but these were so good, paired with the squash. Delicious. Additionally, I had the Chappaquiddick the crimson cosmo. I have GOT to figure out how to make the chappaquiddick. That is going to be my summer go-to drink. Seriously. Also tried the Ginger Fresh and Spice It Up. I love tequila, but was scared of the jalapeno in it. It was amazing. Just gave it a little delightful kick. Go for happy hour! The best deal ever!	1
I can appreciate a good hole in the wall restaurant as much as the next guy but this place is just rundown. They need some paint, cleaning, and decent lighting. <br><br>The only reason they get two stars is for the crab and order it to go. Everything else my group and I tried was either undercooked (read:raw in the middle) or from a bag not fresh. The shrimp I ordered were burnt and swimming in the water from the veggies on my plate. The parsley potatoes were just okay not good enough to forgive all the other food sins committed at the table.<br><br>The lone server was trying his best to accommodate everyone but the poor guy was all alone handling both phone orders and waiting tables. Will not return to this location.	0
Ha! Well, it was inexpensive. That&#39;s the one thing I can say nice about this overrated old school nothing of a restaurant. Bland as can be. Denny&#39;s is a far better choice, and I hate Denny&#39;s. It&#39;s hard to describe food this uninteresting. Rubbery flat scrambled eggs. Sausage from the 1950&#39;s. Room temperature french fries as your breakfast potato. I can&#39;t imagine why anyone would ever come back here. Versailles France should sue Versailles the restaurant for defamation.	0
Came in for brunch last week and had a great experience! First, there was absolutely no wait which is refreshing to see in Lincoln Park. The space is decorated really nicely, we were seated by a high table near the bar. Our waitress came by and brought coffee which was a Bow Truss blend, it was so delicious. Our waitress (and everyone we interacted with at Range) was incredibly friendly. <br><br>Range&#39;s brunch menu isn&#39;t very extensive, but all of the items are unique and interesting. I went with the maple-bacon sausage omelet and the boyfriend had the morning sandwich. As we started eating, there was no maple-bacon sausage to be found in my omelet. I opened it up to actually see if there was any inside and found two small pieces. I&#39;m not sure if they have the omelet ingredients already mixed and I got unlucky, but it was kind of disappointing. The two pieces of maple-bacon sausage were phenomenal and balanced the white cheddar, spinach, and potatoes so well. The apple mustard and almonds on top added a sweet component, the flavors in this dish were very well thought-out and delicious. The boyfriend really enjoyed his breakfast sandwich, he just kept wishing there was more pulled pork. He had also added an egg, because it only came with one, and felt it wouldn&#39;t have been substantial enough to only have one egg. <br><br>When we got the check, we were pretty surprised to see the coffee was $3.75 a cup. I understand it&#39;s a nicer coffee brand, but I feel this should be communicated before pouring because that&#39;s very pricey. Overall, Range has a great concept and their flavors are spot-on. However, the lack of bacon-maple sausage and pork on the sandwich are elements I think they can work on. I&#39;ll be back!	1
I stop by this place all the time! The bread, however, is surprisingly not the draw. The grits, served with a soft boiled egg, crispy thick cut bacon, and jalapeno sauce, is to die for! I&#39;ve tried other delicious delectable like the chicken liver toast with vinegar blueberries and short bread pancakes with mashed bananas and salted almonds. This is definitely a place to stop by for a easy, delicious, and affordable breakfast! I just wish they would open up an actual sit down restaurant. I would be there even more frequently than I already am!	1
such a fun time anytime you go. wonderful food!	1
Food was ok; some good, but music so loud we almost had to yell at each other and very dark	0
Amazing spot reminds me of my mothers cooking and the service was really good. Make sure you ask for the Jou-jou, that&#39;s black rice.	1
Stopped here on a Saturday at 615p and boy were we lucky to beat the crowd! By 630p the line was out the door and to the sidewalk! The cashier told us it would be like that through the rest of the night, and for the 40ish minutes we were there, it was. It was another good sign at how great the tacos might be.<br><br>Ordered the following and listed them in order of greatness:<br>Mahi (with Asian sauce)<br>Steamed Blue Crab<br>Big &amp; Little&#39;s (whitefish standard with tartar sauce)<br>Samurai (whitefish with jalapenos)<br>Spicy Thai<br>(My husband also tried the Lamb and the Hawaiian pork, he liked the Hawaiian pork best.)<br><br>Only problem with the Samurai and Spicy Thai is they definitely had a &#34;fish&#34; taste to me that made it hard to just enjoy the tacos.<br><br>These are semi-small tacos, about 5 bites each, so the price is great. For 7 tacos, as well as the Cajun fries and truffle fries, it cost us $24 for a Saturday night dinner together, great value.	1
Yep much much needed in this neighborhood! This place is so charming I <br>am personally obsessed with the tiles and the rustic feel. <br><br>And the barista who served me knew of one of my other hidden gem favorites - little Collins and was super nice to boot.<br><br>And this place smells amazing - the coffee smell that all good places need to have.<br><br>Equally important my iced americano was expertly made and the jazz in the background was super chill and soothing. Also this place has a/c but wins points in my book because they don&#39;t blast you out with it.<br><br>There&#39;s pastries here but no lunch options but to me this seems trivial.	1
I had the chicken tikka, and it was very delicious. They were out of the samosas when I went. My only gripe about this place is that the portions were rather small for what I paid for.	1
I&#39;ve been wanting to check out Perch for a longggg time. However, on Friday/Saturday nights, the line is always out the door. Like 45-to an hour wait. I hate waiting in line so I said screw that. I went to a Downtown LA Happy Hour Meetup event at Perch on a Thursday night, instead of a weekend night. <br><br>Perch is definitely a gorgeous spot with beautiful views of Downtown LA. The drink prices are reasonable as well. I just ordered a beer so ended up paying $6 for a beer. The drinks are definitely less pricer than the Standard in Downtown. The crowd during the weekdays is more business/upscale. Great for groups and if you want to be amongst a gorgeous view while enjoying your conversation! <br><br>I have not tried the food yet but would love to come back for dinner or brunch! It would be awesome if Perch could build a pool as well. They could generate more revenue that way! <br><br>Parking Tip: There is a lot across the street for $5 after 4PM.	1
My family and I went here for lunch and the atmosphere was a little divey but the food was good. We ordered the 2 ramen combos (one original ramen with CA roll & one spicy miso ramen with tuna sashimi) and an order of garlic fried rice. I liked the original ramen better than the spicy one but both were solid. The broths were flavorful but greasy. The pork melted in my mouth! I didn't like the tuna or CA roll. I thought they were rather fishy. My favorite was the fried rice! They use pork belly in it. Yum! I would come back but only for the original ramen and fried rice. Service was excellent and parking was easy since they have a private lot.	1
When reviewing (and subsequently giving low stars) I tend to feel bad; in this situation, it's because Suzu has clean facilities and friendly employees. At the same time, though, they serve god-awful food. I don't like to dole out 1-2 stars, but the ramen here truly doesn't deserve anything more than 1 star. (I'll allot another for the friendly service and overall cleanliness of the place.)I mean, that's why I came here: for the ramen. I'm in Japantown. I don't want any old ramen. I want good, solid Japanese-style ramen. The kind that gives you a facial when it's placed in front of you. The kind that has a chewy bite to its noodles, with a soft-boiled egg that adds creaminess to the pork-bone broth. The kind that has flavorful and moist chashu (pork slices), with bamboo and green onion added for flavor and texture contrast.Yeah, the ramen here had none of that. With too-salty a broth, an overcooked (and cold) hard-boiled half-egg, sinewy pieces of pork, and bamboo that overpowered the broth, I nearly cried into my bowl of soup. But I didn't, as that would only make it saltier than I could already handle. (And I like salty!)It was a $10 lesson, but now I know to search elsewhere for a good bowl of ramen.	0
Absolutely love this place. It&#39;s a short walk from my house so super convenient and the staff is always so nice. I love coffee and dancing so it&#39;s the ultimate one stop shop for me!	1
Gorgeous views of Downtown LA. Overpriced drinks, gross (messy) bathrooms.	0
I like to go to places many times to get to know them before I rate them on Yelp. I&#39;ve been to Paper or Plastik a lot of times over the past couple years (since it opened!) and I think it&#39;s about time I stop. <br><br>I&#39;m baffled when I hear people call this a good place to work. The seating is horribly close together, the chairs uncomfortable, barely any outlets if you have computer work to do, and the environment all together doesn&#39;t make me want to settle in. The coffee and food are overpriced and overrated, and the vibes from the people are pretty pretentious. There are better coffee joints for me out there. I feel like this is a place I&#39;d only go to anymore as a last resort.	0
Mi Ga is one of the vendors inside the Greenland foodcourt and they serve Korean and Korean Hawaiian plates. <br><br>I got a 2 meat plate off the &#34;Hawaiian BBQ&#34; menu. It comes with miso soup, rice and 4 side dishes that they let you pick. <br><br>The meat jun was tender since they did it quite flat, but there are better meat juns out there. The spicy pork though I really dug. It was a bit more sweet than most Korean daeji bulgogi, but the thin slices were tender and I liked the flavor of it quite a bit though it wasn&#39;t very spicy. Side dishes I chose was macaroni salad, broccoli, soy marinated potato and cabbage kimchee. All were good, but I was surprised how much I liked their kimchee. The miso soup was just the broth, no seaweed/tofu/onion. <br><br>I would definitely try more on their menu and get more of the spicy pork.	1
Maybe we hit a good night maybe they got a new cook but my first (and not last) trip to Harmon's was a great success. I had the bleu cheese burger and their famous fries. Never heard of the fries before but they are very good. Service was friendly prompt and I was drinking ice tea and the waitress kept an eye on my glass and refilled it without being asked. 	1
Located in the heart of chink town, you wouldn&#39;t expect to find a low-key, down to earth Italian eatery but this spot is a regular on my rotation. Nora&#39;s is great but I like this place better bc of the atmosphere, service, and food. Sundays for coffee and cookies is a must! I also recommend the pizza and all the pastas.	1
I FING LOVE THIS PLACE! With that being said the food is awesome I&#39;ve never had a single person complain that I&#39;ve gone with and some of the people I&#39;ve taken can always find something to complain about but not here!<br><br>Well ok Sunday we went to lunch and my friend couldn&#39;t eat pretty much anything on the menu but that&#39;s just cause she a damn picky vegetarian who doesn&#39;t like most veggies :p she did love the frys though... so see even she liked it!<br><br>Another group of us came in Monday at 10:15pm and they were super nice and didn&#39;t complain that we were there 15mins before they closed. They didn&#39;t rush us and we all left extremely happy with a buzz at 11:40pm <br><br>Plus they serve PBR in a can and a brown paper bag! And the mojitos are rad 2 of them and even some of the biggest drunks I know are giggling like a school girl who just got drunk for her 1st time :p<br><br>If your in to some yummy food and good drinks I say go there you won&#39;t be dissapoined!	1
I have lived near this place for well over a year and never knew it existed...can&#39;t really see anything from the street so I didn&#39;t know it was back there. Boyfriend wanted to try it so we went last night. Super pretty outdoor area...I felt like we were in a treehouse. Waiter was friendly and helpful with making suggestions when I asked for his opinion.... I am a picky vegetarian but still saw several things I wanted. Went with the pumpkin ravioli w/ sauteed spinach and it was amazing. Good wine, too. <br><br>We went about 6:30PM and there was only one other table of people but by the time we left it looked like almost every table was taken. Will definitely be back...seems like a great place to take my parents when they are in town.<br><br>Subtracting one star because I think they allow smoking out there? Doesn&#39;t really feel like you are outdoors, and the tables were close together...yet the dude right next to us lit up a few cigarettes. For real?! Ick.	1
$20 for a burrito? Don't visit this restaurant for the Triple Threat. They are obviously not interested in clientele other than their local customers. We visited as we were finishing up a two day trip to SF.. Every eating surface was covered in crumbs and spills from previous customers. The staff was very unfriendly, as we were clearly not locals. They laughed at us and sarcastically thanked us as we left. The burrito was Ok, possibly worth $8, certainly not $20. I have had much better burritos for $5. Don't waste your time on this place. The order of chips and salsa - a bowl with 7-10 chips and a bunch of crumbs at the bottom. The bathroom was disgustingly filthy.	0
I'm writing this after just leaving this place. It was all bad. I ordered the takoyaki, gyoza, and pork belly ramen. My partner ordered the spicy tuna bowl. Everything food wise was fine, save for the ramen. It had a not so great texture and taste to me. Which I tried to tell the waitress. That's when things went downhill. She was rude. Condescending. And just wouldn't listen to me when I tried to tell her about my ramen. I was pretty upset and cut my dinner early, paid, and left asap. I had to go somewhere else for me dinner. It was just all bad.	0
Nice restaurant, pleasant dining area, friendly courteous wait staff, appetizers very good, and Cesar Salad   was delicious, also home made pasta was a nice surprise.. Unfortunately, was not completely impressed with main course a seafood medley shrimp, scallops and fresh crab meat, although the seafood was &quot;fresh&quot;, was expecting it to be sauteed in a white wine sauce, and it was , however should have been sauteed for much longer leaving the main course to be unintentionally bland ... disappointing given this dinner was a special occasion and Luna Blu was only serving 4 entrees that night and I was expecting more given prior dining experiences here.. We will be back though.. but not for a while..	0
Synopsis of things you should know (culled from the other reviews) 	1
Kogi Trucks: Amazing.<br>Chego: Solid.<br>POT: Meh.<br><br>Roy Choi has finally disappointed me :(. I saw this restaurant mentioned in an article about the Best New Restaurants in LA so I came with my friends to check it out. The restaurant is located inside a hotel, valet parking is $8 for 3 hours with validation - good luck finding street parking! You will spot the restaurant right away since there is a neon green sign that says &#34;POT&#34; in a dark corner.<br><br>My friends and I got seated right away though it was very crowded and busy. My friends liked the table setting and bibs provided. The atmosphere here is really loud and hectic.<br><br>Banchan: Green Onions, Bean Sprouts, and Cucumbers. NO KIMCHI?! What?! Yes, you have to pay extra for kimchi.... SIGH<br><br>Jamaal Wilkes: Silky Tofu, Shrimp, Clams, Mussels, Kimchi, Scallions, Pork Belly, Egg - Not sure if it was just me, but this one tasted kinda funky. The tofu was good, shrimp, clams, and mussels were over cooked and barely any. Pork belly was delicious. But the soup/broth tasted funky to me.<br><br>Beep Beep: Uni Dynamite Rice Bowl - This is what I came for and I was not impressed. First of all, the &#34;Bowl&#34; is more like a tiny plate. I understand that Uni is expensive, but dang I didn&#39;t expect the dish to be so small. Pretty much one spoonful per person and it was gone. The dish was rich, salty, crispy, and for some reason acidic. I would rather not have the acid in there.<br><br>Oodle Your Noodle Of The Day: Probably the best thing I had here. Cold noodles. Very refreshing, light, and full of flavor.<br><br>Maybe I came on a bad day? This place didn&#39;t impress me. Expensive Korean food. At least I got to see Roy when he walked in like a boss!	0
Stopped by 4 &amp; 20 on a roadtrip through Wisconsin and it was amazing. The place is a little hard to find, it's behind Milo's and if there was a sign out front we didn't see it. Walking into the cafe there's the bakery section and ordering counter straight ahead and a couple of tables to the left. Not much seating, especially if you have a larger party, and it was completely full by the time we left. Decorations are really cute, with wall decals, local art on the walls, and fresh flowers on the table. The menu is short and sweet and I was a little worried I wouldn't be able to find something I liked, but we ordered a couple different things and they were all good. The soup of the day was Tomato Gazpacho and it was delicious. Obviously made from fresh tomatoes and paired with cashews, which I've never had in a soup before but gives it an interesting texture. The Veggie Italian sandwich was the real winner - roasted summer squash, marinated buffalo mozzarella, baby arugula, tomato &amp; giardiniera on ciabatta. Fresh cheese, fresh vegetables, slightly crunchy ciabatta, with a slight kick from the giardiniera... it was amazing. And I don't even like squash. The drinks (pineapple lemonade!) were good as well, and top notch service (the guy at the counter patiently answered all our questions and didn't miss a beat when we continued to add things to our order). Almost makes me wish I lived closer to Madison, just so I could get breakfast/lunch here!	1
Great pizza and great staff!! Def will be my new fav spot!! And we got a free slice :) def a hood gem!!	1
The Good: For a diner, the food is special. Great desserts and holy shit, corn flakes with milk! The Bad: Way too crowded with hipsters on the weekendsThe Ugly: They got rid of the Fred McMurray...NOT COOL.	1
Came here for a birthday celebration in early December. Our reservation was made for 12 people at 8:30pm. <br><br>Day before the meal the restaurant called asking if they could push back the reservation to 8:45. Day of the meal they called again asking if they could push the reservation back to 9:15 but they&#39;d buy the party a round of drinks at 9pm to thank us for our patience. We show up at 9pm and are told that our reservation is for 9:30. No drinks offered. We wait, and wait, and wait. Finally after pitching a fit, we sit down for our meal at 10:20pm. <br><br>The food is OK but the service remained incredibly slow even though we had a set (and thus limited) menu. We finally left the restaurant at 1am tired, annoyed and involuntarily plastered. <br><br>The place is cozy and has a good atmosphere but they really need to get their act together on service. An apology would have been gratefully received but they really didn&#39;t seem to give a rat&#39;s ass.	0
This is a tough review to write because I used to be a regular at Marlow &amp; Sons years back and it was the life. The menu is quite the same in spirit, and the food quality is similar. I wont split hairs on the menu or the prices because that&#39;s a market/demand thing in my mind. I have to say, I love the very simple cooking, or lack thereof, and don&#39;t see why every restaurant with a literate chef can&#39;t serve food like this. <br><br>What&#39;s changed is the experience. The place, in it&#39;s popularity, has taken on some rude elements, the sophistication of which is below the pricepoint of the meal. A cultural problem is happening in this restaurant that is probably the fault of the floor manager and maybe the owners? The kitchen is still spot-on and almost deserving of the prices, but not if the service details don&#39;t work out. There are plenty of successful restaurants, wildly popular, that keep the front of their houses in check and keep a polite experience, despite the chaos of being a success. <br><br>I&#39;d rather a restaurant raise prices in response to popularity than resort to table turning tactics like loud fast post-punk music and other blatantly obvious tricks of the trade (that don&#39;t need mentioning to well seasoned new yorkers). We know undercurrents of disdain when we experience it in the details of the service. Marlow and Sons has turned into a business that&#39;s trending toward ruthless. It&#39;s still got 80% of it&#39;s hospitality machine working as it should, but 20% seaminess doesn&#39;t cut it for me at any price. Do not ever let on that a customer is just a dollar sign and drudgery; let it slip once and it&#39;s a disaster dinner, multiple times and it&#39;s a deal breaker. <br><br>Still, a good-looking crowd, though! Anyway, see you in the next life, Marlow, it&#39;s over.	0
Similan is by far our favorite Thai restaurant in Issaquah and one of our favorites in the greater Seattle area (and we frequent them a lot). The food is always fresh and tasty. My personal favorite on the menu is the Gingery dish with chicken.	1
My absolute favorite food in Madison. Layla is just amazing and her place couldn't be homier and better value for your money. If they served her food at L'Etoile, I'd be fine paying their prices for this quality food. Always amazing flavors and seasonings. I want to see her succeed even though it pains me to think her place will need to grow.	1
Man, I really wanted to like this place. I love the decor and it's also not too shabby to study there. The coffee isn't bad. This time I got a Chopped salad - I finally got it after being trolled into not getting it last time lol - and there were just too many things wrong with it. I don't think I will order food here anymore. Even the table next to me talked about how gross their smoked salmon tasted.. Just not fresh.The romaine was wilted and many of them had that cracked pinkish brown marks on the leaves. Some even had little tiny dots all over it (I dunno what caused this but the ones that were like that tasted gross). I had to eat some of it because I hadn't had dinner. But man, I seriously hate wilted romaine. It tastes so gross.The avocado was not fresh either. You know how when you leave avocado in the fridge for two long or you leave out for too long you get that brown stringy stuff and the color becomes yellowish? It was like that. I mean there's no harm in eating it but it sure didn't taste fresh. And the cherry tomato... There was maybe one cherry tomato cut into 4 pieces. Or maybe it might have been two cherry tomatoes. It was only on the edges of the plate. Sliced quarters laid on the edges as decorations. Don't bother saying that it has cherry tomatoes when you give me two of them lol.Is this as far as they can go with the price range? The price is sure lovely and reasonable but I wished I had gone to La Brea instead - while it may haven't been nice to my wallet, at least I would have had a better and fresh meal.	0
Me and boyfriend have been to this spot a couple of times...for dinner, for just drinks, and for brunch. Pimm's Cup is my favorite specialty cocktail. It's SOOO good- very fruity and easy to drink. Off the menu, the chile relleno is my favorite. I ordered the omelette and my boyfriend ordered the relleno...we ended up switching because I liked his so much more. Service is always great here too. Another plus- It's a busy environment at night so you can switch right from dinner to the bar which is nice - you don't have to run around hollywood finding the next spot to hang out for the night. Everything's right there in one place. I'd definitely recommend this place!	1
I used to like this place for its capuccino and chocolate croissant but the customer service is just terrible. They really dont care about the customer. I waited more than 30 mins for a bagel; and never got it.	0
Love, love, love this place! We had the old school pot, the kush (greens), and the BBQ veggies but what really blew my mind was the kimchi fried rice.. I could have eaten that bowl all my myself! So delicious! <br><br>The music was a tad loud which made it difficult for us to hear or have a deep conversation but the music was on point so we just chose to grub and chair dance. I love the laid back vibe. I love that you get a pitcher or light tea at your table too. <br><br>C&#39;mon, Roy choi doesn&#39;t disappoint .. He IS Los Angeles and I love it!	1
Oh my Happy Hour!	1
This DTLA gem is our go-to after a late night sports event or concert at Staples Center. Open 24/7, convenient parking right across the street, &#34;diverse&#34; patrons and good service from their long-standing waiters in their black ties. This place is Old School! The menu is hearty, comfort food and a bit heavy especially when eating late at night but it&#39;s not some place we go to that often anyway. Breakfast served all day and cash only.	1
Laredo's has been an old favorite for many years. We've been countless times, and the service is always good, and food excellent. The bottom line is that you can't beat the good food for the price. Sure, you'll find better Mexican places in other parts of the country, but this quite possibly could be the best Mexican food in town.	0
This place was dang good. We went there for lunch. They have a pretty great lunch deal of an appetizer, a glass of wine, and an entree for $19. We had the grilled artichoke, the grilled cheese adn tomato soup (which also comes with a side salad), and a glass of wine. The sandwich was ENORMOUS. It was honestly 2 sandwiches. The tomato soup was just okay, but the salad was good. Those artichokes were SO GOOD. And the artichokes themselves were good quality. I've had some wimpy ones lately, and these were DEF not that! Also, the staff here was really, really friendly. They were fast, attentive, but also kind of chill. I liked that! I didn't do dessert, but i wish i had because they have S'MORES!!!!!!!!!!!!!And the place was super cute inside, though we sat outside. It's LA... the weather is great!	1
Love LACMA, but hadn&#39;t been for a while. I will seriously come more often now because of Ray&#39;s/Stark&#39;s Bar. Such an upgrade from the old Patina. Friend and I hit the collections for a bit, then stopped for al fresco day cocktails and lunch. An AWESOME way to spend a day. <br><br>The cocktail menu is huge and amazing, if not somewhat overpriced. I had one of their seasonal cocktails, can&#39;t remember the name unfortunately, but it was fabulous. They were out of the next cocktail I wanted so the bartender whipped me up something specifically to go with dessert. Equally fabulous.<br><br>SQUID INK PASTA: Delicious. Flavorful. Not fishy in the slightest. I&#39;m a big fan of squid ink pasta and this was up there. Only thing was that there was perhaps a bit too much fresh mint, but I loved it nonetheless. If you like squid ink, it&#39;s a MUST ORDER. Actually, even if you aren&#39;t, it&#39;s worth trying. Friend I was with had never had squid ink pasta, and he really liked it. <br><br>SAGE PIZZA: AWESOME. If I had been more hungry, I&#39;d have devoured even more of this. Cheesy, savory, with Hen of the Woods mushrooms. Loved it. Will def. order again. <br><br>TOFFEE: It&#39;s Sticky Toffee Pudding. And it&#39;s excellent. I make a great one, so I&#39;m super picky when it comes to STP. This one was divine.<br><br>So glad summer is coming -- means I&#39;ll be back!	1
This is a better-than-average restaurant with a so-so view friendly service and decent food. It apparently has a loyal following which candidly I don't understand. At this price point there are better options in Seattle. Yes it's been here since 1950 and is part of Seattle's culinary history.	0
Tapas are phenomenal here! One of the few genuine Spaniard restaurants in Miami. The crema catalana is yummy!	1
Look, there&#39;s not a lot of complexity to The Apple Pan. You walk in the door, usually wait a few minutes for a spot at the counter, then sit down and eat. But this is a beautiful thing. What you&#39;re getting when you go inside is a handful of tasty handmade burger options served simply and with tremendous efficiency. Don&#39;t let that sound like faint praise, however, because this place is fantastic. Everything is wonderfully tasty, served in an atmosphere of 1940s/50s nostalgia. Get the hickory burger and a piece of pie--you won&#39;t be disappointed.	1
This place is a cute little place. The guacamole was great because the had cheese on it, although the bar was closed so I can&#39;t speak for the rest of the food. I got a intense drink that was well worth the money for a ten dollar cocktail.	1
One of my all time favorite places to eat. Not only is the venue warm and inviting but the food is as well! Everything tastes great from appetizers to entrees to dessert. The wine list is good and even their cocktail list blows most other los feliz&#39;s restaurants away. Every time I am in town I make a point to eat here.	1
So I arrive before my girlfriend and her friend.. I ordered a simple draft beer at the bar, since I was waiting. The beer was foaming so bad, it was taking two different guys to poor me one beer! It took forever to get a simple beer! The guy was nice and gave me more in my glass, after I made more room for beer instead of foam. This was a bad way to start my first time here, and was a sign of worse to come!Very bummed! The food looks good in photos.. there are many great reviews here. But it sucked! I had a starter of the warm Monterey squid salad. It was so sorry.. the squid pieces , when you could find any, were super thin slivers.. not rings or chunks.. slivers, almost paper thin little tiny pieces.. with vinager greens and cold potato 'filler'. Not even a squid salad.. I lived in Monterey Bay, and if they had even one whole small 5" squid sliced up in this salad.. it would have been ten times what this was..Then I ordered the pork plate, with pork belly.. Another very sad dish! The pork belly was a big square slab of fat, yes it was crispy on the ends.. but like a cube of pork fat! Gamey tasting as well.. the slices of pork medallions were dry and over cooked.. rubber like! Even though they took one meal off the bill, it was still over $150.00 for the three of us. Which is not a problem when the food is good!We will not be coming back.	0
I go there for lunch 3/26. The service is VERY bad,and restroom is VERY VERY DIRTY!! I don't know why "MICHELIN GUIDE RECOMMENDED" restroom so Dirty	0
Beermosa -- beer w OJ! 5 snaps up! Bananna nut muffin ginormous & meaty nuts 5*. Seemed like a local joint. Bar tender super cool & TV ran football so my date could watch the end. Never felt rushed. Small place but nice energy. Window seats so you can people watch who stumbles out of key lounge. Metered street parking that takes credit cards! 2$. Nice.	1
This used to be a favorite lunch spot of my co-workers and I. I have to be honest in saying the food is not amazing (especially in a city like LA), but the awesome location, decor, super friendly staff and inexpensive fare is reason enough to go again and again and again. As a vegetarian, I've not tried everything on the menu but I can stand by the nachos as a great choice (and think about adding a flight of Patron, especially if you're with a group)!I'm not sure if the $5 reward cards they gave us were because they were newly opened or because we went a lot, but ask about them -- couldn't hurt!I would highly recommend this spot if you're walking around in the Hollywood area and looking for a quick taco or nachos!	1
Alright, so I saw 3 reviews all with 5 stars and my office staff decided to try it. This place is like literally 5 minutes away and after reading the reviews I was convinced we had found our new lunch spot. First negative part about it, food was expensive!!! Ok I wouldn&#39;t have minded paying a bit more for Chinese food than usual if it was delicious but it was not that great. We tried the chicken wings, which were greasy and too big for my liking. The Schezuan beef was ok, so was the fried rice. Wonton soup was blah. My boyfriend wanted half of a fried chicken (it&#39;s a Jersey chinese food spot thing) they said ok we can do that with french fries for $12. Ok I ordered it, was not half of a chicken, it was the same order of chicken wings with like 1 extra piece, plus the fries were not good. The crab ragoons were horrible, stay away from them! For being a chinese restaurant not a &#34;fast food spot&#34;, Pei Wei is 95 times better- Hands down!!!!	0
Bottom Line - It's been a couple years since I've been here (and they were in a different location last time), but the food ended up being great, and the service just as good. I haven't been disappointed!	0
Great simple healthy food. Both vege wrap and grilled vege wrap were wonderful. Nice to have a vegan healthy place in the neighborhood.	1
Went there without any expectation.<br>A friend from New Jersey told me to come here and I did not even realize such restaurant existed even when I pass by it all the time.<br>Their milmyun was the bomb! especially during summer time it&#39;s a must to eat.<br>I was craving milmyun the next day I dined there.	1
This place was recommended to us by a friend and with being in the hotel we were staying it was close and convenient. There was plenty of space between tables and the place was very clean. Our server wasn&#39;t the friendliest (just asked for our order and asked if we were done and that was it). My husband got the Della&#39;s breakfast (french toast, bangers, scrambled eggs, and toast) and I got the omelet with an English muffin, a side of pumpkin pancake and fresh beet juice. The portions were big, filling, presented well, fresh, and delicious! I would recommend for a good, solid breakfast place!	1
This is not intended to be a food truck taco. These are superior ingredients cooked with professional techniques. The food is all delicious. The tacos are fantastic, the chicharonnes and potato skins (fries, really) are fantastic. The salads are solid. If you just come to try a Michelada, you may never leave. The Micheladas are worth a visit alone. I go all the time and everyone I've brought with me loves it. Try it for yourself.	1
This diner represents a past era of LA, kinda like the norman rockwell dinner plate scenes. The menu is definitely for the meat and potato crowd And the portions are large.<br>The place gets crowded during the weekend breakfast crowd and on any staple center event.<br>The reason for the norman rockwell reminder is one time i was at the counter and a grandmotherly type was next to me and then next to her was another stranger and when she left for the washroom the guy took care of her tab. When she got up to pay the waiter said don&#39;t worry that stranger picked up your tab	1
Well I called and asked for a reservation at 8-30. The lady said there was a table open now. I said I could not get there now and asked for 8-30. Again she said there was a table now and hung up. Perhaps this place is not very customer friendly. <br><br>That&#39;s the first time someone refused to give me a reservation..Quite amazing.	0
this place was supposed to be &#34;good&#34; &amp; we had high hopes for it. The latter is the reason why we decided to celebrate my friends birthday there - girls brunch, nice spot, good food. We thought we were set. <br><br>For starters, we sit &amp; some of our glasses (for water) are dirty &amp; had to request new ones. People setting the table should really pay more attention as this can gross a lot of people out before even ordering their food. Anyways, please note that none of the people in my party are picky eaters when it comes to ordering. However, some of my friends have religious/personal restrictions when it comes to meat. That was the case with one of the girls in our party. <br><br>The waiter comes around &amp; takes our order. My friend ordered the eggs your way plate but when it came to the potatoes &amp; the dish all she requested was &#34;no meat&#34; &amp; that was all - simple right? About 5 minutes or so later, the waiter comes around with my coffee (French pressed as default &amp; delicious!) &amp; an order of some ham and cheese croissants (we ordered 3 for $11 &amp; I highly recommend these!). But, I pretty much finished my entire press of coffee &amp; waited another 20 minutes after that (definitely more than 30 mins from time of ordering) before we saw any other food. So the food is finally coming out &amp; a few servers are helping out pass around the dishes. Sadly, the waiters had no idea what was what. They were pretty confused with the orders - but we tried to let it go given we were starving &amp; had waited so long for our food. They handed my &#34;no meat&#34; friend her plate &amp; when she asked if they were sure it had no meat, the waiter said he better go back &amp; check. So the waiter comes back &amp; we noticed he switched the potatoes to the ones WITH meat in them!!?! Umm, what? Long story short, the &#34;manager&#34; (an unprofessional person who was also playing hostess) comes over after my friend is now pretty upset &amp; tried to say that my fiend asked for the meat &amp; that the waiter was not at fault. All she ever requested was no meat! It&#39;s not rocket science. Especially after taking forever with our food, they still make us feel like we&#39;re a nuisance to the place &amp; blame my friend for the &#34;miscommunication&#34; - just wrong. An hour after initially ordering, she gets a new plate, which was boxed up &amp; eventually given to a homeless guy. Our party tried to make the best of the situation considering we were celebrating a birthday, but this place clearly shouldn&#39;t accept large reservations. They ruined the experience &amp; I doubt any of us will ever go back. <br><br>Thumbs up for the coffee &amp; croissants, but everything else was a huge thumbs down. Makes us sad because it was definitely not &#34;supposed&#34; to turn out this way given the restaurant&#39;s reputation...	0
I like it. It's got that what-a-cruel-world-let's- toss-ourselves-in-the-abyss type ambience. [A counter, stools, and chefs flippin' burgers. The end]Now I've seen a lot of bullshit... angel dust, switchblades, sexually perverse photography involving tennis rackets...[but these guys are serious about their burgers and pie]This isn't just a spoke in my menstrual cycle. [These burgers are fantastic!][Take a date!] It will be very. The [burgers] will give her shower-nozzle masturbation material for weeks.[Apple Pan] is God, let's go get a Slushie.	1
The Old Fashioned is the place I go when I am entertaining out-of-town guests, otherwise I tend to shy away from it (and most of the other establishments on the square). However, this past week, after dinner with some friends on the square, we decided to stop by The Old Fashioned to have a drink and to try the cheese curds (so that we could settle the old debate of who had the better cheese curds: Graze or The Old Fashioned?)	0
Terrible! I wish I had eaten at Safeco.	0
This place must have changed ownership since I last went as I don&#39;t understand all the positive reviews. Went years ago frequently UNTIL....on my way back to the restroom I saw a baby in diapers on a food prep surface! I was done.......	0
I recently visited The Capital Grille for Dine Out Boston and experienced a wonderful meal. I checked out their regular menu and it looked amazing. They have an extensive wine list, sold by full and half bottles as well as by the glass. Great place to enjoy fine dining. The feel of the restaurant is wonderful. The staff is very professional and polite. There cuts of meat are out of this world! Will defiantly come back for a special occasion with my husband!	1
It's right by the water taxi, which can be a fun way to get there. If not, there's parking around (although it can be difficult to find one during the weekend/summer). The view is awesome!	0
Have date night every week will be back again.... Nice restaurant and great service...	1
It&#39;s located on a side street near MLK which is kind of hard to find and limited parking. This is a very small restaurant so I wouldn&#39;t recommend planning to eat in here. I ordered the chicken and waffles which was very good. It&#39;s no Roscoe&#39;s but I enjoyed it. This is about one of the only places you will find to enjoy chicken and waffles in Las Vegas. I&#39;ll be back to try other things. It&#39;s a little too expensive to eat here on the regular. There was about a 20 minute wait for my food which is quite a bit but overall I was satisfied with my experience. Shoutout to whoever posted the picture of the fried catfish and fries plate because it looks super bomb. That&#39;s going to be my next purchase lol.	1
We were the first people in for brunch, but it took forever to get our food, and once it came, it wasn&#39;t hot. It tasted fine, though. <br><br>We split a Nutella crepe, but it didn&#39;t have Nutella. It was just Hershey&#39;s chocolate sauce. It would have been nice to know before we ordered. Maybe they just don&#39;t know what Nutella is? Or don&#39;t think that people can tell the difference?<br><br>Prices are pretty good for midtown. I don&#39;t think I&#39;d go back, though.	0
Now where did I park the car?	1
Checked out this place bc of all the good reviews. I&#39;m now wondering what the fuss was about. Garlic bread was bland and worse than what I buy at the grocery store. Pizza was okay; perfectly edible but nothing more. It was too soggy to be picked so I had to eat it with utensils. We only had pizza so I can&#39;t comment on the other menu items.	0
went here with my boyfriend for dine la. it was a really good price for what you get. it includes a drink - wine beer or lemonade. i got the fred 62 lemonade which is a mango citrus lemonade. really good and not too sweet. my boyfriend got the ipa they had on tap and he seemed to enjoy it. for appetizers, i picked the quinoa salad and he picked the mac n cheese bites. both of which were a lot larger than expected. i personally like food that is presented to me in large portions. they were both good though definitely something you could easily recreate at home. for the main course, i got the salmon with cheesy grits and he got the fried chicken and waffle dinner. the salmon for me was a bit more cooked than i usually like it but the grits were tasty. his fried chicken was delicious! the gravy was light and complimented the chicken and mashed potatoes. dessert is on its way! definitely should check this place out!	1
Very lucky!I thought, Highly rated Thai restaurant is right next to where I'm staying- bonus! ....now I'm curious. I thought I was the master of Thai restaurants. Is this how Thai food supposed to taste like??? Have I been fooled by other Thai places??? I'm really curious and I feel lost; about why this place has such a high rating.OH!Thai iced tea was really good by the way.But their food...I mean it's edible... but has something hard to explain about.The flavor... is.. just.. I don't know.... something's missing."I'm not sure... But you're not.. Thai!!!!!"So I don't think I'll go back. Bye :(	0
I didn't think the meal was spectacular but it was fast. I love the salsa and chips they put out and the at atmosphere is casual/enjoyable. I think in the evening, it sounds like a fun place but we came for lunch.	0
love this place...prices are steep but worth it!	1
I absolutely LOVE this place, their food tastes like home made goodness! They have a special of the day everyday that is a full meal for $5.75 and it also brings a soup!, It&#39;s definitely a steal.<br><br> I recommend you try their carne asada with tostones and ask for their chimichurri sauce on the side it is so TENDER and tasty you will be fully satisfied and your taste buds will love you! <br><br>Oh to drink they serve this drink called &#34;manzana&#34; which is basically a pink apple-flavored soda that tastes super delishh! Try it ;)	1
Went there at 1 am and they told me they did last call so that aren&#39;t open to 2 am.... We couldn&#39;t be seated. I can&#39;t say much more about it other than you have to find street parking if you don&#39;t want to pay for valet in an empty parking lot at ONE a.m.	0
If you have ever been to Tomasita's in Santa Fe, NM then DO NOT BOTHER GOING HERE. If you have lived in New Mexico and miss tender burritos packed with beans and swimming in a spicy vegetal gravy of savory green chile, then I repeat: don't bother.Because what you get is a soupy concoction of soggy tortilla wrapped around cheese and beans, covered in cheese, and surrounded by cheese. Even if you order extra green chile and NO CHEESE, they will still serve you a tortilla log in a greasy pool of cheese.The search continues.	0
****RAT ALERT**** Was just waiting for a table a saw a HUGE RAT running around! We all screamed and pointed and the workers just looked up like it was a normal tbibfb. GROSS! Contacting the health department STAT!	0
Very excited that it's opened in Highland Park! Very cute, reliable Italian food, great pizza and chic atmosphere. But I do think it's slightly over priced not because of the location but because of the quality of the food. If they could shave off a few bucks, I would think it's worth it. BTW- I'm no cheapskate, I base price on the quality of the food over location and reputation. I'd go back for sure - just not their #1 fan.	1
Amazing flavors, wonderful service, small ala carte portions but ended up being the perfect amount of food	1
Cute French place in Carroll Gardens. Menu is kind of limited, but we all ordered burgers on a brioche bun. Mine had brie and bacon and came with fries-delicious! The burger was thick, juicy and fresh! They have a little outdoor seating area, which is where we sat on that fine day. Our waiter had an accent, which made the restaurant have even more of a European feel. Yelp said it was a hot &amp; new restaurant in the area when we were looking for a place to eat and I&#39;m glad we went with it! The burger hit the spot!	1
Ugh.... We have been sitting here an hour and still no food!!! We only ordered some appetizers. I won&#39;t be back, that&#39;s for sure!	0
How dare you ruin my boyfriend&#39;s birthday dinner, Club A Steakhouse. ROARRRRR!!<br><br>I&#39;ve been planning his birthday for weeks now and wanted everything to be perfect. So I was so excited to come across all the positive reviews commending this place for their spectacular service and decided that this restaurant was &#34;the one.&#34; Boy.was.I.wrong.<br><br>The thing is, I&#39;m honestly not even that hard to please and it&#39;s very difficult to get me mad. Their service--or severe lack thereof-- was such a disgrace that my blood was boiling. They never came to check in on us, decided we didn&#39;t need water, and after apps they even decided we didn&#39;t need dinner. It took 40 minutes for the main course to show up. Fast forward through a whole undercooked then severely overcooked scenario and they actually brought out dessert with a candle and happy birthday written on the plate. <br><br>Cute gesture, if they didn&#39;t completely mess up the rest of the meal. That also means that they actually remembered that we were celebrating a special ocassion and STILL had the audacity to treat us like second class citizens. Unbelievable. <br><br>And I was prepared to drop some dough here too. You messed up real bad Club A, and I&#39;ll make sure to spread the word.	0
Gertude's at the Baltimore Museum of Art (BMA) is small but has very nice ambience. My party of three had a nice Easter Brunch there and it wasn't crowded and they even closed the restaurant from 3pm-5pm in order to not have over-crowding. I ordered a tasty mango mimosa and my daughter ordered a peach bellini. She also ordered the waffles which were divine! I ordered the crab omelette. It was ok; I've had better. The crab was good but the omelette tasted fake. My mom ordered the Maryland crab soup and a tuna sandwich (boring, I know!)  For dessert, my daughter and I shared a rather tasty Berger cookie cheesecake. Overall, it was a fun dining experience. They even had an Easter hat parade which was cool. I will return for brunch again.	0
I love the huge outdoor patio at this eatery.   The food is good and the service but just the ambiance, right in the middle of the little village at Towne Square is great. Parking is catch it if you get lucky, or walk from the rather distant parking garage. It's worth it, and the interior of the restaurant is very beautiful, too. Great choice  for any weather.	1
Yum yum grabbed a quick bite here before heading to the theatre down the block. Yum good tasty Blt or should I say "BLAT" very filling and tasty will definitely be back when I'm in the area :)	1
Loved our evening here.  The filet and sea bass were sublime.  Best Brussels sprouts I've ever had.	1
I have been coming to this restaurant for exactly 20 years on a regular basis! It is hands down a family favorite and is still my first choice over any other sushi joint. My daughter practically grew up in this place. Price wise it's pretty average for good sushi, but the sushi here is GREAT so price just isn't a concern for me when it comes to great quality. A party of 3 will easily cost more than $100 without blinking an eye, but that's eating the good stuff and a pint size Kirin beer. They have a cool cash rewards program that gives you $20 off after collecting 20 stamps on your cash reward card. You get one stamp for every $10 CASH you spend. You have to pay CASH to receive the stamps, it cannot be credit or debit card. Basically every third time I go I get $20 bucks off my bill, because like I said before, you easily drop more than $100 every time, especially with more than 2 people in your party. It may or may not be expensive for most Sushi lovers, but I highly recommend it! I've had the same sushi man for 20 years and the manager has never changed, and I know it's been there a lot longer than 20 years, so you will definitely be getting consistency!!! Plus it's located in the HEART of Little Tokyo, so it's always fun to check out the little shops after a damn good meal!! Lol!!!	1
Tasty but their version of a face meltingly hot vindaloo is more of a meh. Very tasty though and the service was fantastic.	1
The coffee and store itself were great. It's two floors and from the second floor you can look into a dance studio that's attached to the store. Interesting and the industrial concept is gorgeous. The low rating is because the employees were just that rude and inconsiderate. Work on training your employees in basic etiquette.	0
I went into PDs and sat down on a bench and watched and waited for a seat. Near the bar was half pitcher of some sort of liquid with liquid soaked napkins dripping on the floor. Sitting at the bar (for lack of a better word) were 3 guys in their black leather fags...dirty fingernails, greasy hair and bad beards. The place isn&#39;t well lit which is probably intentional. I took out a pie for reasons I stated above...the pizza tasted flat. It was similar to a frozen pizza. Location doesn&#39;t make a good place to eat, it&#39;s the best ingredients and know how of the people in the kitchen.	0
My friend who had brace wires from a fractured jaw brought me here because she couldn't chew so she enjoyed porridge at least.I'm glad i came with her. Abalone porridge was a nice serving size, very filling, and just decent.Very small space, has an authentic feel of korean mothers touch of home made meals.	1
This place serves a mean tuna melt. It&#39;s unbeatable. The cupcakes are very tasty. I also suggest the fruit salad. It can get crowded, so the goal is to get there before everyone else does. It&#39;s crowded and after you go there, you&#39;ll understand why.	1
I had an order of carnitas tacos, crispy steak tacos and an order of chicken quesadillas here. All were good, parts of the steak were too chewy to be consumed, but the majority was very good. Everything is made in front of you. Good place.	1
Great patio seating!<br><br>My breakfast looked like it belonged in a picture! So colorful and it taste just as good. Great little corner cafe off of 3rd with lots of outdoor seating. <br><br>Try the burrito with turkey bacon! Waitress recommended and so do I!	1
Best sandwich shop in BK? I think so. The bread they use is from some fancy bakery and I think the focaccia is made in-house. The fried chicken sandwich was amazing. All sauces/spreads are made from scratch. I got to taste the bacon jam, which normally comes with their to-go/delivery &#34;brunch box&#34; but they were cooking it up at the time I was there and got to taste it-DELICIOUS. I think it&#39;s also served with the egg salad sandwich.<br><br>These guys are legit. Way underpriced- get there before they realize.	1
Sloppy deliciousness.	1
The food is not that good which is an absolute bummer since the decor /ambiance is so rad. I didn't get all crazy and get gator bc that's something I'd never mess with if you offered me a trillion dollars, but the traditional cajun items like Hush Puppies and Po Boys were just meh.	0
I specifically sought out this eatery, because of my gluten/lactose intolerance. It was quite busy when I got there, about 1pm on a Monday afternoon. The seating is limited to the right side of the narrow entrance.<br>On arrival I noticed how cleanly the place is, and didn&#39;t house any greasy smells. Total plus. The man at the counter could tell by my bewildered look that I&#39;d never been there before and assisted me with the menu. He suggested the fish tacos, which I ordered. <br>2 really well made, soft tacos that are very satisfying to the taste buds. The fish was soft and just lightly battered, and there was a tangy chipotle sauce just drizzled over. Obviously made with care. <br>It&#39;s 4 not 5 bc of the cramped seating inside, and for the price I got 2 tacos, which was surprising. But definitely good fast eats.	1
Ate here last week while in town for Thanksgiving - my friend lives in the neighborhood and loves it - I could see why.People - it's a DINER, if you're expecting Foie Gras and a Reduction of Port Wine, go someplace else. I ordered Eggs In The Hole, and it was delicious. The hash browns were good (a little greasy, but still tasty). Bacon was thick cut and cooked perfectly. Love that they had Mr. Pibb available, especially since I was wearing my Mr. Pibb t-shirt! We closed out the deliciousness with shakes, mine was a coffee shake and it was perfect.	1
if i want to sum up my experience at this place with one word, it would be OVERRATED!they are booked for months for reservations and after waiting faithfully in line before they even opened for dinner, me and a group of about 9 people were seated. however, the waiter hurried our dinner and when we were still sitting after 2 hr, he told us we need to hurry up with our desserts because he needs to give the table to someone else. I understand these people are packed and in high demand, but pleasssse dont be rude to your patrons. the food was good, but nothing special, pizza is way better at delfina or pizzaiolo in oakland.	0
Celebrated my birthday dinner here. Great atmosphere and good food. I love that each dish is small and shareable, allowing the opportunity to try several dishes.	1
The next time I am scoring Horse on Skid Row I'll be sure to bring my pashmina so that I can cruise through C&S for a nice Cotes du Rhone and french onion soup. My dinner was delish but I thought that some dished lacked acidity. We had a tartine (which was like a pate) of Berkshire pork with prune compote. The contrast of sweet and salty was amazing but I couldn't really taste the pork. The onion tart had very small slivers of anchovy which I loved because you got all the flavor but never had to bite into an ugly slimy anchovy. There were also kalamata olives which surprisingly did not make the tart too salty. (Note - the tart is huge; bring it home and heat in the oven to re-crisp and top with a lightly dressed mixed green salad!) The bouillabaisse that Irene raved about in her LAT review was not as flavorful as she made it sound. The broth had no splash of flavor. It was intended that you add croutons dipped in a garlic aioli into the broth after eating the fish out but this ruined the texture of the liquid with chunks curdled aioli floating around. I felt like the broth should be flavorful on its own. Be sure to have dessert and/ or a cheese course, they bring a rustic wooden board to your table for you to select. Also, their baguette is divine! I wanted more of that for dessert. (its from breadbar). And lastly, service is excellent - knowledgeable, friendly, attentive, yet casual.	1
meh.<br><br>was excited after all the great reviews!<br><br>i got the steak sandwich. good sized. but not much flavor. bread was chewy and a little stale.<br><br>my wife got the cole turkey. it sure tasted good! she was nauseated the rest of the night, which was no fun. dont know if the coleslaw or russian dressing was spoiled. or maybe the turkey.<br><br>customer service terrible. we got there around 5p. they were nearly out of all the various bread choices. the folks working there really didnt know what the were doing. one customer wanted a steak sandwich, but they were out of rolls. he asked if they could do it on regular bread. AND THEY SAID NO! seriously? take the steak, put it between two slices of bread, and get the guy a steak sandwich! wow. <br><br>here is the box. no one behind the counter could get outside of the box.<br><br>i wouldn&#39;t go back. sorry.	0
The people from Radio Bar on South Beach bring us their new pop up bar Better Days right in the heart of Brickell. A fun, hassle free vibe with little touches that I like such as: free pool table, fruit infused water, their signature trait popcorn, and yummy well priced cocktails and beer. Free cover just walk right in. Very laid back yet hip. I came on a weeknight so not familiar with the weekend crowd. Check them out!	1
Definitely one of the best new Mediterranean food joints in the area. I&#39;m pretty picky about my Mediterranean food, but their falafel sandwich rocked my world! I added some of their pickled mango sauce and mini pickles....crispy falafel goodness all wrapped in their homemade pita bread.. deeeeeeelicious!	1
Petee&#39;s just opened this month and I&#39;d be hard pressed to find a reason not to give them 5 stars. I suppose if you&#39;re buying a full pie the price is pretty steep but for stopping by for a slice, $5 is a reasonable price. The girl who helped me was incredibly friendly and sincere and the whole little shop really gives off a great vibe. There&#39;s only a counter with a few stools but I&#39;d imagine most of their business is to-go. I like that the entire business is open so you can see all the magic happen, and make no mistake, magic is happening here. The pie flavors rotate with the season (I&#39;m assuming) and to some extent, the day. I tried a slice of their already famous chocolate chess pie as well as a slice of the apple cranberry. The chocolate chess was basically like slightly more firm brownie batter in a pie form. It was amazing and not too sweet or rich, it was the perfect balance of sweetness and chocolate flavor and texture. The apple cranberry pie was also perfect, possibly the best I&#39;ve ever had. The crust was perfectly flakey and buttery without being too dry or too much. The apples were the perfect combination middle ground of firm and soft while there was no goopey canned gel type stuff you sometimes get with apple pie. There weren&#39;t many cranberries, just enough to give the occassional tart note. I can&#39;t wait to come back and try all of their traditional and non-traditional pie options. Petee&#39;s is definitely going to make keeping my new years resolution challenging because I want to do nothing in moderation when it comes to pie.	1
Came in the other day from a recommendation of a good friend- I was really excited upon entering- the vibe is extremely chill and inviting, with an awesome opened space and killer artwork. I tried a bunch of things... some highlights included, the pork buns, brussels sprouts and this heavenly piggy banh mi. Well done, you guys!	1
My friend and I wanted a quick bite after our Griffith Park hike, so we stopped in here. We ordered some tasty alcoholic beverages, which came out in HUGE diner glasses!! Score! We also ordered nachos, which were the coolest nachos I've ever had. All the toppings were piled on each individual chip! There was no digging into a mound of mush, no nasty, sloppy fingers, no soggy chips left at the bottom with no toppings. I am absolutely going to make nachos like this for my next party. SO SMART! We also got a cobb salad, which came out looking like ceviche, all neatly piled up on itself in a square. Equally delicious.	1
Pizza was delicious and light. Not greasy and heavy like other chain pizzas. We ordered the fourth horseman which they give you an option of ranch base or marinara (we chose marinara base). The pizza was delicious, the crust had herbs mixed in which gave it a great taste. I usually skip eating pizza crust but this pizza had me wolfing down mine! <br><br>My nephew had ordered a calzone with his choice of two toppings. He got pepperoni and italian sausage which was a bit spicy, what a great indication of the quality. <br><br>Also the root beer floats are served in a chilled mug and were darn good. All for $3, this totally beats Johnnie Rockets! This place is located in front the metro gold line, easy to get to. The only bummer is the parking, they only have a few (I think less than 5) spots and they fill up pretty quickly.	1
food was great , but the service was over the top. first class, everyone made you rite at home.and was very friendly.	1
Great ambiance and vibe. Very cool hotel and beautiful, breezy restaurant. Our waitress was actually the best I've ever had, and as a former waitress and chronic patron that title doesn't come lightly. I wish I remembered her name, but to the smallish, brunette zany girl: You deserve a raise.I'll certainly come back to Commissary, but the main reason will be the overall experience not specifically the food. I enjoyed my fries (but nothing too special there) and the eggplant was good but too spicy for my taste. Alos, call me basic, but the picture ordering freaked me out too.. I like when I know what's in the food I order without having to ask about every single one.	1
Food&#39;s awesome. Understand it&#39;s busy. No need to be a douche on the phone. I get it, you&#39;re busy. Sucks when a chill place gets pretentious.	0
We moved close to KTown over a year ago and have been eating our way through every Korean soup and noodle joint KTown has to offer ever since. This is definitely one of the tops on our list.They've got all the random beef parts that my husband loves to eat and I have grown to love as well. Their oxtail soup is very tasty and perfect when we're too lazy to make it at home. As a soup maker at home, we know how hard it is to create a clear broth full of flavor, the mark of a well crafted soup. It requires parboiling, cleaning the bones thoroughly, and them simmering slowly on low heat for hours to achieve perfectly clear broth. Don't forget you have to strain it too! It takes hard work!	1
I had a bill last night for 20 dollars which I put on my credit card. We left a cash tip, so my card should have been charged for 20. But this morning when looking at my online statement, it shows that I was charged 24 dollars. Listen, I&#39;m not one to complain about 4 dollars, but that is straight theft. We left the waitress over 20 percent in cash, so there was no need to put extra tip on my credit card. She was a female waitress probably in her late 20s, with dark hair and bangs. I will be calling the restaurant today to let them know about this.	0
Being half Honduran, I grew up with the wonderful food of my father&#39;s homeland. I remember my two aunts in the kitchen making tortillas and re-fried beans from scratch while the excitement built up inside of me. It was time for baleadas, a sacred right, and Paseo Catracho is the closest I&#39;ve ever come to re-experiencing that feeling since my childhood.<br><br>For the uninitiated, a baleada is a thick, oversized, handmade flour tortilla which is filled with refried beans, crumbled cheese and cream then folded in half. This is the simple version. You can also add carne asada, eggs, chorizo, or all of the above for a super baleada. My favorite is with carne asada.<br><br>The dishes at Paseo are delicious and very authentic. Their sampler is excellent and, frankly, underpriced for the quality and quantity of food you get. It comes with chips in bean dip with melted cheese, two flautas (rolled, deep fried tacos), carne asada, cerdo asado (pork), three mini pupusas, and half of a stuffed sweet plantain (stuffed with refried beans and cheese.) It will easily feed four people without a main dish. If you still have room go for a baleada. Wait, eat one even if you don&#39;t have room! Stuff your face! Or just take one to go. They&#39;re excellent. Besides the baleadas, the pork is mouthwatering and definitely worth trying.<br><br>Not five stars?<br><br>I&#39;ve been to this restaurant twice and both times had an issue with the service. It took way too long for the server to bring us the check and even longer to bring my card back with the receipt for me to sign. This might seem petty to some, but I can&#39;t stand it. On the second visit my sister&#39;s order was never placed and by the time she finally received her food the rest of us were done eating. Despite these inconveniences, I will definitely keep going back. Give it a try. <br><br>Now!	1
This place has the worst service. The waitresses there are rude. They always look like they&#39;re mad at you and they don&#39;t acknowledge you from the moment you step into the restaurant. I&#39;ve eaten there and gotten take out from here a few takes and each time was unpleasant. I usually go there when I&#39;m sick and want comfort soup and you especially don&#39;t want to deal with rudeness when your sick. I&#39;ve only went back and gave this place 2 stars instead of one because the food is good. Pretty fed up of feeling unwelcome there. I will not be returning anymore. There is a Buil Samgye Tang on 3rd St that taste the same with much MUCH better service.	0
Went for hibachi with my gf. It was my second time going to Osaka. First time was amazing. This time we had a really poor hibachi chef. He wasn't as entertaining as I hoped he'd be. Was really messy and rice was flying around. It was also very crowded and they may have been under staffed so probably a hit or miss when you go. Definitely make a reservation though, although even if you don't the max wait time is 5-10mins. Not bad at all.	1
I was so excited to try this place out given the reviews I saw on yelp, and I had to say I was disappointed in the food. <br><br>My girlfriends and I ordered the &#34;Mac and Cheese&#34; &#34;Corn Bread&#34; &#34;Fried Green Tomatoes with Pimento&#34; &#34;Maple Bacon Donut&#34; and of course the &#34;Fried Chicken&#34;<br><br>The Mac and cheese was nothing spectacular, and I always order a Mac and cheese to try out in every resturant I go to. My top places for that is Table 34 and Yard House! Yumm yumm<br><br>The Corn Bread had real corn kernels inside the bread with a lime zest whipped butter. The Kernels were rubbery. Didn&#39;t taste fresh.<br><br>Fried green tomatoes with pimento and bacon need some acidity to the plate. So I added a squeeze of lemon wedge and it tasted better.<br><br>The Maple Bacon Donut, ohh so sad.. It was so Doughy and not enough glaze and bacon for the whole donut. We all had one bite and left the other half. They should make 3 mini donuts instead of one large one.<br><br>I saved the best for last! The Fried Chicken is definitely the Star on the Menu from our order. Juicy great flavor and breading! It is yummy!!	0
Located in the former Salad &amp; Co. location. Sandwiches here are fresh and their Boba tea is also yummy. My fave is the jasmine green tea and Maggie&#39;s club. I order or pick up from them often and wait time varies if they are very busy. At times, Ive waited up to an hour for delivery. If you are in the area, check them out.	1
I just found my favorite Italian restaurant! Great pizza just like in Italy with crust perfected!<br><br>Their eggplant parmagiana was also different. Although the eggplant was super soft, the mozzarella cheese in between was chewy and I think they cooked it with their own fresh tomatoes. There were tomato peels here and there.<br><br>Nice accommodating staff though. We shall return!	1
Excellent service from Autumn. Unique dishes that can't be found on every corner of town, such as delicious beef patties and yuca.	1
LOVE THIS PLACE. Lots of great casseroles and great vegetarian options. Everything from the mac and cheese to the vegetarian pot pie is amazing. Absolutely love this place...Spread the word, people!	1
Went a few weeks ago for dinner with friends before attending a play at a local theatre in the area. I had the Ahi Tuna sandwich and enjoyed it, very tasty and followed it up with a delish brownie with NUTS - yayyyyy - I know that more and more people are allergic to everything and I feel like those of us who are not allergic to nuts suffer so thank you Toast for making brownies that include more than lots of chocolate and nothing else.<br>Decided to give this place another try and this time, had breakfast this morning and it was just okay.......had the salmon and cream cheese egg white omelet and the salmon was overcooked and the two blocks of cream cheese jammed into the omelet did not melt and just sat their awkwardly staring back at me, so I removed it and sat it to the side. <br>Will not order that again but the banana nut muffin was good but the highlight of my day was when I saw Magic Johnson and his lovely wife pull up a table right behind ours.	1
I may have messed up my taste buds for korean fried chicken in New York comparable to K-town LA's korean fried chicken, cause this was very mediocre.Overcooked & too much batter where it ripped and cut up the inside and roof of my mouth. The spicy hot wings were good. The blend of sweet spicy was missing something, but I still ate it, just couldn't figure out what it was missing. Got Honey Wings, Garlic Soy and original. They all tasted the same. I think their variety of flavors weren't really a variety, they all kind of tasted the same with the exception of more batter piled on. The salad was very bland.Eh. I think it is all just hype for being the most popular fried chicken in k-town, but there are always better ones.	0
This is a great restaurant that blends an intimate feel with top notch food and drink. The staff are friendly and knowledgable about their dishes. There is great flavor and excellent presentation. I will definitely be a regular here.	0
Great bar to grab a drink and hang out with friends. I love that the entrance is on the side and you have to walk down a small alley to get to the patio area. Lights are strewn across providing a nice ambiance. When the weather is nice, it&#39;s fun to sit outside under these lights and chat with friends. Drinks are reasonable and it&#39;s fairly easy to get your order in. One night we weren&#39;t able to go inside since they had a private event going on, but it&#39;s all good, hanging outside is way more fun anyway!<br><br>All these Yelp reviews are talking about food, and I really need to get my butt back here to try some wasabi fries! AHHHH!	1
Went on a date. Menu looked great (farm to table ish) but everything was a little disappointing. Way too expensive for what it is.	0
Grubstake... Grubstake... Grubstake? Man, it seems like every single time I party with my buddies in the city, they take me to Grubstake at the end of the night. I've been several times and for some odd reason I haven't written a review on this place. Oh wait, I know why. It's because it's not that great and I usually forget about it the next morning for two reasons. 1) I was really drunk the night before and 2) Some of the food is borderline atrocious. Without getting into too much detail, I have to admit that I am a fan of their potato skins and link sausages. These two items make perfect drunk food. The potato skins are loaded with a ton of cheese, bacon and sour cream. They're greasy and heavy - a perfect way to help tame your hangover the next morning. The link sausages are pretty good too - nice flavor, great snap to them and a tiny bit of heat. With the positives behind me, I HAVE TO talk about the negatives. Never in my life... and I mean NEVER IN MY LIFE have I had wings as terrible as the ones at Grubstake. They call them Portugese Buffalo Wings, however, I kept calling them Bush League Buffalo Sh*t. I can't believe they have the nerve to keep this on their menu. The wings have absolutely terrible flavor. I have no idea what kind of rendition of "buffalo wings" these are because they taste like, well, sh*t. The worst part isn't even the flavor, it's the texture - dry and grainy. So disgusting and fowl. I'm pretty sure these wings suffered from major freezer burns. What pissed me off the most was that when we asked the server if their wings were any good, without hesitation he said they were "excellent". GET IT TOGETHER MAN!!!Some of the other not-so-great dishes include their terrible sauteed shrimp with garlic, the oil injected onion rings and their horrendous cream cheese poppers. What really gets me thinking is how much worse the food would taste if I actually had the balls to eat at Grubstake sober. I'm pretty sure if I did I'd end up being underwhelmed by the potato skins and link sausages! The only reason I didn't knock their rating down to 1 star is because, well, me being drunk every time saved their @ss. Let's not kid ourselves, food taste better when you're drunk. It's not a secret! I seriously think the peeps at Grubstake opened the place just to serve sh*tty food to drunk people. They were probably like "Hey, I have a great idea. Let's open a restaurant and serve bad food to the drunk and disorderly. They'll eat anything!"... ... well, that's partially true.	0
The service is terrible and the owner is a dick. Food taste good but extremely over priced and they don&#39;t serve enough on a plate.<br><br>If your the type of person who eats more than a mouse and don&#39;t like to be talked down to, then stay away from this restaurant.	0
Short rib hash is DELICIOUS! Ask for Candice, she'll navigate you through the menu! Honestly I think more like a 4.5.	1
Wow - it's literally like walking off the streets of LA and into a fancy french bistro with an NYC vibe. You almost get a feeling like you're outside - it might be the hanging lights and cobbled floors, but the mood is right for a romantic date - or a night out with friends who enjoy the finer cuisine.The wine selection was all French - and that's not a bad thing! My two friends and I had a hard time choosing but ended up with amazing short rib, cassoulet and bouillabaisse! And of course we had to have an oyster sampler to start with...They also have great cocktails..	1
I love this spot. Their cassava cake is soooo good. I love how friendly both the server and owner are. Not a scene, just a quality coffee shop with pleasant service!! Very reasonable pricing as well. Thank baby jesus for this spot.	1
Super impressed with the speedy delivery. I ordered and my food arrived in 20 minutes. Amazing. I would give it five stars but my sandwich is cold so I&#39;m assuming this was premade :/ <br><br>Thanks though!	1
Best martinis in Madison. Tasty drinks (beer choices for those more inclined) -try the Butter Up Kim for a martini.	0
The service here was just not good. One male bartender was nice to some of patrons, but the rest of the staff was just plain rude and inattentive. The food took forever, and I imagine it would have actually been delicious (reason for two stars instead of one) if it was brought out hot instead of room temperature. The place would actually be a great neighborhood gem if they just had staff that card anything about customer service. Side note... They do not take credit cards.	0
Arby's, your days are numbered. Curly fries, cooked in beef fat! Also, the beef here is tender, and the rolls are perfect. To add to this, there's also frozen custard!I will update more, after my excitement subsides!	1
So delicious! Wonderful vibe! Great for a date or a brunch. The burrata salad was joy to my tastebuds. I also thought the proportions were generous and the pricing totally fair. The food was just great. I wanted to try everything- a great menu. Brahm, server there, was RIGHT ON with his recommendations. I can't wait to come back!	1
This place was a gem. Awesome menu, fresh food, light, flavorful and low fuss. I loved that you could eat there (2 outside tables) or take it to go - a sweet deal especially if you're staying at the Holiday Inn across the street.  All the dishes we got were top quality - the sides were awesome - especially the berry-wheat salad (it was an eye opener for us). When done eating, we were stuffed, had left overs, and didn't feel heavy or bloated.	1
I can&#39;t get enough of this place. The waitstaff is super friendly, the food is amazing (arepas de choclo are okay, but their cheese ones are to die for), and the ambiance is super casual/non pretentious.<br><br>Need more evidence of its greatness? I&#39;ve seen myself coming out of way down Brooklyn or the Bronx more than once just to have their arepas. Look, places like Caracas in Wburg/East Village have good offerings.... But the no-nonsense, non-pretentious, out-of-the ordinary feel that this place provides (plus the quality, which is far superior) is a killer.	1
We arrived about 10 minutes late, my fault for underestimating traffic on a Saturday night and getting into the mall. I apologized when we came in at the hostess station and we were shown to a table that was closer to the food prep area and a bit separate from the dining room. We asked if we could be seated in the dining room area, there were a few open tables, and the person who had walked us to our table went back to the hostess station to see about changing our table, we followed and overheard the hostess respond to the request with &quot;what do they expect, they were late&quot;. It was not what was said so much as the tone which it was spoken. While where we were seated was very loud and we looked out into the mall, the upside, our server was incredibly pleasant and patient of my friend's dietary restrictions and questions. The food was excellent and service was quick and professional. We will most likely return at some point, the proximity is very convenient when you are shopping or going to a movie. I will make sure to request a table in the dining area next time and hold out for this.	1
I&#39;ve been to this restaurant a few times, and if I had thought to review them then, it would&#39;ve been 4-5 stars EASY. Today was the biggest disappointment. I had family from out of town, they were looking for a good veggie burger, and I knew this would be the place. <br>When we were seated we were given the brunch menu, which is fine, it is a Sunday. I asked if there was any way a veggie burger could be an option, our server &#34;Kyle&#34; declined. He should&#39;ve stopped there, but he went on to recommend a Lobster BLT. First of all Kyle, Lobster is a crustacean, second of all the B in BLT stands for Bacon, neither of these two foods are part of a VEGETARIAN diet. Granted this is a burger joint, and most people just assume all burger lovers want a meat option. <br><br>The dilemma only continued, it took about 15 minutes for our drinks to arrive, which were great. We then received ice cold hockey puck biscuits, now as a Southern girl I do consider myself a biscuit connoisseur of some sort... the biscuit was great, but would&#39;ve been all the more better had it been hot, and had it steamed a little as I cut into it, but, no, no steam, just a cold biscuit. 45 minutes after our order had been placed, a group of people sat opposite to us, as they did, Kyle let us know that our food was coming out in a just a minute, in fact he had seen it in the window. Now Kyle, since you had been able to SEE our food in the window WHY did you not carry it out to us? <br>Well, 20 minutes after Kyle had let us know our food was on the way out, still no food, some man, I assume the manager, came out to let us know that they were out of bagels, and would a burger bun suffice? After this man offered, the table that had been sat 20 minutes ago received their piping hot food.<br><br>Now, let me review all that has happened with us, 15 minutes for a drink, 45 minutes from that drink being on the table for our server to say our food is on the way, 20 minutes after that someone comes to tell us one of our orders is no longer available. <br><br>Thankfully, I come from a family of optimists, and although we were clearly perturbed by this entire experience, we continued to try and make the best of it, even by creating a vegetarian meal out of a toasted burger bun, lettuce, and a tomato. <br>Over all the rest of the meal was enjoyable, like I said, I&#39;ve been here a few times and have always left a happy customer, unfortunately today was not the case. <br><br>As a former server, when I dine out, I expect to receive the level of service I gave people, which at the end of the day, is kind attention, without being overly invasive to the enjoyment of their meal. However, I would never allow someone to sit and wait 45 minutes for food, I would not tell them their food is coming right out, only to have them wait another 20 minutes. Meanwhile some other table that has been there only for 15 minutes receives drinks and food. I also would not tell you your food is coming out, only to be followed by someone saying no, it&#39;s no longer available. 1 hour and 5 minutes to say it&#39;s no longer available is UNACCEPTABLE. I&#39;ll also say, as a former server I know, that when the items are below 10, a little number pops up, to let the server know this is limited. If our order went in, no problem, then that bagel should have been ours. I imagine somewhere in the hustle bustle of the kitchen someone nabbed the bagel. Which fine, it happens, I get it, and it&#39;s not always in the control of the server, however, you should have a better alternative to offer than a hamburger bun. Unless it&#39;s a hand crafted Kaiser roll, I don&#39;t imagine most people go out craving to eat a hamburger bun.<br><br>I think it&#39;ll be a while until I return here, as this was pretty disappointing...<br><br>Also, for Kyle, a lesson on what it means to be a vegetarian. Vegetarians eat vegetables; some vegetarians eat eggs, and dairy products. Vegetables grow from the earth; they do not walk, or have eyeballs, or any sort of organs. Pescetarians are people who classify themselves as vegetarians, but also eat some fish. Now, Kyle, if we say, &#34;I&#39;m a vegetarian, there&#39;s no way I can get a veggie burger?&#34; If the answer is no, just say no, don&#39;t offer me a sandwich with both a crustacean and pork. <br><br>You were lucky we&#39;re kind individuals who have all spent time in the server industry. We left you a 30% tip, which I will flat out say, was NOT my idea, nor the idea of the man who ended up with a hamburger bun as a meal, I think you deserved way less than 20% or even 18%	0
This is going to be my new favorite place in the neighborhood. There&#39;s precious little that stands out on this stretch of Hollywood Blvd so when the crappy Thai place shut down and the signs went up for Ramen I was hopeful. And it was like mana from heaven. The food shows way more attention to detail than the interior decor does (avoid the temptation to act out weatherman jokes against the key green walls) and is done perfectly. I had the shio butter broth ramen and it was so good I was practically mad at it for being so damn delicious. All smiles for service, eager to get the word out, and an almost shockingly modest price. Most restaurants fail in the first year, this place deserves to be a hit, and maybe they can re-paint the walls and put that tiny soundboard I saw in the corner to some use.	1
Dined at Bazaar Meat last night . Service was very slow!! The food took forever to get!! Even the wine glass and  gazpacho shot!! Mostly ate uncooked food - so it just doesn't make sense to wait for so long !!!! Power went off around 9:40 pm so for about 15-25 min we set in the dark.. Got the steak we ordered prior to the power failure an hour later. No compensation offered , only one short very insufficient not honest apology from our patronizing server...   Very bad experience overall.. Not worth the money would not recommend to anyone.	0
One of the best Thai restaurant taste wise I've been... I am always a fan of their shrimp fried rice and bbq beef skewers especially with the peanut sauce. Also, the beef panang, it's delicious.Yet, service is a little bad due to the lack of staff, too noisy since mostly large group comes in here as well as large families. Otherwise, food meets great value.... I will always come back on this place.	1
This is still one of my favorite steaks ever. I love nice steakhouses (ie, Mortons, craftsteak, etc), but this is still one of my favorite places of all time. I dnt know what it is...maybe its just that they cook my steak perfectly every time and there is little seasoning beyond the 80 years of goodness on the griddle. And where else can you get a good sized NY steak for less than $20?I always go late night after Dodgers games or concerts at Nokia, so Ive never had to wait in line. I dont live in LA, so weekday breakfast isnt really an option. Ive heard good things about breakfast, but never had a chance to experience it.I also love the whole experience. You walk in and the place just looks kinda dumpy and old school, but then you are greeted by elderly gentlemen in vests and bow-ties that have probably worked here their whole lives. I dont know, the history and atmosphere just add to the the experience.So yeah, if people come here expecting fine dining, they will be disappointed, but if you just want a good, old-fashioned home style meal for a good price, youre in the right place...	1
Good food. Will definitely come back. The only thing bad I can say is that the servers like to chat with regulars in the dining room and we pretty much heard everyone's life stories.	1
If you feel like overspending on chicken wings that are mediocre in flavor, then go ahead. This place lacks value and especially Customer Service. I had so many complaints from my friends about this place. You are paying for the branding, not the food. Everything is pretty much ala carte and have to pay for it separately even the side radishes. There are so many other chicken wing restaurants around so check them out instead.	0
Snobs and bad communicators. Myself and the Mrs. went there for a pleasant Sunday brunch, only to be told that they only take reservations, or accept guests of the hotel. This, despite the many clearly empty tables in prime brunch time (a little after 12), and the complete lack of notification until we got there. Seriously, is it so hard to post a policy on the restaurant&#39;s web site? The only indication is the reservation selector on their home page... but at no point do they say that booking is REQUIRED. So it was a wasted trip for nothing. Instead, we spent our money at one of the many local competing restaurants that actually seemed GRATEFUL for our business. This roof might have a nice view, but that&#39;s not worth dealing with snobby people who think this can paper over bad management. Find somewhere else in this neighborhood to eat; there are plenty of good places that actually WELCOME your business.	0
Five stars for the cocktails (anything with fruit and herbs and insanely fragrant cucumber that&#39;s properly mixed on a summer day gets 5 stars from me) and 3 stars for the food. I had the margharita pizza and it was good--nice crust and tasty sauce--but nothing extraordinary. It is, however, a fantastic place to sit outside and enjoy the day after seeing some great art.	1
So many flies!!! We were being attacked from all angles, it was a real turn off!<br><br>The wait staff is fine, nothing to note either way.<br><br>The brunch menu is small but satisfying - I personally recommend the eggs with potato gratin. But the rest of the menu is supposed to be &#39;Asian influenced.&#39; It was more Asian than French cafe.<br><br>Also I hate little hole in the wall places that are cash only with no bank anywhere near them. $5 ATM fees are not cool!	0
We had two appetizers and split the lamb shank, plus desert.  Just right, and if you come early it is quiet.  A good start for a pleasant evening.	1
The WORST Mexican restaurant I&#39;ve ever been to. Terrible service (waited over an hour for our food) and even worse food. They sell &#34;margaritas&#34; that are wine based and have no tequila. The drink was watered down, full of ice and 8 dollars with no tequila. The atmosphere was like a high school cafeteria. Probably the worst Mexican restaurant in Miami. I guess they have family and friends posting yelp reviews. All around awful experience.	0
Called ahead to get reservations for a birthday and asked about dessert option presentation for a birthday.They told me they had a metal cake.With fireworks coming out of it.What is this...Luna Park has a great intimate and fun feel to it. I got the Volcano Scorpion bowl and a warm chocolate cake with chocolate ice cream.Working out with the hostess on how to sneak in the surprise cake was fun. The people were very nice and attentive, with great attention to detail. When the cake came out, it looked gloriously scary - in the best way possible.Didn't have the chance to try their other food though, just had dessert and drinks.The chocolate cake was so soft and warm - the perfect bite with some ice cream on it. The scorpion bowl was big, with a shot light on fire upon presentation. Strong and sweet drink. Could have finished it, but had to drive safely.AND - after all this trouble, they took my expired Living Social coupon! I asked about it and they said that they don't believe in the expiration dates. AWESOME!Great service. Fun people. Romantic atmosphere. metered and valet parking.	1
I was excited to try Vinegar Hill House as I like Freeman&#39;s food but I don&#39;t love the attitude. I thought a Brooklyn version would be an improvement, but sadly I was wrong.<br><br>We ordered a bottle of wine at the bar and were brought a different bottle. When we said it wasn&#39;t correct, the bartender questioned us before determining that it was in fact not the bottle we ordered.<br><br>Once we were seated at a table the waiter greeted us with a &#34;sup?&#34; and then asked what kind of water we wanted--but didn&#39;t bring us water until our meals arrived 30 minutes later, even though we requested it three times. <br><br>The food was good (excellent charcuterie plate), though the chicken was not entirely cooked. When the waiter saw I was examining the uncooked chicken, he walked away. He never checked back to see how our meal was. <br><br>The restaurant is located on a really pretty street in Brooklyn and the atmosphere is nice, but the service was terrible. I think you can find similar food in Brooklyn without having to put up with the terrible service and attitude. When is the too cool for school vibe going to die?	0
I probably should have researched this place before going because it was not at all what I expected. To be clear: Diablo Tacos is NOT Mexican food. It's an experimental, creative interpretation of Mexican food -- which is totally fine, except for the fact that all of the dishes we ordered were a huge disappointment.There were only about three taco options. I ordered the "fried chicken" taco and my friends ordered the pork belly taco which had some creative ingredients like banana and thai sauce that scared me away.The fried chicken taco was just ill-conceived. Fried chicken is great standalone. You don't need to wrap it in a corn tortilla and sprinkle lettuce on it. As for the pork belly, my friends were very displeased; and they are the types to get into weird, experimental food.I also ordered a "salad" which basically consisted of large chunks of radish, slivers of cucumber, and a few pieces of jicama doused in the most unbearably spicy and sour chili lime sauce (worse than Tobasco). I could only get halfway through the salad, until I decided to just rinse the vegetables in my glass of water, so that they could actually be edible and not gag-inducing.Then I went home and ordered a pizza.	0
Mmmmm.....Soup = OkNoodle = not a Japanese noodleEgg = "half boiled egg" is misleading... When Japanese hear it, we think it's "half-boiled, egg". not "half of the boiled egg". since Ramen HAS TO HAVE half-boiled egg, it's kinda fail.Menma (bamboo shoot) = It's a Chinese one, but since Chinese makes menma far better than Japanese, I guess it's ok like that.Red Ginger = I ordered Tonkotsu. Tonkotsu has to come with BUTTLOAD of red ginger. NOT two shreds It's not a (ok kind of but oh well) rocket science to make a good (not great) Ramen... why none of the restaurants in San Francisco does it "good?"As for OkonomiyakiCabbage = WTF? 70% of the okonomiyaki has to be composed with Cabbages. it's not an expensive material.. why so little of it?Red Ginger = It should be in the dough. Nori on the top = it's not necessary Mayo = more pleaseOkonomiyaki sauce = more pleaseBonito on the top = more pleaseAo Nori on the top = more pleasePork = Okonomiyaki SHOULD BE based on thin sliced pork or beef.. that's the basic. why not in the menu?Oil = uses too muchCarrots in the dough = not necessary Onion in the dough = totally not necessary Well, it almost tastes like okonomiyaki, but not quite. All those I bitched and commented, should be in the typical Japanese cooking recipe book and really easy to figure out... so While I have no objections that non-Japanese owns Japanese restaurant.. Please get the basics right, and at least try to provide a quality food.	0
Came here for brunch and started to get my drink on first thing in the morning. Their drinks are serious business. If I didn't have plans for later in the day, I would have found myself very happy by noon.	0
Grabbed dinner there with my boyfriend. I was pretty excited bc I've walked by plenty of times and thought the space looked really cool. I guess I just felt underwhelmed about the experience. The bartender was a little less than friendly, although the cocktail was pretty good. We were seated in a table in a semi crowded area near the hostess stand. The menu seemed a little all over the place. I understand they were going for an upscale comfort food theme from the fried chicken and waffle and the meatloaf sandwich on the menu. I got the steak which seemed like a decent enough deal at $20 and my boyfriend got some kind of Vietnamese sandwich. The steak portion was pretty skimpy, they kind of feathered it across the plate so it looks like more than it actually is. The sandwich my boyfriend got was cold and the bread was hard and stale. I'd save your money visit Natt Spil down the street for a better meal at about half the price.	1
slightly spicy curried flavored salad with cooked eggs	1
Get to the Chase:<br><br>Pros:<br>1) Have custards of the day<br>2) Not McD prices, but not Manhattan-standard prices iether: $30ish dollars for 2 sodas, 1 hotdog, fries, 1 burger<br>3) They sell dog food too...wierd<br><br>Cons:<br>1) Wasn&#39;t impressed and still don&#39;t get why it&#39;s always packed. Burgers and fries are no better than any other burger. Nothing<br>2) The price isn&#39;t justified for what you get<br>3) Their milklshakes are extreeemely heavy with just dollops of ice cream and artificial flavoring<br><br>Order of the day: Shake-cago Hotodg, Shack Stack, Fries, Draught Root Beer, Dr. Pepper, Shroom Burger	0
I used to love this place.Parking:Valet parking for $3. Service:I went around 1am on Saturday...and the servers looked really out of it. Bunch of guys working in the cashier. I ordered togo on the phone and went to pick it up...literally had to wait 20+ minutes even though it wasn't even that busy.Food:Why does the chicken not have any meat on it? I ordered 20pcs chicken wings... and all I remember eating was the fried skin.. is it even real chicken? lol.It's really disappointing because I love their seasoning. (soy + spicy) I'm a petit girl. I killed the wings and I was still hungry. :( Their quality has gone down...	0
This place is adorable! The food is great- it is expensive but the view and the food is great.Customer service is excellent.Last night we went and waited in line. There were three people in front of us. as time went by more people added to the number of the people in front of us by the time we were almost close to getting in their number grow to 20. The girl at the door knew they were cutting in line and she sent them to the back of the line, that was the best feeling ever when she did that. :)The location is at the heart of downtown LA there is a big parking lot in front of the building and they have Valet so you won't have problem parking.	1
Another place I pass on the way home from work everyday. I went on a Wednesday afternoon and it just happened to be happy hour. Awesome! They had Delirium Tremens for $6! I kinda wanted to give them 5 stars just for that. We ordered the six burger and it was great. Anything I ever wanted in a burger. Then I noticed a blonde looking curl in our fries. I didn't make a big fuss about it cuz I work at a restaurant and I understand that these things happen, but then I found 3 more. I asked the server and he checked with the kitchen staff. He came back and explained that it was string from the burlap sack that the potatoes came in. It made perfect sense. No one in the restaurant had blonde hair. I ate the rest of the meal and was very happy. The food was great, the server was on point, and the environment was comfortable and relaxing. It has a great community feel to it. The server took 25% of our burger because of the burlap strings. I told him he absolutely didn't have to but he insisted. I will definitely be coming back one of these Sundays for brunch. They have endless mimosas and endless Great White beer which is one of my faves.	1
Gluten free everything (almost). It&#39;s so great to look at a menu and not be confined to just a few things on the menu. Food was ready in 3ish minutes, came in a plastic Tupperware tub, but tasted like white tablecloth sit down expensive food. I will be back!!	1
I&#39;ve been waiting in anticipation for this restaurant to open since I live nearby. Finally got to eat here &amp; it was popping during lunch hour! Not surprised though.. That&#39;s Summerlin people &amp; health nutty places for ya. Each table has a tablet with their menu/ordering system on it &amp; I like the concept, but it seemed a little unorganized. Maybe because they just opened a few days ago? I ordered the daily detox juice &amp; the shrimp superfood protein bowl -- Yuuum! I&#39;m already looking forward to my next visit because there are so many things I still want to try. Perfect place to go to grab some healthy vegetarian-friendly eats.	1
Cute! Full on a Friday night around 10, but the hostess was nice enough to split off a table from a double-table a couple was using only one side of and give it to us to sit down and eat. They really were good at utilizing the space, there were quite a few older couples who sat at tables for a good hour after they were done buying any service at all.<br><br>The poke was spicy, but awesome! It&#39;s a hawaiian raw-fish cube dish, served in a cup with &#34;taro taco&#34; shells for you to eat them in, I loved it. Edamame was only $4, two appetizers and a beer were perfect for my bf and I while we killed time before a club!	1
Def one of the better burgers in la, umami burger does what it names suggests and causes your mouth to water in the most delightful way due to the delectable tastes going into your mouth. I usually get the veggie sloppy or the ahi tuna burger because I am pescetarian but when I used to eat meat I liked the the hatch burger. In addition to all of the burgers which are each better than the next, they make some mean French and sweet potato fries. If you are in a really decadent mood get truffle everything. Yum!They have a solid beer and cocktail collection too so this can be a good place to go with the boys for a burger and beer or a date with the lady as they have salads too ;). The decor fits the tone of the restaurant perfectly and the service is as you would want it to be: sharp, honest, experienced without being too comfortable. Always a toss up between this and stout around the corner. Have to try both if you have not.	1
I can see why this place has such mixed reviews; it is a lounge after all. The trick is to go early to avoid waiting in line. Anytime you have to wait in line, score goes down automatically. As for us, we arrived at the restaurant around 8:45 for a dinner party, so the experience was quite astonishing.The elevators set the swanky and urbany tones. The restaurant itself is decent sized; it feels spacious because it's half open on the rooftop. I didn't get to top floor but we had out table set up out in the patio on the 1st floor of the restaurant. As everyone else has mentioned, amazing view and the ambiance! I especially love the retro couches/chairs and painted tiled floors. It sort of reminds me of Edison where a flapper dress would've totally fit in.I was with a bday party of 13 so we sort of ordered and shared bites tapa-style, and mostly appetizers. - Complimentary bread with butter and olive spread (5 stars). I'm not just giving it 5 stars because it's complimentary, haha... I loved how they were handed out individually by the server onto each one of our plates, and as many as you wish. The rolls were fresh, and the olive spread was a nice touch.- Cheese Dip (4 stars). This is a great sharing dish, perfect munchy food with drinks too! Love the Balsamic swirl on top of the cheese.- Duck Duck Goose (3 stars). 3 finger sandwiches with smoked duck meat; I liked the flavor of the meat and the european lettuce, but the bread tasted stale. - Porkbelly sliders (5 Stars). Deeeeeeeelish little smoked pork belly sliders with fried quail eggs on top! YUM... the porkbelly was extremely aromatic, smoky and crispy (think extra-thick sliced bacon), not fatty at all! And how cute are these tiny little fried quail eggs, perfectly cooked with runny yokes. *Note to self - steal the idea and add lil fried quail eggs to sliders at the next dinner party or potluck*- Steamed Mussels (3.5 stars). Quite generous for appetizer portion and for the price. Decent flavored broth, nothing amazing.- Shake-n-bake Frog drummies (3 stars). I was impressed with the originality and the presentation, but underwhelmed with the taste. Tasted very bland, like under-seasoned chicken. - Shredded Rabbit (3 stars). This dish is a bit confusing. It comes with bread and kumquat puree on the side, like a spread. But when you fork into the meat, it just falls apart (not spread-able). There is no binding, instead in the texture of pull pork (without any sauce). Interesting dish but forgettable.Dishes on the other end of the table looked interesting too. The restaurant is definitely keen on presentations. Overall this isn't a place you'd come to pig-out and expect a revolutionary culinary experience. But for the beautiful lounge atmospheres and superb service (both bartenders and wait staffs!), I'm very fond of this place. Crowd: Older, more mature yuppies.Price: $$. (We expected to pay more, turned out reasonable. That's always a plus!)	1
First time I came here was with my cousin, and then they already got me hooked on their happy hour menu. Then just yesterday me and my boyfriend came in and we found out happy hour is all day PLUS buy one get one free beer?! Hell yeahhh! (:<br>We ordered the: salmon carpaccio, korean kalbi, karage, calamari. I highly recommend all of them. <br>Owner is nice, server was nice and atmosphere was pretty upbeat. <br>Definitely worth the 30 min drive from my house even tho I have a korean bbq 5mins away. <br><br>my new favorite korean bbq	1
If you order a well drink like bourbon on the rocks. They charge you $2 for the rocks and $5 for the well drink. When the we&#39;ll drink is $5. But if you order buffalo trace on the rocks they charge you $15 for the drink but no $2 charge for the rocks? Could someone explain this to me? (Manager from herbs and rye) I&#39;m confused that you would charge for rocks on one drink and not the other. This place will nickel and dime you for the drinks you order there.	0
This little shack in the wall, always have a line out the door and sometimes it&#39;s even down to the block. I think what everyone on line is here for is the enormous portions of roast pork that the owner chops up and puts into the small rice box. This place used to be only $2.75 for a small box of roast pork rice, now it&#39;s $3.50! I can go next door to get 3 items over rice. <br><br>To be honest the roast pork, although it is plentiful; it&#39;s very skinny and chopped thinly. The soy sauce is what makes the rice saucy. However for the couple who owns this place to go from a cart serving rice rolls to now their own hole in the wall, it&#39;s a great achievement and great step in this economy!	0
I got Jamerica takeout and it was REALLY messy but SO worth it. The mango run chicken was enormous and everything I could have asked for. Each element was flavorful and satisfying on their own but together they were magical.	0
Everything&#39;s so delicious - not too heavy or greasy; the tastes are evenly balanced. My new favorite restaurant - I haven&#39;t had anything on the menu I didn&#39;t like. Love the bibimbap!	1
Wonderful customer service, delivered within given time and Hot, great tasting pizza like New York Pizza. Only reason they didn&#39;t get a 5 star was simply because it was a little too greasy for my taste... after patting it down it was still delicious.	1
Apparently reservations don't count for much here. We had a 7:15 pm dinner reservation. At about 6:30 pm, someone from the restaurant phoned me to say they were very backed up and we should come over at 7:40 or later. That has NEVER happened to me before. When we got to the restaurant we found it filled with people heading to a Key Arena concert. We had to wait another 20 minutes for a table. Apparently the restaurant got greedy. People without reservations showed up for a pre concert dinner and they seated them, thus screwing over people with reservations.	0
My friends and I, in town for Lollapalooza, were searching for a great place to celebrate my birthday. We found Unite Urban Grille and were incredibly satisfied! I had the 8oz Hanger steak cooked perfect to my liking (medium). As for my friend&#39;s dishes, they were all AMAZING! The Unite Burger - fantastically flavorful. Everyone should definitely try the Shrimp Skewers (side dish or full entree). The mango salsa on the shrimp had the perfect sweet kick. Another friend had the salmon, which he enjoyed. And as for the desserts - WONDERFUL! We had the Peanut Butter Mousse Cake (gluten- free) and Lemon Layer Cake. Both were great! I would definitely suggest this place to anyone looking for terrific food in a chill environment.	1
Strike 2, David Bracha...Chef, this is the second time I am unpleasantly surprised, after highly recommending your restaurant. <br><br>I have always been a huge fan of River Oyster Bar- naming it one of the most underrated restaurants in Miami.. I even believed ROB was better than the chef&#39;s newer restaurant, Oak Tavern in the design district. Thus, I recommended this restaurant for my friend&#39;s BIRTHDAY yesterday. <br><br>In the past, my biggest issue with this restaurant has been that when you order the whole fish, the wait staff plainly refuses to de-bone the fish for you. I thought it was unacceptable even in my early foodie days... That being said, I chose not to order the whole fish, and ordered the following... Ceviche, Burrata, Pork Belly Flatbread, and one stone crab claw (not even select size costing 23$). Now, before we get to the rest of it, let me fill you in. Last week I dined at Joe&#39;s Stone Crab, where I ordered an entire pound (5 select claws) for 58 bucks. You don&#39;t have to be an accountant to know I was being slammed with a 23$ single claw that didn&#39;t even come to the table cracked. I sent back the claw because I struggled at the table for 15 minutes, only to find that nothing was coming out. The waitress argued with me before taking the claw back to be cracked, and then proceeded to bring it back, uncracked!! Yes, I still paid for the full amount of the claw, and yes the meat remained in the UNCRACKED claw. <br><br>MOREOVER.... I wasn&#39;t able to finish the ceviche or the Burrata.. why? you may ask? Oh because our plates were removed from the table without even asking, and the half eaten burrata was cleared from the table without my asking, even though I had specifically asked that the burrata accompany the flatbread as my main dish. I guess my issue is not so much with the actual kitchen as it is with the service. Of course, we gave 20% tip, but diners, be advised. You don&#39;t get the 3 or even 4 star dining experience, overall. What you get is good food and that&#39;s it, unfortunately.	0
I went to Cole&#39;s two times and every time I had bad experience. First of all food was not that good and tasting stale. I thought it might be the one time thing but when I went second time, it was even worst. I complained about the food to the waiter and he didnt show the courtesy to offer me the replacement. Plus when I checked my CC bills after a month, I noticed that they charged me more than they suppose to. Compare to Philippe, Cole&#39;s is way better in food quality and service. I think everyone should try Cole&#39;s French Dip once in their life.	0
I&#39;ll say, before offering up my review, that I am not typically a review-writer. We do however, live in a world in which people will often tell you--in no uncertain terms--if you are doing something wrong, so I would be remiss if I didn&#39;t tip my hat to Perch for getting a few things right.<br><br>They&#39;ve created an environment geared toward &#34;professional relaxation&#34;. I&#39;d leave the kiddies at home for a jaunt down to Perch. I&#39;ve been there several times and the crowd seems to be the young(ish), sexy and sophisticated business professional crowd of downtown LA looking for a place to unwind. A chat with the bartender manager revealed an easy-to-talk-to woman keen on her history of the drinks she was serving, when asked about them. (A good bartender usually ensures their tip in some similar manner.) She was kind enough to offer us a free round as well. (After spending about $120 bucks, I appreciated the show of customer loyalty.) It&#39;s not the cheapest place but you&#39;ll get a solid bang for your buck with the ambiance that&#39;s created by the well-mannered servers and recently updated decor. It can bit a wee bit chilly atop the high-rise following sunset, so bring a jacket if you plan to spend an evening up there; but the sunsets themselves...very sexy and worth the trip. It makes a good &#34;date&#34; spot. Guys, if there&#39;s any interest from the lady, she&#39;ll have to throw you a smooch (or two) after going here.<br><br>Do yourself a favor and check out Perch on a Thursday or Friday evening. You won&#39;t be disappointed. Oh...and don&#39;t forget to rock.	1
BTW - There's a Carl's Jr. Pastrami Burger commercial running right now that's shot inside of Canter's...AND THERE IS NO WAY THAT BURGER COULD EVEN COME CLOSE TO COMPETING... Sorry Carl's' Jr.	1
I've been back several times for breakfast and lunch (hard to stay away from a $5 breakfast here!). I think breakfast might be the best meal. Lots of choices, and everything we've had was well done. Generous French press coffee service. The Seafood Gumbo at lunch was not my favorite, and Im not sure why, except I didn't like the taste much. It was dark, but very thin, and not the taste I remember from New Orleans (or mine). My favorite lunch so far was Foie Gras on Savory Pain Perdu. I knew it wouldn't be a giant portion, but I had to order it to get it off my mind. It was probably barely 2x3 inches, but so much flavor in those few bites! I also shared some Haricots Verts with bacon, slightly undercooked (there is a difference between al dente and undercooked). The amazing thing was that I was satisfied for many hours until dinner. There are reasons to enjoy fat!	0
As with some of the readers, I have been to Japan as well and have their food in its native environment. However, the food here was a bit disappointing. The only reason they received 4 stars instead of 3 was because of how fast the food came out. I ordered the sashimi, sushi and chicken teriayaki bento and my girlfriend ordered the Unagi Don. We also had two extra orders of salmon and tuna nigiri. First, the salmon and tuna just did not have that fresh taste to it. I believe there was bits of ice on the fish as well. the rice attached to it fell apart right away and made it a bit hard to eat. I always use my hands to eat Nigiri because sushi was first made outside of Japanese theatre&#39;s as a sort of finger food. How awesome huh? Movie theatre nachos aint got s#!t on sushi (:<br><br>Anyways our main courses arrived right after and the teriyaki was pretty mediocre. I didn&#39;t like how some of the chicken was burnt and had this bitter taste to it that couldn&#39;t even be masked by the teriyaki sauce. I liked how they had accompanying sushi and sashimi however they had the same problems as the aforementioned appetizers.<br><br>My girlfriend ordered the Unagi don which is basically eel with this sweet teriyaki-like sauce over rice. Very simple and when I had it in Japan the eel was tender and the sauce was well flavored. It was pretty good here too except the eel was a bit tough in some places and almost a bit dried out in the center, which I don&#39;t really like. I like my unagi don soft and saucy and eaten with lots of rice (:<br><br>All in all the experience was okay, they served green tea ice cream at the end which my girlfriend and I don&#39;t eat and the service was pretty good and the wait for food was pretty short. I think next time i&#39;d like to try other places within Little Tokyo.	1
If you like Roast Beef Sandwiches, eating outside, fast food which isn't overly processed/plastic, nostalgic decor, cleanliness, and fast service, this spot is for you! Amazing sammy's, relatively cheap, quick service, and friendly staff are all what you'll encounter. Eat inside the small spot, or outside in the covered patio. It's not fancy or gastro-pub...so don't judge it like that. But it's great in it's own context.	1
Thought I was sitting down at a simple but solid diner. Found out otherwise. The food was fine, but the coffee and tea were horrendous; the prices were high, and the service was mediocre. This place is a cheap diner with posh restaurant prices. Look elsewhere on Union, or better yet, leave the neighborhood.	0
We got the special, cauliflower-garlic-olive oil-smoked mozzarella. ..absolutely fabulous. Second pizza was the fennel sausage and was also stunning. Great service, great vibe. Good way to end our last evening in Seattle!	1
I'm always a fan of businesses active & on top of their Yelp / social media. Luna Park is one of those. The owner Peter came up to us & we talked about their Yelp deal! Especially in LA, its always a great feeling to learn that the owner really does care about your experience in their restaurant. This is a rare quality. If it's your first time, you must try the Mussels & Frites and the El Camerone Pizza. They have a really outstanding Happy Hour 2 for 1 Appetizers & Drinks till 7pm on weekdays. You can't beat that! I NEED to try dessert next time!!!	1
The owner of this Annapolis favorite, Paul Meyer,  continues to provide a wonderful experience and fine food.  I had not been in a while but once again, excellent by every measure.	0
Moving and packing sucks especially when it&#39;s some of your best friends leaving for the burbs. Helping them get ready for their move into the land of strip malls, we got hungry. For lunch, we went to Birchwood Kitchen and got takeout. Judging by the takeout line, I knew this place had to be good. Our friend enlightened me on the best sandwiches to try here. I followed his lead and ordered a grilled gruyere with ham. While waiting in line, he gushed about how awesome the cookies were. So, we got one for everyone who helped pack minus their toddler. <br><br>Oh that first bite of the sandwich was heavenly. Birchwood Kitchen&#39;s grilled gruyere sandwich is the grownup version of grilled cheese. They packed the sandwich with ham and cheese with a delicious spread of djion mustard to compliment the cheeses. Wow, that sandwich totally made my day. The chocolate chip cookie lived up to the hype of being one of the best chocolate chip cookies. It reminded me of the warm, gooey ones Mom makes right out of the oven. The sandwich and the cookie were so good that I would go out of my way just to have that meal again.	1
Tried brisket and beef rib. Huge rib. Good but the brisket was way better. Try that! Not a fan of the beans and potato salad. Mac and cheese was pretty good though!	0
After hearing stellar reviews about this restaurant as one of the top Steakhouse in Vegas, my friend Jordan and I decided to check this place out. It is located inside The D, downtown.<br><br>The restaurant itself have a very nice atmosphere. We were sat in a tall, private, circular booth that would be ideal for a romantic date night. Our server was very attentive and helped assist in pairing a nice glass of red wine to our steak. <br><br>For our appetizer, we had the beet salad (very sweet with yellow and red beets accompanied with a mayo drizzle) and the lobster risotto (not a fan- was bland and missing wine!).<br>Our steak was cooked perfectly to order and seasoned nicely.<br>Our server wheeled out the a tall tier of dessert after our main course and we were able to pick and choose instead of looking at a menu. <br>Dessert was a light, flavorful, and decadent coconut cake with coconut shreds, whipped cream and whatever else I can&#39;t remember... It was heavenly and my favorite part of dinner.<br><br>Overall this is a decent steakhouse(my favorite steakhouse will always be CUT) and very reasonably priced for the service that you receive<br>Our total bill came out to about $140 before tip for 2 glasses of wine, 2 appetizer, steak main course and dessert.	1
I wish I could place the photo for reference here but I did add the photo to the collection. I was excited to try The Perch for the first time last night. I ordered their $20 Egg Salad with steak and ask for it to go. My destination was right in the park so this wasn&#39;t due to travel time but when I opened up my salad, I was extremely disappointed. The bread crostini were so hard I couldn&#39;t even eat them, literally could not even bite into it. The poached egg was still half raw and yolkless, couldn&#39;t eat it that either. The steak was really rare and looked like it had been squeezed together. The salad itself was seriously maybe 6 bites worth that included some bacon pieces, possibly less than 2oz of steak. This was not a refined $20 salad I was expecting, it was a $4 dollar salad at best. I will not be trying there food again because the lack of passion for the food clearly shows. Restaurants should be proud of the food they are putting out, even if it is to go.	0
So, they may as well have played Glory Days when I walked in here for dinner the other night. I have very fond memories of this place from when I was in my early 20s and used to visit friends that went to school here. Maybe I was one of those annoying people that Yelpers are complaining about being drunk and obnoxious.	0
Meatball heaven! I love meatballs so once my boyfriend found this little gem we knew it was a must try. We ordered the grinder with pork meatballs and pesto sauce and ballacart balls with mushroom gravy and also cheddar cheese sauce. Beer selection is huge! We tried about 5 different beers. Highly suggest trying a strawberry beer. Service was awesome and rapid. Can&#39;t wait to come back &amp; try more.	1
The watermelon lemonade is freaking brilliant....so was pork sandwich and mac and cheese cupcake. <br>I&#39;ll be back this weekend...or tonight. :)	1
Loved this place!<br>The food was scrumptious, and the atmosphere had its cool going on, creative, unique and cozy. The staff was just lovely.<br>Definitely pay a visit, it will quickly become a favorite.	1
I&#39;ve eaten here several times and have tried a couple of different dishes. Honestly, I only give it two stars because I always receive exceptional service here. From the menu, the only thing that I&#39;d recommend with confidence is the chicken meatballs appetizer. The rest of the food is hit or miss depending on who is in the kitchen. I don&#39;t expect much here either, but the food is just inedible at times.<br><br>Oh yeah, soup and salad deal isn&#39;t bad at all, but I can&#39;t really up any stars for that. 2 is generous enough	0
Garlic noodles with Five Spice chicken!!??!!  My hopes were really high for this place... but when the food came out, I looked at it and sniffed it........... where the fuck is the garlic smell???? The texture of the noodles were good but I barely tasted any garlic.. it was bland and it sucked.Five spice Chicken? I liked the skin it was really crispy!Imperial Rolls?? It was a joke that shit was stale and had a foul smell when I bit into it.Fish sauce was also very bland. i don't get how this place got such a high rating, but I'm pretty sure its because you can't get Garlic Noodles w/ Five spice chicken anywhere else..	0
Im confused here.The cherry tomatoes on this november filetti pizza were very oddly bitter. We said as much to the waitress. There was exactly one bite taken from this pizza, her response was "do you want to take this pizza home?" Odd again. After we said no, she tossed it. Yet we were charged for it. Reason being, this is how the pizza usually is. No it's not, I would never return for bitter tasting food. I was really hurt, that they have a no complaint policy here. What is this, the pizza lottery? Either you get a winner or you don't at your cost? I'm so upset, I don't want this culture of food to exist anywhere, can't believe it's operating right here, this whole time at one of my favorite places... I'm really sad here : (	0
Very very bland food, I really wanted to love this place, and I was very disappointed	0
My mum and I decided to go here for lunch today since we were in the mood for Sino-Korean food and she wanted to check it out since she read that they had recently renovated. They offer valet parking in the back, but we opted for free street parking instead.<br><br>We walked in to find a family waiting at the front desk, with no employees in sight. They were waiting to pay for their food and leave, so I thought they must be in a hurry. But no one was coming to help them... or to seat us! I did see servers walking around, but they just looked at us blankly and ignored us. Finally after several minutes of waiting one of them came to seat us. I was already feeling a bit critical on being ignored upon entering, so my opinion of this place just went even lower when they handed us torn menus that were taped together. Mine didn&#39;t even have a cover on it. This place is advertising that they&#39;re newly remodeled and yet they&#39;re giving customers crappy torn menus?! NOT COOL.<br><br>I will say that the venue looked pretty nice. They have a wall of large rooms which apparently can open into one really huge banquet hall. The main dining area has a large TV, which was playing the Lakers game. And their bathroom is clean (two stalls) but smelled really strongly of bleach.<br><br>The food did make me feel a little better about this place. For side dishes, they give you kimchi (mum said it was just OK), kkakdugi (this was pretty good), raw onions, and danmoogi (yellow picked radish). I ordered a small jjajangmyun and my mum ordered a small jjampong; we also ordered spicy garlic shrimp to share. I appreciate that they offer small portions of their noodles, since my mum and I wanted completely different items. The jjajangmyun was pretty decent, and my mum thought the same of the jjampong. Neither of us were a fan, however, of the spicy garlic shrimp. It wasn&#39;t bad, per say, it just wasn&#39;t very good. A bit disappointing.<br><br>Service was also pretty slow. I had to flag someone down whenever I wanted anything, and I never did get a refill on my water :( Overall, the food here is decent, but why bother coming back when the food is better at Young King across the street and the service is much better?!	0
Generous portions.  Reasonably priced.  Friendly and responsive service.  Excellent food.	1
came here and had a late lunch. i ordered the wedge salad with soup for $12.50 it was definitely nothing spectacular a wedge of lettuce sprinkled with salad dressing and bacon bits far from spectacular. i also had the ahi tuna for the amount you get and the price tag it was not worth it.	0
I'm pretty generous with stars actually. So I would've given this place 5 if only their chicken was not so dry.I came for dinner and ordered under their "house specials" the Kai Yang Dinner (which is basically their Thai BBQ chicken but with the shrimp fried rice). Their Thai BBQ chicken is one of their famous plate.Their decor look outdated, old-school. Service was fair.I first came here few years ago and remembered it being good enough to come back. So I came for dinner on a friday night around 7:30pm. There wasn't a long line, which I expected, but glad there wasn't. So we were seated within 5 minutes.The chicken had a nice charred flavored skin, their famous honey bbq dip, and their delicious shrimp fried rice. Even their two pieces of fried shrimp was tasty with a subtle crunch. I mixed my fried rice with their chili and jalepeno juice sauce(yum). It was overall very good, except their very dry chicken. But for me, all the other good flavors made up for it.My bf's Pad See Ew was more disappointing. First off, once arriving to your table the visual appeal of the food was not enticing. It was just an all brown mush of noodles with the green colors of broccoli. But who cares as long as it tastes good right? It was OK. Kind of sticky on eachother and after shoving the same brown noodle, you will get sick of finishing it.But I still like their bbq chicken and will be back a few years later.	1
The two stars are for the view. Everything else was average. The food at the restaurant was pricey but yet bland. The rooftop bar didn't have enough sitting area, although they done good beers.	0
The side of fries were yummy and accompanied my drink well...I don&#39;t remember much else.	1
The Barrymore seemed like a Vegas boutique hotel just a short cab ride away from our hotel on the strip. The food was excellent and offered a nice balance of selections for traditional and experimental eaters. And our one sister had many choices for gluten free eating. Those who had steaks said they were among the best.  Same for the fish. Sides were shared and provided a fantastic array of dining pleasures.   It was the service, though, that made the evening. I felt like I was on a 5 star cruise ship. Or maybe it was the half priced wine at happy hour that enhanced the evening! Lovely experience all around. Thanks. Sorry if we were too rowdy.	1
Always Great!!! Amazing food and amazing people! Check out the bacon cheese burger!	1
I&#39;m not sure how this place got such great reviews. I&#39;ve eaten at many Korean places and this place was by far the worst food, if not the worst dinner, I have ever eaten. <br><br>The broth was completely watered down, the tea was just hot water, and the meat was fatty and dry. <br><br>The kimchi and raddish were good but it&#39;s hard to mess that up.	0
This place is FUN! Once you walk in the ambiance is like you just walked into a Latin themed Disney World. Delicious food, the bandeja paisa is my recommendation hands down! Start off with a few Colombian empanadas, and wash it down with un refajo (its a concoction of half Colombian beer and half Colombian soda, works as a great hangover recipe too!)	1
super fresh and delicious.3 staple soups and 3 chef specials that are different everyday. toasty, crusty bread to dip in the soup...the tomato basil soup and a grilled cheese is just a super classic, but always ask the chef what&#39;s new, she always has some great stuff working. very friendly place. She made a shrimp bisque one time and it was on point. definitely made my day, such a great spot.....lacks one star for the parking...other wise food and service are great.	1
This was the worst service I've had in a long time. Can you guess how long it took for someone to come by to take our drink orders after we sat down? Just take a wild guess.A friend of mine guessed 10 minutes. HA! I wish!We waited .... 50 MINUTES. That's right. Nearly an ENTIRE HOUR. We finally got a waitress after we asked TWO separate employees if someone was serving our table. The waitress commented that it was because our waiter James was on a break. Funny, because I know which one is James and he had been helping the table next to us during the past hour. Needless to say, I am never coming back here. I would tell you what I thought about the food, but honestly it doesn't even matter after service like this.	0
I am addicted to ramen, and Takara&#39;s Miso ramen is probably my favorite ramen ever. The broth is the best I&#39;ve had-- super rich, and oh-so-flavorful. The noodles, garnishes, etc. are all well and good. Pretty expensive, but I know, its Hollywood price and It&#39;ll be offset with the quality of the ramen. <br>Will come back for sure:)	1
After a previous review, we went back for Sunday brunch. I had the crab Benedict and my husband had the salmon Benedict. Both were delicious.It was a beautiful day, so it was a perfect spot! I am glad we went back and had a meal instead of just beers and a snack. The place is a little pricey, don't expect to go there and spend less than $50 for 2 people sans alcohol.	1
Nothing compared to Yakitori Totto! We came to this place after having a great experience in Yakitori Totto and seeing all the good reviews about Taisho, but we were dead wrong. We were seated in the little sketchy room in the very back of the restaurant. The skewers came burnt and didn&#39;t even taste close to Totto&#39;s. Never coming back.	0
This place was awful. My boyfriend and I went here for a late dinner. We received our appetizer and salad and everything was cool. My boyfriend got his meal and I didn't. I figured mine would be out shortly. 20 minutes later, my boyfriend asked the waiter where my meal was. The waiter half ass apologizes to me for "forgetting" to put my order in and that he would put it in and it would be out quickly. Another 20 minutes later I receive my meal. it was literally a charred burger on a stale bun with a piece of cheese on top. I was so upset that I asked for the bill. I just wanted to leave. The waiter never returned. We could've just walked out. We walked up to the register and after waiting another 15 minutes we were finally able to leave. I was in a bad mood all night because of the shitty service. Horrible. Horrible. Horrible. I can't say it enough.	0
We truly enjoyed Stripers. Before our reservation we ordered a glass of wine and sat in the Adirondacks on the lawn looking out to the ocean. We saw the sun set and the moon rise. The wine was extremely good. The ambience is so relaxing but far from casual everyday. It was special. The food very good. Our waiter a delight.	1
We got the opportunity to experience AJ Bombers yesterday. To start off the service was fantastic it looked as if there was one person working the bar and dining area but since it was not overly busy he did a fantastic job keeping us all happy and making suggestions off the menu if we asked as well as suggestions on different beers etc. Our kids loved the fact that they could draw all over the chalkboard it kept them occupied while we waited for our food which is awesome gave my hubby and I the opportunity to actually talk which is rare with 3 monsters Also my kids got a kick out of the fact that they could throw peanut shells on the floor they just could not believe it when I told them so I had to actually get up and show them that it is ok here but not at home! The big bummer was the actual planes that bring the peanuts to your table were broken :( and my kids really wanted to see that! Ok on to the food. We had a Bloody Mary which was ok I mean yeah it was good but I was not jumping for joy over it. It had quite a few little snacks in it as well. I ordered the buffalo chicken egg rolls to start and my hubby ordered the cheese curds. The buffalo chicken egg rolls were super yummy they were pretty much buffalo chicken wrapped in an egg roll the chicken was not overly spicy just the perfect amount of spice for me. I never tried the cheese curds but my husband seemed to enjoy them and so did our 3 year old. On to the burgers which for me sadly was somewhat of a disappointment. I am a burger lover seriously who does not enjoy a good burger?!?!? So I ordered the Mad Sconnie Burger I was expecting a monster for $8.75 for the burger ALONE and when it was brought to my table I was like seriously this is it!?! It was small not what I was expecting. The flavor was ok but nothing I would get overly excited about. My husband ordered the Bomber burger which was the messiest and I tried it was ok but like mine I was not overly impressed. So all in all it was a disappointing visit considering I was looking forward to indulging in a magnificent burger and had a mediocre one instead and not to mention I think they are pricey for what you get which is not much :( I don't foresee us going back unfortunately.	1
Who doesn't love pie? Pie and a pint, or a pietini, as they serve here.	0
Great place to lounge day or night.Try the Burger, its among the best in LA.	1
Claims to be healthy even says they want to help you make healthy choices. Yet they serve soy products, agave and raw kale. I can understand some people wanting to be vegetarian but at least make the right choices and don&#39;t spread false information and food that are part of the problems of why people are sick.	0
Never order any curry dishes. Perhaps it's my fault for ordering curry at a noodle house but the tiny sliver of katsu (pork) on my curry was offensively tiny for $11. About 3 bites worth.	0
I&#39;m so happy there&#39;s a good Indian restaurant in Los Feliz now. Went here a few nights ago and had a great meal. Their hottest level of spice is pretty hot, but if you&#39;re used to the blandness of the other Indian spot on Vermont, you&#39;re in for a nice surprise with this place -- lots of flavor, even when it&#39;s hot. Great selection of veggie stuff and the staff is super nice. I really hope people keep going here and it sticks around.	1
Food was great. Management or whoever takes down reservations sucked. If they lose your reservation, you will be seated in front of a cold door. I hope all gratuity that was included on the bill goes to waiting staff and kitchen. While the food was really good, i wont ever go back... NYC has many other great chicken spots.	0
I am neither from south nor have southern food before, besides I love fried chicken and chicken wings just like everyone else. I found Pies-and-Thighs yesterday, and I realized the taco place next door has been closed already. Not sure the story behind the name of restaurant but it caught my attention. I came for breakfast today, it&#39;s very southern and country breakfast diner style. You can see the preparation of your food, it&#39;s behind the counter. They have nice little wooden table and booth just enough for per person. The menu is mostly as usual such as egg, sandwich, salad and fried chicken. Also I love their pecans butter donut, peanuts on the top and the donut doesn&#39;t seem too sweet which is good, because a lot places make their donut bit sweet. The Banjo with sausage was delicious, sausage is very different, I can tell it might be fresh made by themselves. Interesting to know and I loved it. It&#39;s a good place to go for breakfast and brunch.	1
I got a little tipsy after my visit to Fornino. Thats a good thing!<br><br>I don&#39;t particularly love thin crusted pizza, but I like what they do here.<br><br>Their funghi misti pizza is sooo good. Its drizzled with white truffle oil and covered with mozzarella and a whole bunch of other kinds of mushrooms.<br><br>I also tried one with a sausage I think its the Salsiccia Di Pollo, it was very tasty. I love the cheese they use.<br><br>Portions are a bit small, but its totally worth it since you also get to enjoy an unbeatable front row view looking out into lower Manhattan and Statue of Liberty.<br><br>People should come here!	1
Oy. Dining, especially at the &#34;gastrobar&#34; end of the spectrum, isn&#39;t generally meant to be an exercise and humiliation and condescension. But egregiously titled J&#39;eatjet (say it out out loud, but in French) is doing to their best to bring this new attitude to the neighborhood.<br><br>I went last night around dusk and had to wander around the restaurant and the patio to find a server. She allowed me to sit on a two-top outside, right next to a water filling station. Here large jugs of tap water are put in a plastic container before being slowly pour into long, skinny wine bottles. Very complicated and time consuming, while not being additive in the slightest. <br><br>When my waitress and wine bottle arrived, I was told that the restaurant didn&#39;t have printed menus yet, but instead only had food written on a chalkboard. As it was now almost dark and the wooden patio is only lit with faux-vintage thick filament bulbs, the board was impossible to read from my table. <br><br>So I ordered and a beer asked what was on the menu. My waitress paused, looked confused and disappeared.<br><br>Ten minutes passed. A man in a striped shirt, obviously the manager, comes over and says: &#34;I hear you have some questions about the menu,&#34; with the tone of &#39;I hear you are an asshole.&#39;<br><br>Yes, I said, what&#39;s available?<br><br>&#34;Well the menu is clear on the chalkboard inside.&#34;<br><br>&#34;Should I go in there and look at it? What do you have?&#34;<br><br>Then he started to list out the items, but only one or two. We have a burger, he said, and lamb belly. I went to order the lamb belly, which he said was an appetizer portion. He then would say a couple more dishes, but wouldn&#39;t say if they were main courses or appetizers. I just wanted to order!<br><br>Eventually, I got the pretzel bites for an appetizer and a burger. I believe they also have pickled fried chicken, but no other entrees were told to me. Still no beer. My beer didn&#39;t come until another 15 minutes later, after two promises and a reorder. This beer was not comped, nor was there an apology offered for the mix-up. The pretzel bites came with a beer cheese that far outnumbered the pretzels and lacked bite. The burger served on attractive ring of wood, came with just a piece of lettuce garnish and some barbecue sauce, but no sides. That&#39;s fine, but it wasn&#39;t made clear when I ordered.<br><br>J&#39;eatjet is a new restaurant and there are bound to be kinks. Just don&#39;t take them out on your customers.	0
Longest wait for Two Tortas and One Taco. We ended up waiting for 40min. Not to mention our waiter forgot to serve our drinks and mess up on one of our tortas. One of the chefs did come out and asked us for our feedback he took our criticism well, but I do feel he should of done something more. Worst experience and service ever. Sorry guys, will not be coming here again.	0
This place is super yummy. Just be ready for the crowds and the typical LA scene. It does take a bit to sit down and parking can be a pain, so just valet. If its a super sunny day you should sit outside.They have a good menu - variety is key. We had the chicken chow salad and also some French Toast and it was both so fresh and good!	1
Nothing special at all! must be more granola eating wierdos with low standards who gave this place a positive review- I don't understand- My cappacino was good though-	0
I&#39;ve had a few of the panini&#39;s (lemoni supremo , mediterraneo , italiano) as well as the turkey wrap and they have all been wonderful. the smoothies are fresh and refreshing. the staff is friendly. i will be returning.	1
Love this place! Their fish tacos are delicious. <br><br>Plus they do a great happy hour later in the day (I think it goes from about 4-7) Shrimp and fish is always fresh and when you add avocado it&#39;s perfection. <br><br>Their shrimp tacos are fantastic! I go here all the time and have never been disappointed.<br><br>I just wish they were open a little later!	1
Ordered a pick-up order of Sausage and Peppers sandwich for lunch and what I got was best described as a soupy mess. My co-workers meals all looked good. At least they included someone else&#39;s meal with ours so I had something to eat. I may try this place again sometime, but definitely not ordering that again. <br><br>(I posted a photo of the &#34;sandwich&#34;)	0
The best Coffee in Seattle!!!!! El Diablo has the best Cafe Con Leche ever... well lets just say I have never found it any other place and there isn't anything like it.... Totally Amazing!	1
The ambiance in this night spot is turn&#39;t up. Beautiful ladies abound and i&#39;m sure the women feel the same about the fellas. It&#39;s a very nice crowd here and the food is very good. The seared ahi tuna is wonderful and light tasting (melt in your mouth type good). We also tried the buffalo frog legs and they were excellent. The view is gorgeous.	1
Love this place. The coffee is great, the bagels are AMAZING! I tried their bacon breakfast wrap this morning and that was great too.<br><br>My girlfriend always orders iced coffee, and this is the only place to use ice cubes made of coffee! Its great, your coffee is never watered down.	1
Thank you Sabrina for intriducing me to such a great sushi place!<br><br>This name literally describes the place. There is only a sushi bar to sit so have patience here. There is also 1 guy making the rolls so you need even more patience. So if you are lookign for a fast lunch during your break, this might not be the place for you. If you are a sushi lover and have all the time in the world, then please visit this place!<br><br>You can pick and choose your rolls from 2 different places. There is a menu you can look through that includes their simplier rolls and there is also a few dry erase boards with more rolls.<br><br>So far I hae tried the Alex #2 roll and the Ninja roll &amp; they are both Mmm! I like how they incorporate non-traditional items in the rolls like guava, mango, etc.	1
I&#39;ve been using yelp for years and this is the first time that I&#39;ve decided to actually join and leave a review. <br><br>I will make my review very short and concise: amazing food and EXCELLENT service. <br><br>Customer service that goes above and beyond your expectations. <br><br>We had the opportunity to share our experience with Chef James; he took the time to stop by our table a couple of times to explain the plates and checked on us. He also took the time to share a couple of other plates (that were not on the menu) to provide us with an unforgettable experience. <br><br>This is a MUST do from now on.	1
Roy Choi never disappoints man. Tried his latest restaurant with a large group of friends and family styled the meal. Everything was so tasty and fun! The aprons add a cute touch to the meal. And I like the cubby holes that hold the utensils for dinner. <br><br>There were 6 of us and we ordered the bbq spicy pork (my favorite!!), kimchi fried rice, kush, grilled squid, noodle of the day, poke me, and a large Boot Knocker to share. This was more than enough food for our party. We left feeling very full and satisfied. Every dish we ordered was great and had Choi&#39;s typical burse-ment of flavor with each bite. The man is gifted. The only thing I wasn&#39;t too obsessed with that we ordered would be the Boot Knocker. It definitely tasted and looked like something someone who had been smoking pot would throw together and cook haha. It was instant noodle with spam, sausages, and other canned meats. The broth was veryy spicy.. And that&#39;s the only taste I can remember about it. The soup was all sorts of random and didn&#39;t taste that exciting. But other than that, everything else was amazing and I can&#39;t wait to come back and eat here! Loved the atmosphere and the food!	1
When Toast first opened, there was a rumor among us NYC ex-pats that it was being run by the same delicious hands that brought us our beloved Magnolia Bakery. That this was ever true seems more and more dubious a claim. True, there are cupcakes to be bought that *look* a lot like Magnolia&#39;s, but a single bite tells you these are either Magnolia&#39;s 2-day-old leftovers, that much worse for the wear of shipping, or just crap LA imitations. <br><br>Beside the disappointing cupcakes, there&#39;s a whole dining experience just waiting to bum you out. From the throngs of clueless hipster clones driving wait times into the stratosphere, to the often rude service, to the overpriced diner food that will, eventually, reach your table. <br><br>Save yourself the time and frustration. The long line here is in no way an indication of desirability.	0
The locro and lomo saltado were so savory and delicious, I couldn't believe I had to get off Cloud 9 and go back to work. With the expected perfect LA weather, we sat on the balcony and took in this piquant decadence with a healthy dose of all the weirdness Hollywood has to offer. The service was good but we were also pretty much the only ones there. I can't wait to come back for evening drinks to experience the remodeled interior (which is gorgeous). The Tamarind & Smoke is calling my name.	1
There's nothing to complain about at Carmine's. Bring your friends and a big appetite. Everything was fantastic and the 7 of us had enough food left for another meal. Can't wait for next years visit	1
Always great service , honestly I don&#39;t mind waiting for my food. Cause the chicken fries are just too bomb !!	1
This place is great.<br><br>I have seen Colombian food on some of those travel channel shows. My mom would talk about certain meals when I was a kid. Both would talk about how huge the meals were. Yup, they were right.<br><br>I have had only two items here. Reason, both items are OUTSTANDING and I just can&#39;t get away from ordering my favorites. The Sancocho de Res Con Arroz is delicious. Bandeja paisa arroz, frijoles, maduro, huevo, arepa y chicharron also fantastic.<br><br>Check out their website <a href="/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsanpocho.com%2Fmenu.html&amp;s=38789557282be484ff2e3640918956ab9f8f9f58d8acc26949966fe7dda43941" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">sanpocho.com/menu.html</a><br>They describe the food through an interactive menu. Great job.<br><br>Both dishes were huge, tasty and great value. This is not fine dining, but if you want a good meal to start of your day or satisfy your hunger pains during the day, come on down.<br><br>Service is simple and fast. No frills just good food and a smile.	1
The 2 smallest, sweetest sandwiches (Banana, Strawberry) were the best here, as I wasn&#39;t as blown away by the 2 savory grilled cheeses (Classic, Crispy Goat) I ordered for nothing OOP after the Amazon Local voucher. After letting me know that I understandably couldn&#39;t stack the Yelp checkin special for a free drink with the Amazon Local offer, the very personable guy running the show offered to bring a water, but later decided he&#39;d offer the checkin special (though brought a Sprite, not Coke, odd). Skipped the late-running (12-5) lunch special (though it may not have been stackable anyway).<br><br>I was going to categorize things as those classing up the joint vs. those not, but that&#39;s not what grilled cheeseries are about, so...<br>Pluses:<br>Balthazar bread<br>Olives (jar likely tossed out mistakenly by many, should go disposable)<br>Cheese/cutting board<br>Awesome restroom<br>Great tunes overhead<br>Prices seem on par with Melt Shop<br><br>Minuses:<br>The consistency of the cheese on the classic and the crispy goat<br>The flavor of the classic -- could barely justify 4 stars given that they didn&#39;t really nail the benchmark<br>Wax paper over aforementioned cheese/cutting board (judging by the top of the trash, they still need to wash them between uses)<br>Aforementioned music was too louid for 4:30pm, though it still couldn&#39;t drown out the owner/manager (?) on a heated call with someone claiming to be ConEd stating they owned money, which frankly sounded like an extortion scam (if it wasn&#39;t, hope they&#39;re doing ok and they were lucky no other customers arrived)	1
Maybe I caught them on an off day (it was 9:30 on a Monday morning), but it was pretty so so. I got the eggs and potato fritata thing and it was thoroughly uninspiring. Salad bar looked good but haven&#39;t had a chance to try it.	0
I was in the mood for good sushi and decided to take my sister with me to Little Tokyo. It was my first time at Oomasa so I checked out what my fellow Yelpers have been yelping about. Saturday afternoon we waited for about ten minutes until we got seated on the counter. The restaurant was busy enough without service being affected. What to expect? As soon as you get inside the restaurant, you need to take a number [as opposed to writing your name on their waiting list ] and stand in line until one of the servers escort you to your seat. They will ask if you prefer the booth or the counter. At this point, since we didn't want to wait longer than 10 minutes [and we were starving] we decided to seat at the counter. The GOOD Stuff - Food and Prices! -Spicy Yellow Tail Roll spicy flavored yellow tail (4 pcs) $5 -Spider Roll soft shell crab, cucumber and sprout (4 pcs) $10 -Rainbow Roll tuna, yellowtail, halibut, salmon, eel and shrimp over california roll (6 pcs) $12 -Sashimi Lunch 3 kinds of fresh seafood. (served with soup, steamed rice, and japanese pickles) (9 pcs) 16.00 Everything we had was absolutely fantastic! The fish was fresh and it had really good flavors..making my tummy very happy. What you need to know? -Great sushi, sashimi and rolls selection at affordable price-Great for take out -Oomasa validates 2 hours free parking	1
This happen when the restaurant change the chef... The beginning was good, now horrible, just wasted money to garbage. Please find someone can cook Asian food, come on you open Hibachi which is Asian Food, so make sure they understand the taste of Asian food. You have good location.	0
Great sushi great service pricey but I guess you have to pay for qualty sushi. I had the godzila roll and the samon sunrise both were awsome. Two big hands on the belly.	1
If I can rate with 0 star I would totally do that. This place took 2 hours and 15 mins for take out orders that&#39;s only 7 miles away!! And I placed my order at 3:30pm on a Friday! Madness!!	0
I didn't feel slim or healthy after having lunch here but I must say I was pleasantly surprised by the food! We came here for lunch today and the restaurant was actually packed. My co-worker and I decided to share Combo 1, which comes with the Seafood Pesto Pasta, Half & Half Pizza, and 2 drinks. It came out to exactly $26.02 after tax, which is not bad at all. I also tried a bit of my other coworker's Kimchi & Fish Roe pasta. Everything was tasty and a good portion! We actually had a lot of leftovers too. I like the concept of it being "healthy" because they don't use MSG, sugar, or butter, etc. But since it's pasta and pizza, it was still pretty heavy! They do, however, use whole wheat pasta and wheat tortilla for the pizza crust (and they also have salads). Next time I want to try their Pumpkin Soup, served in an actual pumpkin! There's a parking lot next to it with 90 minute free with validation or you can always find street/meter parking.	1
YAY!! I walk by this place all the time and from the sidewalk, at least at night, it looks so cute inside. They must do wonders with the lighting because I went on a Sunday afternoon and the decor was just OK. I&#39;m not going to subtract points for that though because every dish we ordered was FAB! It was Happy Hour and I&#39;ll have to admit that the specials were not that great. The white wine was $7 a glass instead of the usual $8. Really? What kind of special is that? Oh well, I went with it anyway. The wine was a Soave that was perfectly fine. We first ordered the spicy burrata with sun-dried tomatoes and arugula. Now I&#39;m not sure what is rolled up in the middle of this but it was amazing!! A nice size ball of burrata with a very spicy center, plop a slice of that on a toast round with some tomatoes and arugula and pure heaven. Next up were the falafel buns. These were basically sliders in those lovely Chinese buns. The sauce and spices were just right and I could have eaten many more of these. Our last plate was the Brussels sprouts with bleu cheese and figs and this was pure sweet decadence. We weren&#39;t starving and although the portions are on the smaller side, I know this is a tapas type place but that range can be huge, we were satisfied with what we ordered. This will definitely be a neighborhood spot I will visit again and again.	1
Decent food. Bad service. Sat outside and a cockroach fell on my menu. Minus points for no discount.<br><br>To address the comment:<br>Dear sir, I wish my drinks had arrived as quickly as your comment. I too am a Miami native and this is the first time a &#34;palmetto bug&#34; has ever fallen onto my dinner table. We couldn&#39;t be seated inside bc there was not enough room, so we were told that someone would come out with a flashlight, which never happened. Then the &#34;palmetto bug&#34; climbed onto one of the other guests at my table. The server was less than pleased that he got stuck with the 17 top and it showed when the birthday girl asked if the fish was fishy and he replied &#34;order something else.&#34; We didn&#39;t expect a discount on anything and if we did we would have asked for it. Our bill was over a grand, I&#39;m sure anything that you would have offered would have been minimal in comparison to the headache of this yelp review and the bad wom. Even after the fact you are still not taking responsibility and shifting blame.	0
Take RSVP people! No place is worth waiting for an hour for a table with no good answer from the hosts when you&#39;ll get seated! It&#39;s sardine-style seating, loud, smelly, your clothes will smell food for the day. I don&#39;t care how good or bad the food is, it&#39;s a lousy management, its outrageously disorganized!	0
I would like to add an update to my past review. After trying some of the different food they offer. My choice as the best Persian restaurant in town is Zaytoon. <br>The atmosphere is still the same which is why I won&#39;t give a 5-stars because for me, a restaurant is not only about the food but the atmosphere of the place as I said earlier.<br><br>Food 4.5/5: My past review was a 3.5/5 and I&#39;m giving them a +1 since my last review mainly because the food is good. Their Zereshk polo is excellent and they have good Kababs. Definitely a good place to eat some good food. Last but not least, the bread is a killer! You should definitely order some Kashke Bademjan with it!<br>Service 5/5: Really nothing to say about the service. The family is always here to make sure that you&#39;re doing good and you like the food. They&#39;re great people and that is why I will always support them when I&#39;m in Vegas. My past review was a 4 but I have to say that the service that you get here is higher than average!<br><br>Give it a try, you won&#39;t be disappointed.	1
I have been to many different locations and the food is not thesaurus. My food was not even edible. Will not be back.	0
me and my girl ordered the manly burger and when they brought it out, the size of the burger immediately fooled us because the patty was huge and filled us both up! i suggest the manly burger and their fries were great!! i don't usually eat ketchup but their ketchup recipe is amazing!!!! be careful it is very easy to miss this location on hollywood and vermont!	1
To be perfectly honest, I enjoy coming here for brunch and to people watch. Since they&#39;re right around the corner from a studio, you&#39;ll usually spot someone famous if you happen to be here at the right time. <br><br>But I digress...I was first drawn in by the fact that they have a large selection of cupcakes, of which, red velvet is my favorite. I&#39;ve tried a variety of their sandwiches, wraps, and salads. All of which are consistently good. <br><br>One of my favorite drinks to get is pineapple mint lemonade. It hits the spot on hot summer day. <br><br>Get here early, since it&#39;s a hot spot for brunch/lunch. You can either valet for parking, or find a spot in the neighborhood. But don&#39;t forget to read all the parking signs. YOU&#39;VE BEEN WARNED.	1
Okay-- to summarize:<br><br>- Great outdoor ambiance<br>- Fun electro music <br>- Good drinks<br>- Fun Bartenders<br>- Delicious Happy Hour (chicken wings, garlic wasabi fries!)<br>- Super close (to me)<br><br>I&#39;d like to think of this place as &#34;my local bar&#34; :p	1
The food is great, but their service is terrible. I&#39;ve gotten less than accommodating service the two times that I&#39;ve been here. <br><br>This time on a Monday morning we arrive 15 minutes before breakfast ends, they say we have to wait 15 minutes to be seated for lunch to start, and mind you there are plenty of tables. They only took about 7 min to seat us, but they werent serving breakfast anymore. I came for some breakfast food, not an expensive sandwich. And breakfast is supposedly served from 7-11. Not 7-10:45.<br><br>And a side note, they should open the darn patio seating. It&#39;s completely shaded and there&#39;s still another month or so before it gets too hot out.	0
Per some recommendations we tried the Fish w/ Bean Curd and Chicken w/ Small Pepper. They were great! Bit dissapointed with the Green Onion Pancake appetizer (have had better).	1
cobb salad was the worst thing ive ever had. lettuce was salty and the chicken and bacon were hard as rocks. the blue cheese was super salty. none of that went well together- it was gross. the gazpacho soup was watery and spicy and nasty, could finish more than a few bites of both. FREAKING GROSS FOOD! plus the staff are inattentive and the glasses are super dirty...told him about it and i got the same glass back without the dry lipstick all over...except it was still on the rim....wth....not rude but definitely made me feel bad that he had to get me a new glass...thats not how customers should feel fyi. the space was just not very nice...	0
Hickory burger and fries were amazing. The bread is nicely toasted (grilled) which adds so much to the burger. I like a lot of toppings on my burger, but this doesn&#39;t need them, They are that good!! Although I&#39;m not a fan of BBQ sauce (the hickory burger sauce has a sweetness to it), It was still delish. next time, I&#39;ll try the steak burger. Service was great (my ice tea was bottomless!) and I even took a piece of pie (banana cream) to go. Can&#39;t wait to go back!	1
I really like this place a lot but was really dissapointed in their management recently. I made a reservation on Monday, September 20 for my birthday celebation (about 10 guests). I spoke with them, told them I wanted to have a table outside on their incredible patio. No problem I was told. Everything was reconfirmed on Friday, September 24th; "no problem with a table outside for my party." Then when we get there on Saturday, 25th at 7 pm there is no table available outside. ("oh, we're so sorry." I was told in a total insincere way.) So we ate inside...which was not the same. I feel like I was treated badly...anyway...just wanted to let you know you can't always trust them with a reservation...	0
i was recommended the Canon Cocktail and have to say was very impressed. on a return visit i would probably stick to these. massive points for offering manhattan flights (rye/rum/scotch) and while good i was not blown away.	1
This place is undervalued! It's really good and very reasonably priced! Consistently good food!	1
Food was excellent. Tried multiple appetizers including charcuterie plays, foie gras  parfait, bone marrow, cheese plate. All were outstanding and prefect to share and enjoy with wine. Lobster Thermidor was heaven and Mac and cheese did not disappoint. Server was very friendly and helpful. Recommended a great wine that I would not have normally tried.	1
This is a great place to go for drinks with friends and appetizers. I've been here many times for just that and it would get an extra star if just that.	0
In the month of Dec '04 I took 3 friends there on 3 occasions.  Dinners were the best I have had since returning from France.  I think the owners make every effort to provide the best food available in the area.  Their wait staff is sophisticated and they do their best to make the dining experience memorable.  All 3 of my friends were totally impressed with the menu selections and overall atmosphere.	0
Fantastic pizza with a wonderful spicy oil to drizzle on top. Great salad too. Excellent service with fun atmosphere. Only downer was the special calamari appetizer we got talked into and did not enjoy. Bring cash... They don&#39;t take most cards. Dined on October 27th Marco. Would love to come again next trip to NYC.	1
Well people I can say I took one of my friend to Starbelly on Sunday thinking it would be a great first impression and well SO NOT THE FACT! There was no waiting in line got a seat right away by a very wonderful lady but then our waiter handsome but worthless honestly came over and ask what we would like to drink and well we both said coffee ,he said sure and also took our order . But then the fun started , After he brought the water I looked at my coffee cup and he said well its PRESSED coffee I said ok ,, well he left and then 15 minutes passed m and finally I ask the lady who sat us could we have coffee please she walked right up got the coffee and poured us two cups and it was wonderful , then another waiter came out brought our Pizza which was wonderful and then another waiter ask us if the pizza was ok ,, We said yes but this is the funny part OUR waiter we started with finally came around at the end ask us if everything was good I looked at him and said YES can we have the check , he said yes here u r and it was a pleasure .I laughed due to we saw him once and attitude the rest of the time from him which made our totally experience AWFUL so why bother trying being polite if your a jerk.. So starbelly please think about quality and not looks on the waiters ok !!! I left NO TIP! a Penny would be too much..	0
This is by far the worst treatment as a customer I have ever received in my life!Usually, I give workers in the food industry some breathing room because I work in the food industry as well and there can be bad days, but this is by far the worst treatment I have ever received as a customer.Service:First off, I walk in and they tell me to sit wherever they like. After that, I wasn't approached by any of the waiters for over 20 minutes. Once finally approached, I was handed a menu and left to look over it for another 10 minutes. As I turned around to grab someone's attention, I caught them playing on their phones and talking to each other. The waiter finally approached me and gave me good attention but seemed like he was a bit unfamiliar with the menu (more on this later). After eating, I turned around to grab the attention of the waiter to ask for my check. Sure enough, they were all back on their phones. I walked up for my check and left.Restaurant Atmosphere:The new remodeling of the space was nice. Nice wood finish on most of the inside. They had a projector of music videos being played but it would be stopped for minutes at a time creating very awkward moments of eating in silence. The screen itself was in a very awkward place where as you approach the cash register, it was blinding if you turned towards the right.Food:I went there for lunch time and the lunch menu included 6 wings (soy garlic flavored), potato wedges, a soda for $9.99. I also ordered a broccoli salad with my lunch combination at $5 and some change (i forgot the actual price). The order in which I received the wings first, soda, potato wedges, and lastly the broccoli salad. You would think that the first things to come out would be the ones you don't actually cook. They gave me about 6 wings with the soy garlic flavored but they were tiny, but that's what kyochon is known for. Wings that are tiny and will not fill you up unless you eat 100 of them. The potato wedges were a bit bland and the broccoli salad was pretty good. I got the dressing on the side because it it very strong and it could definitely overpower the food itself but the worst of all was the hair that I found in my broccoli salad. The staff didn't care at all and I went on my way.Overall: the service is the worst that I have ever received. The food was mediocre at best since the wings are tiny and the broccoli salad had a hair inside of it. There are plenty of other wing places in LA that have better service, better food, and better portions. I am most def not coming back to this establishment.	0
I love their champagne special on Sundays!! You can&#39;t beat $12 for a bottle of champagne and an amazing view. The service can vary depending who waits on you, but overall everyone is nice and happy. Their desserts are the bomb! I&#39;ve been here tons of times, but never had any food except the sliders. The one time we did want to order food we waited 45 minutes!!! The bartendar that took our food order didn&#39;t put it in!	1
Noah's has been a staple of Bremerton for decades. There is definitely a reason why. They are a great burger joint.	1
Love it here!!!	0
Every dish is delicious! Especially love the caprese salad and rice balls as appetizers!	1
Generous portions and friendly service! <br>While I was there, two people tried to dine and dash and the waitresses chased them down outside, but was very courteous!<br><br>They have a lot of dishes that you probably won&#39;t find anywhere else, especially not at any Mongolian BBQ spots. Family run and authentic. <br><br>Tried the handmade noodles and it was bomb! Also got the beef dumplings with sour cream dip and that also tasted pretty good, although it was more subtle/mild so I added some hot sauce. <br><br>Would definitely come back again to try more dishes!	1
I don;t think the problem with Momofuku Ssam Bar is that they are calling this traditional korean style &#39;ssam&#39; a burrito because it is in fact their twist of a burrito. The Original Momofuku Ssam = A triple oily, poorly put together and not so tasty one. You can definitely taste that sweet fish sauce. All the ingredients were sort of stuffed in different sections so it was hard to get a taste of everything in one bite. Do they always do that? They should put all that shredded goodness, mix it in a pot and for chrissake&#39;s please hold all the massive grease! By the end.. I used a fork to pick at it. Although I did agree that the $10 price is great for the huge size of that one burrito at this place. You may look like a cheapo at dinnertime ordering their pre-made ssam as your entree but if you were dying to try it like I was.. who cares. Hitachino Red and White Ale available.<br>Too dark in there. Waiters who obviously favor the big spenders. Ridiculous bar (it was a square block table) waiting area near the kitchen. Sitting at the long bar looked cool though. Table service was not worth it.. the only good point was that they had plenty of loose napkins on the table to wipe your GREASY ass hands.<br>The steamed pork buns as apps were quite delicious. I would go back for those babies.<br>That is all.	0
Just happened to be walking down the street and stopped for a frozen custard. It was okay, portion size was good, just nothing amazing about it.	0
The fries were the highlight. I think the quality of the beef is too low to contribute to the taste of the burger hence the amount of sauce used is way out of balance and dominates the flavor. I liked the patty size options the theme of the joint the location and the milkshake but ultimately the cost/value ratio was totally out of whack. Probably would not return at those prices.	0
Thanks to Yelp we came to this joint for lunch since I wanted to go to the Team LA store a few minutes drive away. I parked my car next to the place which had $9 weekend rate parking. We had to wait a little over five minutes to wait. It was worth it. I ordered the chicken panini. Very good choice! It came with house chips that were also good. There is very limited booth seating indoors and there are a good amount of outdoor seating. The restroom is hidden in the parking garage and you will need a token to go inside.	1
Tried the Bentley, tomato soup and chocolate chip cookies. All were excellent.<br><br>One thing to note is this place is more of a casual fast food place. So it is a little pricey but I do think that it is worth the money. Highly recommend the Bentley and getting their chocolate chip cookies, which I think might be among the best I&#39;ve ever had. The soup was ok but I&#39;d take the house chips over the soup as a side as they were much more memorable.	1
Great cafe with a beautifully modern and eclectic ambience. This is a great place to sit and study or work with a delicious chai or espresso. Be aware though, there are designated "laptop free" and "study free" tables. These are tables in which the use of laptops or individual studying is not allowed. Although it may seem contrary to what one might expect from a cafe, when I asked one of the baristas they explained that it was put in place by the owner to encourage more face to face interactions while in the cafe. When you put it that way, it doesn't seem so bad. In addition, there are plenty tables and seating for those would like to study and use laptops. Seating and table restrictions aside, this is a great cafe this take great care in preparing the perfect drink for every customer in addition to the delicious foods and pastries to pair. You may pay a bit more than your local Starbucks but it's definitely well worth it!	1
Never would I have imagined myself writing a yelp review complaining about a restaurant but thought the need to after receiving the worst customer service of my life at this place. <br><br>My friend and I came in around 1:30pm on Saturday, waited about 30 minutes and got seated. We didn&#39;t get our water until 20 minutes in, finally having to ask the waitress for it. No one came by to ask how things were--okay whatever, it&#39;s Saturday brunch in NYC. It&#39;s busy, we get it. But you can clearly see the servers just chilling on the side together, sipping on coffee, chit-chatting. It was pretty hard to get their attention. We got our food on a decent pace (thank yous to the kitchen!) and almost took 10 minutes to get a server by us to ask for the check. After paying, one of the girls came by and asked if everything was okay and how service was. We told her honestly saying that it was pretty slow. She responded saying that it IS Saturday and brunch time. My friend mentioned some of the servers talking, standing, drinking coffee on the side. She says &#34;okay&#34; and walks away. When she came back to drop off our change, she states &#34;why don&#39;t you guys try being on your feet for 9 hours&#34; in the nastiest and rudest tone of voice ever. The more ironic thing is I&#39;m a server myself and the friend I came with is a cook at a very fast-paced restaurant. <br><br>Food was nothing more than mediocre. I&#39;ve had much better avocado toast at Joseph Leonard. Baked eggs with sausage were too overcooked in our opinion. Smoked trout salad was bland. Definitely not worth a second visit especially with the service from hell.	0
Definitely the WORST restaurant experience I&#39;ve EVER had!!! I really doubt the credibility of the reviews here. I&#39;ve never rated any restaurant lower than 4-star before.<br><br>It is only a little restaurant with edible food and horrible service. <br><br>We got the seats really fast because there was no waiting line. And then we were served 40 minutes later! We did ask for the waiter and he kind of ignored us for a very long time. I couldn&#39;t believe that they served the group behind us! Then we got our food 30 minutes later than that. THEN! We got the wrong food. <br><br>Seriously, just don&#39;t risk your mood or vacation in this place!	0
Meh. Wasn't horrible, but I won't be back.	0
great food, good service, priced right. We enjoy the atmosphere each time we go thereand we only need to pay 1/2 price points on Wednesday!!	1
One of the best in Madtown.	0
just got done eating there. waitress was a bit rude said herself that she was unfamiliar with the menu and misquoted the price of the margaritas during happy hour as 2.75 but on our bill they were 3.50. when i asked about it we were told that she had made a mistake sorry. that's all. she was now gone and this was a gentleman. I feel we should have had our bill reduced don't you ?	0
Complete gem...hidden in a shopping center!! My new husband and I stopped here after our flight into Miami for a quick dinner. We had no idea how amazing this food was going to be. <br>The service was beyond attentive and the food was so good that we both stuffed ourselves beyond capacity.<br>We started with the Zuppa di Vongole: Clams with roasted garlic, herbs, and white wine. I cannot say enough how much we loved that broth!<br>I had the Rigatoni Anacapri with prosciutto, onions, and famous pink creamy sauce...phenomenal!<br>My husband had the Pollo alla Parmigiana Breaded chicken breast with San Marzano tomatoes and melted mozzarella (chicken parm) which was really good as well.<br>From my past experiences, some of the very best family restaurants are in deceiving strip malls...this one fits that bill.<br>If I ever fly into Miami and have to stay near the airport again I will return to this restaurant for sure!	1
Like everyone else on here seems to be saying; great food served wicked late, well-chosen beers, and nice cocktails. Service is solid and good; words I chose carefully because one time it was warm, spectacular service that made me feel as if I&#39;d lucked into my new favorite place in the city, while another time it was perfectly adequate with nothing particularly warm about it but no mistakes. Whatever, I don&#39;t need my hand held every second!<br>So far I tried the putine which was exactly what my tipsy self needed, fried pickles which were a huge order and tasty, and the seasonal burger which was messy but absolutely delicious (at the time the seasonal burger had creamed spinach &amp; mascarpone on it).<br>The beers are great even though I&#39;d prefer something that doesn&#39;t expand my midsection as quickly as it does. With that burger I had a bitter, a saison, and a summer ale. Definitely worth a visit!<br><br>CASH ONLY	1
Ella's Deli is too close to my house not to go there. I don't see myself ever being a regular, but it's a fantastic place for kids. it keeps them busy and even gets them to eat a little. Ella's needs some major improvements in their food selection. we have bought their ice-cream multiple times and wereways happy with it. When I finally took my niece there to look at all the amazing decor they have, we decided to give their food a try and it was not impressive at all. we tried their hot dogs and fries, a Ruben and coleslaw and a soup. all of which were bland and happily forgettable. We still left the place with a smile as my niece loved everything she saw there, and ate some of her food even though she didn't like it just to stay there a bit longer.	0
Everytime I am in Vegas I go here and its always outstanding every single time	1
The food was good, nice portions and the chef's preparation of our food right in front of us was great! Our server was very attentive, helpful and friendly. Was pleasantly surprised to see Benihana's located in a village-type setting with restaurant on  different levels. Would recommend as we would definitely return.	1
All talk! They do not care if they do not get your business!	0
Been here about 5 times and the two times I&#39;m here I ordered my Karaage Chicken SUPER GREASY and I mention it to the server then she said no it is the salad dressing and the chicken suppose to be GREASY NOT CRUNCHY! I was politely ask to fix my Karaage issues but she come back with the same chicken saying I will just take it off the check instead of fixing it correctly!!! The owner is not here by the way!!! VERY DISAPPOINTING, NOT SURE IF IM GOING TO RETURN TO THIS PLACE AGAIN!!!	0
I was really excited to come here, so much that I brought 3 co-workers. The food is good, but not good enough that poor management is completely overlooked. They were out of every variety of coleslaw except for some sub-par bruschetta, and also out of green bean fries at 1:00 on a thursday afternoon. Forgot our drinks, credit card machine was down... Whatever, this can be overlooked - I open up my box of 3 chicken strips, there were 2 and a little crumb. Getting a little frustrated at this point I asked for them to bring me the 3 strips that I ordered - dude comes out of the kitchen, tells me something about how the chicken is free-range and really expensive and refuses to do anything about me being unhappy.<br><br>Here&#39;s the deal dude - if you&#39;re doing a crap job of keeping your business basics together, at least appease the customers so they can leave happy. I won&#39;t come back to your restaurant not because the food isn&#39;t good, it&#39;s because you&#39;re a douche bag that told me about how the chicken is organic and expensive instead of just fixing the problem. Your rusty tables left orange marks all over my pants.	0
I love far bar.<br><br>I go here a lot. It just appeals to my sensibilities. Hip but not overbearingly annoying, quaint and quirky enough not to attract a huge crowd, with a small hide-away entrance that adds to the understated flair.<br><br>the food is very decent-- i think I&#39;ve tried most of the things on there, the bartenders are all very nice and personable, happy hour prices are very reasonable.<br><br>the music when i went is mostly very good forward looking EDM.<br><br>try chicken wings - good<br><br>the sliders - good but overpriced<br><br>garlic fries - a must when watching the lakers	1
Was not impressed. Went there excited with some friends based on the 1000+ really good reviews and from hearing about it from friends. When we got there, there wasn&#39;t a wait which was nice. After we were seated, our service went downhill. Service was slow and the food was disappointing. The fried pig ears were too salty and mostly breading. We tried a caesar salad with a sardines and quail egg which would&#39;ve been ok if the dressing wasn&#39;t drowning the entire salad. the sardine was house cured and was pretty good, but wasn&#39;t enough to make our experience any better. After a dish was completely forgotten, we gave up and asked for the check. Our total was about $24 plus some change. My friend put down $40 and the exact change. The waitress opened up the check and saw the $40 and asked if we needed change. Does that mean she thinks she deserves a $16 tip for a $24 meal?? She saw that my friend left change and said that they don&#39;t accept change and that she would round down. When she finally came back with the change (I couldn&#39;t understand why everything took so long since it wasn&#39;t very busy), she had rounded up.<br><br>I had an overall great experience with the Chicago restaurant scene but The Purple Pig really stuck out to me as less than stellar.	0
Love this place it has multiple personalities so take this review with a grain of salt...<br><br>Weekdays/happy hour: chill spot, Kings of Leon-type of vibe, think LES creeping into Williamsburg with soho folk. I&#39;ll take it. Came here for a spanish-practice date with a classmate and really enjoyed playing hangman on the chalk board tables and another time with coworkers for after work brewskies. Both times we had tentative service and decently priced drinks and not a problem finding seating. Only problem was the arctic breeze that accompanied the booths on the right hand side of the bar.<br><br>Late night/weekends: This place starts to feel more lounge-y with a dj spinning everything from Amy Winehouse (RIP sister) to Outkast to Drake to The Cure. I like it. Keeps the super diverse crowd pleased and their buzz going. I appreciate that this bar has so many different &#34;places&#34; to hang around in, and that the bar is a legitimate place to post up and spend the night as the place is built around it. Getting in a game at the billiards table has never been a problem for me either. <br><br>You can easily dance the night away here, enjoy a beer after work, or meet some new people on a Friday night. It is a nice alternative to the massive crowd at Blackbird. Fingers crossed to hoping it lasts.	1
I really love this place at wynn and all vegas. So modern and chic. Service is very good and the food is more than excellent. I want to go back there!	1
The food was ok. But you gotta watch your $. These waiters will try to overcharge you in every way they can find. Don&#39;t leave your receipt cause the will give themselves a huge tip!!	0
Food was fantastic! Very Italian. Service was on point and not overbearing but kept us comfortable.	1
Ran in on my lunch hour. Asked for soup and salad to go. I dont mind paying $1100 dollars for lunch but I need more then a few bites. Soup was bland and the salad was ok. I wont go back.	0
So I know this place gets a little pricey but the service made my trip out to LA worthwhile. DO NOT GET THE TUNA MELT- I could have made this at home. It's literally bread, tuna, and cheese. However, I ordered it with a sweet potatoe fries w/ ranch on the side and it totally saved the meal. Our waiter was super hot and the manager came by to check up on me and my friend and gave us a free red velvet cupcake because it was her birthday. The cupcake was deliciousss!	1
If it ain't Ezells I don't want none!	1
I was not impressed by the customer service at this restaurant. As I asked Sarah ( who had just taken beers to another table) if I could get another beer... she looked at me with a rude look and said "you have to go get it yourself" I would think that the least she could do was ask a server "her coworker" if they could attend me, but turns out she couldn't. Then once she saw I was upset at her tone she proceeded to say "well since we're busy maybe you'd like a job" I am a customer!... I am not asking for anything free or discounts... Why is it so hard to receive decent service here. What a way to insult a customer! Anyways I would not return here anymore. The point of going to a restaurant is to enjoy the experience, however that was not the case. Thanks for everything.	0
Upon arrival, lunch reservations for 3 ppl not honored. Waiter seated walk-in party ahead of us and forced us to wait 15 minutes. As I type this, it&#39;s 20 minutes past our reservation time and still no waiter or silver or place setting. <br><br>Had to walk to server station to attract attention of server. Finally our server took order, but no silverware until AFTER food had arrived.<br><br>food quality was decent, but experience was irreparably harmed by lack of service. Disaster, followed by staff indifference. Do not waste your time with these amateurs.	0
Very good food. The potstickers in particular were outstanding. The only negative side to this place was our waitress. Houdini could've learned from her disappearing trick.	1
Fresh and healthy. Left very satisfied but not disgustingly full! Defiantly would come back!	1
Lovely spot, lots of promise. But despite ordering from every part of the menu, nearly every dish we had was served cold and with toast. The tartinettes are supposed to be like that, but when I order cod from a menu section called &#34;Poissons&#34; I sort of expect a warm piece of fish, not a cold jar of spread. This place must be raking in the $$ since every $15 dish is put together by putting a scoop of pre-prepared stuff on a couple pieces of toast. The fact that it&#39;s served cold and not even room temperature reminds you that it just came out of a refrigerator. Tastes pretty good for what it is, but come on!	0
Pan seared Watermelon steak is watermelon made to look like a steak. Did not know that and was very disappointing. Polenta Fries were bad but I've never had polenta before so many I just don't like polenta. Risotto was boring. Caesar salad was odd (Came with two full anchovies) but good. Fish taco was alright to good.	0
Pretty hard to find. The entrance is a little tiny gate in an alley with a banner hanging. I didn't think too much of it when I walked in but I was delightfully surprised. I really like this place a lot. It kinda feels like your in New York. We had wasabi fries, beer, hot sake and sushi rolls. All really good and decently priced. I must tell you about the wasabi fries. They're awesome. No seriously. It's a must have if you come here.Honestly you would probably never know about this place unless someone tells you about it. The reason we went is because my friend is a server there and I promised her I would go check it out. By no means am I only saying that the food and service was good because of her. Everything actually was. It wasn't packed at all but I came on a Tuesday. Apparently, they even have a DJ on the weekends and it gets pretty packed from what I hear. Definitely a nice place to check out if your in the area.Ohh one more review to go for my 100th. I wonder what it'll be...	1
Great place for an after-work meet up. Rooftop pool feels very LA, but in a good way, not pretentious and scene-y like others. Great food, though I wish the menu had more selections. Cozy fire pit area is intimate and romantic. Great views, great place to bring an out-of towner here on business.Service pretty slow, however, at least all the times I've been there. Forget it on a Friday night its so crowded and uncomfortable you'll want to jump off the side of the building. Overall, I dig. Oh, careful of the hotel valet. They're disorganized and pretty unprofessional. (but come on, they're valet people and I can't hold it against)	1
After a very unsatisfying delivery experience, the manager and owner both reached out to me immediately to resolve the situation. <br><br>Very impressed with their customer service and very excited to try their food at the Belmont location in Chicago. Cannot comment on the actual food yet, but from previous reviews and the outstanding customer service I received, I am sure it will be a very positive experience.	1
Consider this a 4.5 star review.<br><br>This is probably the best place to go if you can&#39;t decide what you want to eat because they have pretty much every kind of taco to hit those different tastebuds.<br><br>There is 21 tacos ranging from tikka chicken to bacon burger to Cuban pig. I am a regular here and have now tried every taco on the menu (besides the seafood category because of an allergy).<br><br>My standard order is three tacos, and usually I get tots on the side. This will easily last 1.5 meals. My favorites are the roast pork frittata/chilaquile #20 and the tikka chicken #3<br><br>The tots - let me put it this way - I don&#39;t even like tater tots, but I LOVE these fancy tots. The tots have so many fixings that it&#39;s like an explosion of salty, creamy, spicy, starchy. It&#39;s crazy.<br><br>I feel the same way about they&#39;re red velvet cake. Normally I despise red velvet but Velvet Taco just does it right, oh and if you&#39;re eating it without the butterscotch sauce you&#39;re doing it wrong. <br><br>Furthermore, the space is cool and the drinks are worth it.<br><br>Now, the only hold back I have from this rave is that the calamari taco my bf ate was no good he said. And on just a couple occasions my stuff came too wet (tots were oily and the tacos had too much sauce) BUT these are so minor and could happen anywhere that it&#39;s pretty much null.<br><br>So, the next time you are arguing about what to eat, remember me and just go here! In fact, just go here in general.	1
This is like pretty much my favorite place to eat in Miami. Every weekend after hanging at the Vagabond or on the beach I stroll down to the Gables and order a Pan Con Bistec at 4AM. It&#39;s super cheap and super freaking delicious. I actually had my birthday party there one year, there are a few tables outside in the back that accommodated my friends and we had steak sandwiches and cake after partying with Rusko at The White Room (Eve now). Also where else on the planet can you get a smoothie at three o&#39;clock in the morning?	1
So cute, I felt like I was walking into a crate and barrel commercial.<br><br>Whats up with the couches? Is redhook becoming Miami? And there was a mangy looking cat that appears to own the place, dont give him tips, he will just spend it on katnip!<br><br>the muscles were amazing. Served with a thin toast. Toast is usually delicious, but this stuff was mana.<br><br>Great place for a casual bite and some wine with friends, although it was date night city when I went...	1
Great location, great service and delicious meal!<br>Went with a colleague and friends and we ordered a couple pies and a couple salads- salads were fresh and flavorful. Pizza was so good and light.	1
Overpriced, horrible service, an undercooked burger brought to the table not as ordered, a 10 dollar burger portioned so small it should have been classified as a slider AND the next day everyone in my party has the runs! This place is as ridiculous as it gets. Our waiter was one of those well intentioned, super friendly LA. hipsters without a clue as to what service is about. He brought our drinks in bottles and neglected to bring glasses. Three attempts at asking for glasses with ice and all we got was "OK, sure I am getting those for you" only to get zip. When the food arrived my pork burger special was raw in the middle. When I was finally able to locate the waiter I sent it back only to be told it was cooked properly and didn't need further grilling. I guess getting a meal cooked the way you want it and not the way the cook wants to send it out to you is not possible at this place. Our waiter, not knowing what to do or say sent the manage over. A nice guy, he took my bad burger away and replaced it with another burger, this time cooked properly but not the burger I had ordered. On top of that, it had a strange and unfamiliar flavor that no burger should have. After leaving hungry, angry and price gouged we all spent the next day with stomach "issues". DON'T EAT HERE... it is wrong on so many levels, like food, service, price and portion size.	0
I went to street about a week ago and I must say the food was very good. My family and I ordered quite a bit off the menu and was NOT mad at all. The whole fish snapper, peri peri wings, curry chicken,Whole chicken, lamb was a bit bland but hey. sister finished off the octopus before I could even taste it ...so I guess it was alllllll good.Jerk Pork, shark and bake, hot dogs, corn soup and complimentary of the chef was the fried pork. Yes if you are west Indian you already know how this food could be taken up a notch but it was VERY good. I must say we were very pleased and wil be back. We didnt drink so I can&#39;t even talk about that but I will save that for the next visit. The staff was very nice,and Chef Roble was also there and stopped by the table to to let us know about a few more projects that he was working on.	1
Double-double animal style is delish. It always makes me wanting it first thing when on the west coast.<br><br>.. Too bad the one I had here in Vegas was dry, and tasted like crap. I was trying to imagine the time I had it in San Fran and was in burger heaven, but nope, crap.	0
I went here recently for a private family party. The party was fun, but the experience with the staff here was unpleasant, to say the least.<br><br>First off, when we got there half an hour early to set things up, as we were told to do, nothing was ready. Tables and chairs weren&#39;t set up until 5 to 10 minutes before our scheduled party was supposed to start. Guests were arriving and the staff was still moving things around. The hostess who met with us and was apparently our coordinator was flat out rude the entire time. We were nothing but nice and polite and she gave us a sour attitude and monotone answers to every question. We had brought flowers to decorate and another staff member who was supposed to be helping us out basically let the front door slam in my mother&#39;s face when she was carrying a box of flowers into the restaurant.<br><br>The upside was the food was pretty good and three of the food servers (two younger guys in their early 20s and an older woman) were very nice and helpful. The decor upstairs is nice. I liked all the photos of Cuba on the walls.<br><br>Wrapping up the party, the same rude hostess made us wait another half hour for the extra food we had already paid for, even though we finished eating more than an hour before our party was scheduled to finish. When I asked the hostess about it, she was rude, as normal. I&#39;ve become used to restaurant staff in Miami restaurants being cold and impolite, but this lady was one of the worst I&#39;d ever come in contact with. Should customers really be treated like an inconvenience? Needless to say, the 3 nice servers got an extra tip and the rude hostess did not. <br><br>I wouldn&#39;t recommend this place to host a private party and I don&#39;t plan on eating here again when I visit family in Miami. I&#39;d rather go to Sergio&#39;s or even La Carreta. The food is just as good and the service at those places has always been better.<br><br>Oh, and they stole all of our pens.	0
Go here before this place blows up. It&#39;s amazing. Went for the $10 for $20 deal, and every single thing we ordered was phenomenal. I got the chicken sandwich (with lots of help from the incredibly nice waiter) and my girlfriend got the ropa vieja sandwich. I also tried the mango shake (TWO THUMBS UP!) and we got sweet plantains too. The neighborhood is low key, the food and service are spectacular. Check this place out ASAP.	1
The LA location is major disappointment for the Keizo Shimamoto brand. I experienced the "original" ramen burger at the NYC Manhattan location a few months back and was positively impressed, leaving me a fan. I was really looking forward to introducing a friend to the concept at the LA location, but walked away completely disappointed. I ordered the spicy version, which supposedly comes with sriracha in the secret sauce. The burger I received had barely, if any sauce on it, the beef patty was dry and there were vague traces of something resembling spiciness. The ramen buns were crispy and adequately cooked, but overall the concoction failed because, like any burger, it is "made" by the juiciness of its middle.The differences with its NYC siblings extend to more than the meal. While the Manhattan restaurant has a modern decor with a chic vibe, in LA you are served from a hole-in-the-wall next to a nightclub on a busy major street. This may help sales, especially late at night on weekends, but for those seeking the culinary experience, the noisy and grimy setting, with two tiny tables only one of which has chairs, is an instant turnoff. And you can pretty much forget about parking nearby.Due to this lousy experience, I have no intention of revisiting the LA location - the brand's reputation has been permanently tarnished for me. Maybe I'll try it again in Brooklyn. Or maybe not.	0
I had been sorely disappointed by the food in Miami, but the saving grace was this counter spot in Little Havana. Friendly chef, good moist roast chicken with plantains and rice. Generous portions. Forget the other places.	1
Amazing!! Their fried pickles are delicious!	1
Deeeeeeelicious! I came here with my parents for my birthday and we had a lovely time. We came on a Sunday and one of us got the prefix menu (we all tasted and loved it), another one of us had the steak, and i had the macaroni and cheese with a side of green beans. Aside from the delicious food, the service was exceptional and the wine I had (a cap franc) was full bodied with an incredible flavor. I ordered some sort of chocolate coffee mousse for dessert and savored every bite. The ambiance is casual-dressy, the space is charming, and the staff is friendly. I can't wait to go back!	1
Food/Taste: 5 stars<br>Service: 5 stars (fast, friendly)<br>Parking: street parking, not difficult to find.<br><br>My boyfriend took me here for dinner on a Sunday night, and the place was poppin&#39; till closing. We were lucky enough to be able to sit in 1 of 3 booths with draping curtains on the sides--the atmosphere was quite romantic, I must say :) -- dim lights and candles on the tables.<br><br>Here&#39;s what we ordered: <br><br>1) &#34;Tasty Burger&#34; Meyer&#39;s Ranch Beef Patty Grilled with French Fries: We preferred the patty to be medium rare, but our server suggest we get medium, and it was perfectly cooked-- Still tender. The vegetables were fresh and crispy, and even the french fries were perfect (when it was still hot). <br><br>2) Braised Boneless Short Ribs with Garlic Mashed Potatoes, Kale and a Red Wine Jus: Ohhh just thinking about it makes me hungry again. I didn&#39;t know short ribs could be so tender! I must say though, the flavor was a bit on the salty side, but luckily, the mashed potatoes made up for it.<br><br>3) Make Your Own S&#39;mores - Molten Marshmallow, Bittersweet Chocolate, and House Made Graham Cookies [for dessert]: OMG *droool* My boyfriend actually heard about this dessert before, that it is one of those things You Must Try. I don&#39;t even know where to start. It came in cute little cups (one with dark bitter chocolate, and the other with melted marshmallows) with candles on the bottom to keep them warm. You just gotta see it for yourself and taste the orgasmic sensation in your mouth!<br><br>Approx. total for these dishes: $45, an excellent value!<br><br>I would definitely go again to try more dishes!	1
Came here already eating pork the last 2 days. So when we got here, tried to vary it up. At first, I told the server I wanted the 8 sauces combo. He says yes and proceeds to say it would be for the 2 people combo. I assumed that i had ordered the 8 sauces...then our order comes out, and none of the pork belly with the sauces come out. I was frustrated and told the young guy, but he brushed it off by saying he thought we said otherwise. I even showed him my coupon! Which i had gotten about a yr ago for a &#34;special treat.&#34; Turns out that treat was included in the 8 sauces combo. Thanks, dude.<br><br>Anyway, we had beef and pork neck/belly without the 8 sauces. The meats were all right. There are plenty other kbbq places that taste better, i wasn&#39;t impressed. I&#39;ll give this place another shot so hopefully they&#39;ll get my order right. But for now food and service was so so.	0
If I want a well done burger give me a well done burger! When I ordered a burger well done the female cashier had a grin on her face and told me the well done burgers don&#39;t taste good here so I should order it medium or medium well. I took her suggestion and ordered it medium well and sure enough I get a bloody red undercooked burger. I should have read Yelp reviews before I came here because other people are having similar issues.	0
I was so excited when The Double Windsor opened up in the neighborhood and have had a number of good experiences there over the years. However, the last few times I went, the bartenders were HORRIBLE! (the guy bartenders!!, I&#39;ve never had a problem with the female bartenders). They act as though they&#39;re doing you a favor for just doing their job. I once stood with a friend at the bar for about 15 minutes waiting to be served. There were 2 bartenders working. One was taking care of other customers and the other was updating the chalkboard with not a care in the world that there were bar guests waiting to be served (we weren&#39;t the only ones waiting). Finally, as the one guy continued to take his merry old time updating the chalk board (not a priority, in my opinion, when there are guests waiting to be served), the other bartender finally came over to us, was not pleasant whatsoever, a barely mumbled &#34;What can I get you&#34; in a most arrogant way. We were so annoyed with the attitude, that we just left and went across the street to Farrell&#39;s where we were promptly served with a smile. They might not have the beer selection that DW has, but at least their bar staff are attentive and not arrogant.<br><br>Another time I was there with a couple of friends late on a Thursday night. We stayed pretty late, but it was not past the closing time. The bartender clearly wanted to close the place and was going around and removing the candles from all the tables. We were one of a few tables left and we asked if we could keep the candle on the table because it&#39;s quite dim in there, and we even said we&#39;ll bring the candle up to the bar when we leave. But the bastard of a bartender said no and took the candle off our table! I can see if it was past closing time, but the bar WAS STILL OPEN!! <br><br>This is going back a bit, but really bothered me enough to include it in this review. During World Cup, they had a sign outside inviting people to come in and watch the World Cup. It was USA v. Ghana and the bar was definitely more crowded because of people wanting to watch the game. They had the TV on and when the game was about to start, I asked when they were going to turn on the volume. The bartender told me that they were not going to turn on volume to the game per the Manager of the bar. I was outraged because I specifically went there to watch the game because they were allegedly showing the game. I feel like they totally lied to get people in the bar, which is NOT COOL.<br><br>I was going to give this 2 stars because the food is pretty good and they have a nice beer selection, but its their HORRIBLE BARTENDERS that led me to give it just one star. STOP HIRING JERKS FOR BARTENDERS!	0
Disappointing to say the least... the bistro burger was overdone, flavorless and the bun fell apart in my hands as I ate. Of course the service and ambiance were poor, and although I think some people like that atmosphere, we didn&#39;t go for it. Too bad because I remember liking this place much more on previous visits.	0
Horrible service and disregard for customers. Awful music in the evening.	0
You&#39;d think a restaurant that moved into this neighborhood and is doing well would do more to help the community it serves. This restaurant moved in and along with it brought the loudest, most obnoxious vent with it. The vent is so loud you can hear it two blocks away and owners refuse to fix it even when it affects the lives and work of people who live nearby. I was once a customer, now I&#39;m not and I will urge everyone to not patronize them until they fix their nasty noisy vent. Good food should also come with benefiting not hurting the neighborhood they serve.	0
Bardot Brasserie was fantastic!  Great service (after a delay in getting seated).  The food was wonderful.  The restaurant is beautiful.  I hope to go back for dinner or maybe happy hour.	1
This place is great for to-go vegan/vegetarian/health conscious food. It&#39;s nothing fancy, don&#39;t expect any impressive decor/ambiance. The space is pretty small and stuffy, but seems clean. I&#39;ve only had the club sandwich and falafel wrap, and those were delicious. I love that the salad comes with quinoa. Dressing is quite strong, but it&#39;s delicious so whatever. I&#39;m sad to see the 1star review stating that she got sick from their food and that they copied their entire menu from Golden Mean... It sucks that you got sick, but you can&#39;t say that they copied everything from another restaurant based on the fact that the two restaurants have the same items. Maybe they did, maybe they didn&#39;t I don&#39;t know since I&#39;m not affiliated with the business but I&#39;d just like to make my statement in their defense. I mean, how much &#34;different&#34; can 2 vegan restaurants be? Especially when it comes down to a club sandwich? Club sandwiches in general, vegan or not, aren&#39;t too &#34;diverse&#34;. Of course everyone loves a unique spot, and I sure do, but this spot is unique in that they serve vegan options at all in this area/location. Plus their prices are very competitive considering the fact that they are &#34;health conscious&#34;. I&#39;ve been to tons of vegan/vegetarian/raw/gluten-free/health conscious restaurants (although I am no longer vegan, but I was for 5 years), including Golden Mean and others in Santa Monica, and this place is not that bad. It&#39;s actually pretty good. I can&#39;t say I haven&#39;t had better, but the price is right and I haven&#39;t had bad service yet so I&#39;m pretty happy with the Grain Cafe.	1
This place is iconic and every time I go here it just brings an &#34;old school&#34; type of feeling that I really do enjoy. Food is a classic jewish deli and diner food that you can&#39;t really find anywhere else. It&#39;s delicious, good, not quite good for those who are trying to be on a diet. <br><br>I haven&#39;t tried the Matzo ball soup yet-----but I will next time!	1
I love SERIOUS PIE!	1
i came here for some guacomole and nachos, I left with two tacos, a flan, a seperate order of beef nachos, and a container of guap and chips. They were all great, large portions and well priced. will come back for more	1
BBQ chicken salad was soggy with no flavor. Use to love this place. Cheesecake has lost flavor and is too sugary now instead of densely flavored. Very disappointed	0
Not really clear why the hipsters have such affection for this grease pit, aside from the fact that its open late, and in a great location. The food's alright, but nothing special, and overpriced for what you get.	0
Very disappointing. Incredibly rude staff and mediocre food. My husband and I Have been a few times and we always expect a better experience but We always leave disappointed. I won&#39;t be back.	0
We searched Yelp for a good place in Madison to eat on the first night of our honeymoon. We chose Inka Heritage because of it's uniqueness - Peruvian food? Okay! It was the best decision ever. We wanted a place where we wouldn't look out of place in nicer clothes - the clean atmosphere and pretty place settings gave us the environment we wanted. We ordered the ceviche mixto to start and loved it. The seafood was fresh and the variety was even. The sauce was lime-y, spicy and complex. And the hominy and sweet potato on the side were great. Big yum. For the main meal, we shared the Manchupiccu and the Arroz Verde...Notendo (?). Both were amazing. The Manchupiccu was super savory and unique. The Arrozo was hearty, with a good amount of rice, and had a large portion of the seafood. Beautiful presentation on both and wonderful flavor. We got the Tres Leches for dessert - another success. Add the nicer atmosphere and our fantastic food to the attentive and friendly service we received and you get one suberb dining experience. Absolutely give this place a try!	1
You had better plan to be able to take the afternoon off from the office. We have been here for over 40 minutes and all we have are our drinks and attitude from the bar wench when we inquired to the whereabouts or our order.	0
We were in Venice this past autumn and after hearing about Cicchetti were excited to try it. We found a table upstairs and while it must have been one of the quieter spots in the place it was still loud. To the point that most every word spoken to our party of three was followed by a loud WHAT? And no we're not all hard of hearing.	0
I love their umami burger it is fresh and their sauce is awesome only thing is he parking I don't rally like the fact that I have to pay for the parking	1
I went here often when I was very young; it was near both my mom and dad&#39;s offices. I completely forgot about it, and didn&#39;t head back until one night leaving the Edison with a bunch of very hungry friends. Now I&#39;m regretting those lost years. The pancakes are fluffy, thick, and already a tad sweet. Just a bit of butter is enough, and they melt in your mouth.The eggs are perfect greasy spoon style, with fresh sourdough bread. I could eat breakfast here anytime(at any hour). It&#39;s the perfect compliment to the up-and-coming nightlife scene downtown because, as everyone else has noted, it&#39;s never closed.<br>Haven&#39;t tried any of the lunch style items other than the fries, so can&#39;t comment there.	1
The event was my 2-year anniversary with my lovely girlfriend Mel L.The Ambiance & Decor Grade: A-Are they going for a romantically lit cafe? A rustic bustling bar? I don't know, but it sets the mood for some fine dining. The place is lined with bottles of liquor throughout and the hanging lights give the place a warm atmosphere. I can do without the brick floor which made my chair rock a bit while I ate.Service Grade: A+I made reservations 2 months in advance so we were seated immediately after telling the hostess we preferred a window seat. Our waitress Holly gave her recommendations and insight on the food and was friendly and attentive all night. Our waters were always refilled without us asking. Similarly our bread was replaced once without us saying anything and subsequently we were asked if we wanted more. I just felt like everyone was there to make sure we were satisfied and that really made the experience memorable.Food Grade: A+Absolutely divine. I think this is how Napoleon ate- like a damn king. The Beef Bone Marrow was rich, savory, and I'm salivating just thinking about it. The bread they give you to eat with had a wonderful buttery crunch and the pickled garnish was good as well. My girlfriend's Escargot Pastries were AWESOME! The outer layer was buttery and flaky while the escargot on the inside was tender and beautifully seasoned with wine and pesto. My Braised Pork Belly pretty much blew my mind. It has this lovely crispy char on the outside while being fatty, juicy, and soft on the inside. The tree ear mushrooms they use had a lovely crunch and the starchiness of the fingerling potatoes helped absorb some of the fat. My only complaint is that the pork was a TAD BIT too salty, but I think I was just thirsty. My girlfriend had the Lingcod and the fish itself was clean and well seasoned. The dish also came with this fried fish-hash brown and that was really flavorful and enjoyable to eat as well. NOTHING WE ORDERED DISAPPOINTED. Lastly we got the Creme Brulee for dessert and as expected it was heavenly. They brought it out on this cute "Happy Anniversary" thing because of the note I left on my reservation, it was thoughtful.Conclusion & Price Grade: AIf you want to be treated and fed like a king, then you should expect to pay a bill worthy of someone who makes as much money as a king. The beautiful part is that I did not regret paying an arm and a leg to eat here. Church & State was worth every penny for this particular experience. Unlike Animal which was over-hyped for me, Church & State delivered on every level of satisfaction. This is where all the rich and beautiful people go. Join them. You're welcome.There is parking across the street for $5 flat.	1
I love the MAC AND CHEESE at the Old Fashioned! Nowhere can beat it!	0
Happy hour is from 3pm-7pm everyday,only have brunch at Saturday and Sunday,super nice view of sunset of Los Angeles ,food is good,I love the fried and burger ,small swimming pool on the roof can enjoy the sunshine and cocktail in the same time. During happy hour all the cocktails will be 7 dollar.have free wifi but need to became a member first .	1
Food is amazing!	1
Pluses: Great food.	1
The bad: parking can be a bit of a pain if you come at the wrong time. They&#39;re closed on Mondays (somehow I&#39;ve been foiled by this on many occasions..). Again, visiting at the wrong time... you&#39;ll find yourself waiting for a seat (delaying the deliciousness that you so desperately crave), hoping that everyone is honest and the first-come rule is followed by all. But like all good things, Apple Pan is worth the wait.<br><br>The good: The burgers, sandwiches, fries, and pies! Oh wait, that&#39;s everything on the menu! <br><br>Years and years ago, when I was just a naive freshman at ucla, I was waiting at the mall to get picked up. I was enjoying some McDonald&#39;s fries, when an older gentleman said my fries were trash and said that if I wanted really good food, then next time I&#39;d go across the street to the Apple Pan (this was before the days of yelp, hmmm, I think I&#39;ve really just dated myself). So I made the effort to go back to the Apple Pan. What a wonderful, life altering decision! The U-shaped counter, old-timey cash register, and old men hustling and bustling around add to the charm. The hickory burger is my favorite and I love the fat fries. No one I&#39;ve taken here has been disappointed. <br><br>Lastly, don&#39;t forget dessert! There&#39;s always room for homemade pie. Apple pie with ice cream?! Yes please! But the pie that changed my life is the boysenberry cream. Don&#39;t get me wrong, the banana cream, chocolate, strawberry, etc. are all good and I&#39;ve ordered many pies to go (for parties and such...no, not just for my own greedy obsession)....but I&#39;ll never forget that heavenly boysenberry cream pie.	1
Went to see a movie the other night at the Arclight theater and was looking for a spot to grub beforehand that was within walking distance. I actually started a talk thread and a fellow yelper suggested Bowery. I checked out some of the reviews and quick tips and decided to give it a shot and SWEET BABY JESUS!!! it was the most scrumptious decision I had made all week!!! I started off w/ sweet corn and crab fritters(delicious), gravy fries(the gravy is made with shredded pieces of short ribs and the flavor is incredible), both these appetizers paired perfectly with the Stone IPA&#39;s I was ordering up(all their beers are in bottles or cans none on tap). The meatloaf was the surprise star of the meal for me. I was gonna order the Bowery burger but the waiter totally sold me on the meatloaf when he explained that it wad made of veal,sirloin,and pork, w/ a bacon crust. Served with broccolini that was seasoned and cooked perfectly and delicious mashed potatoes. But back to the meatloaf, the flavors of all the delicious cuts of meats blended together perfectly and danced across my palette with a ballet of flavor!!! Service was great and prompt(from both the girl at the door to our waiter who was more than helpful with suggestions and prompt with food and drinks. I can&#39;t wait to come back again!!!	1
I went in here recently and when I came out my clothes reeked of greasey food. It was pretty disgusting. I had to air out my leather jacket out for a week until the stench finally went away. I really don't get this place. Why is everyone waiting in line????	0
My first time at the Six will not be my last... Started with the White Corn soup... OMG... it smelled as good as it tasted.. then the Heirloom Tomato Salad and the Marinated Beets.. so fresh, light and yummy... then the Grilled Salmon...Everything was Great the staff were attentive and the ambiance really nice... definitely recommend and can't wait to try the Burger which looked amazing...	1
I went with two more friends ; who are from Bulgaria and I MexicanoIt's been a long time since I eat Paella and what I was looking for it : was a great dishFlavor and the fried goat cheese !!!!Thank you for thatAJ MORENO	1
Awesome experience. I don&#39;t know which was better, the staff &amp; service or the food... everything was great. and affordable. best pizza and wings I have had in a long time	1
The majority of Chinese restaurants in my proximity had bad reviews. I was starting to think that I&#39;d never find a good Chinese restaurant to order from. I received a flyer for Chun Fai in my mail box so I decided to check them out online. I was pleasantly surprised to see good reviews so I called and placed my order. <br><br>The girl on the phone was very friendly and polite, she told me delivery would be 45 minutes, and took my card info to run my card. <br><br>Items ordered:<br><br>-Broccoli Beef ($8.75)<br>-Vegetable chow mein ($6.50)<br>-Crab rangoons (Free w/order)<br><br>My food was delivered in under 45 minutes and the delivery driver was really nice. There is a $2 fee for delivery, so my order came in at under $18 which wasn&#39;t bad at all. The broccoli beef came with a small order of white rice. Portions were big, it was enough to feed my two boys and myself, we still had leftovers for the next day. All the food was pretty good, I really enjoyed the chow mein, it had tons of veggies in it. The broccoli beef has carrots in it and the sauce it was in had a good flavor to it. The white rice was plain but did come with soy sauce. Two fortune cookies were included in my order. <br><br>Overall, I was really pleased. Portions and price are great, employees are friendly, delivery is fast, food is good. I&#39;ll definitely continue ordering from Chun Fai whenever I want good Chinese food without having to drive.	1
Second and last time for me.<br>First time was after a night of clubbing and anything taste good after that.<br><br>This time I was sober and had a Groupon, we both ordered the Pastrami. If you love fatty meat, then this is for you. Service was fast because it was empty and waitress Debbie had no charisma. I&#39;m not sure why I left a 25% tip but I did. We only ate half and took the rest home.<br><br>To me, there is nothing really special about this place -- it&#39;s an over-priced, dark diner.	0
I came here for brunch, it&#39;s in a very quite and cute neighborhood, it&#39;s a great spot for outdoor eating. However, the food itself is very typical and boring brunch food, nothing to write home about or worth going to again.	0
me and my boyfriend had the worst experience ever. i am from the us, but living in buenos aires, so we had our argentinian driving license, which for some reason works to rent a car, but they wouldn t let us buy a beer. i looked it up and there is no miami law that says that a foreigner license can t be accepted. unfortunately there s no law against discrimination<br><br> on top of that they said it in a really rude way and pretended they didn t understand our english. we&#39;ve lived in ny for a year, and have travelled everywhere because of our jobs, we have gone out to the coolest parties and bars before and had never suffered from discrimination.<br><br>Reponse to owner:<br><br>Weird that you seem to be the only bar in Miami following that law.<br>Anyways, upsetting that Miami laws only consider US states valid states. A city with the ammount of turist Miami has discriminating against our ID&#39;s, absurd. Who in their fair judgmenet would go partying with a passport?<br><br>Even if this was a law, which I still have my doubts your bartenders and managers were rude to us pretending they couldn t understand us and saying we weren t worth talking to and this is what this bad review is about. <br><br>One thing I also find annothing: What s the point of mentioning that people who work at the bar have Colombian and Guatemalean descendence? Why do americans feel that every latin speaking country have a bound or are similar in a way? Argentinians certainly don t have nothing to do with Colombian or Guatemalean culture, we are if anything more french or italian, that&#39;s where all atentinian inmigration comes from<br><br>You just owe us an apology dude, that&#39;s a little advice for you so you don&#39;t loose customers. is that so hard? Are we seriously the first foreigners who didn&#39;t &#39;t bring the passport to the bar?	0
It has been awhile since I have put out a review... I&#39;ve been to countless places and none feel worth mentioning whether it was good or bad...<br><br>But....<br><br>Yama-san... So Skillful...<br>Chisake-chan... So Attentive... <br>Yamakase... A Excellent Harmony...<br><br>Thank you... What a Delightful Experience... It has giving me the inspiration I need to do the simple task of simply typing a review which so many others failed to do...<br><br>What this was... I can&#39;t completely describe... I do know this though, It was purely blissful and delightful. Rest assured you have a pallet for beautiful, wondrous ingredients prepared with technique you shall be satisfied. <br><br>My dining experience of what I elegantly devoured can not be describe.. I am sorry for being unable to do so.. A wonderful euphoria of pleasure will put you in a state of a wonderful delirium that will cause you to lose track of what you ate... I&#39;d rather not even spoil the surprise... But that is impossible...<br>If you ever have the chance that you will state your case to be chosen, Then fate has something wonderful in-stored for you.<br><br>I will give you all one tip.. Please try a glass of red wine made by a friend of Yama-san. Its certainly a glass worthy of complimenting any of the World&#39;s Riches.<br><br>You coming here my cause you to tear like I did...	1
Don't like this place at all!!! 	0
This thanksgiving I&#39;m thankful for Petee&#39;s pie! Tried it first time on Thanksgiving day on their 2nd day of opening. Had a medley of 4 types of slices, everything was delicious. Filling was so soft and creamy, and those crusts, flaky, buttery, dreamy...	1
I like this place only because I discovered the most dangerous and best beer i've discovered in a while. It's called the Stoic and it's 11% alcohol by volume. Dangerous, dangerous drink, and oh did i mention it was dangerous?More info here: Love the high ceilings, and love that it's not too crowded when i come.	1
Good coffee, sandwich, cookies and fun staff. Sandwich came with a cookie instead of chips, and kind of pricey for amount of food ($11) , but strongly recommend stopping in here.	1
Very delicious sandwiches for sale here. This isn&#39;t your run of the mill sandwich shop as they have a bunch of cool different choices. The Asian roast pork is very tasty. You must try the fried chicken sandwich. The fries are also very good and served In the big Chinese take out cartons. Great spot to grab a sandwich.	1
2 complaints-I don't live in LA anymore so I don't get here often enough and I don't recommend eating inside when it's crowded, which is almost always...The place gets stinky and kind of dirty.... I much prefer sitting outside plus people watching is always the highlight.Super trendy, post partying Hollywood crowd. It gets crowded later in the morning and afternoon when everyone has finally woken up after a long night out partying. It's fun to see who looks the most hungover or still strung out...Anyway, the food is awesome. Doesn't really matter what you get. I'm a huge breakfast person so I almost always order breakfast food. And, yes, as with almost all other yelpers, you shouldn't leave without ordering a cupcake to go!	1
Of all the reviews we read, the bad ones about service turned to be accurate. We didnt get to order, so i&#39;m not sure if the food is good. We sat down. After a while we had to call someones attention. He said he only serve drinks but he will call our server. We got water... I could see three servers around but another 8 minutes passed and we left. Total of 15 minutes, 5 tables occupied 6-7 servers/ drink servers around. Am I wrong here?	0
Came here a month ago on a random Sunday. My girlfriends were around the corner from me and told me to meet up with them for Happy Hour. I heard Happy Hour and I was all game, right who would pass that up on a sunny Sunday? So they have me meet them here at Canter&#39;s. Huge sign in the front about their Happy Hour we walk inside and its a Restaurant. They lead us to the bar and it&#39;s completely empty. We all looked at each other and laughed out of desperation and just seated ourselves. Long story short the Happy Hour was alright 2-3 for a beer and they had food on the Happy Hour menu. Personally I don&#39;t like drinking while I eat so I did a pass. Maybe next time I&#39;ll go and eat instead of being a alcoholic and hitting the boring Happy Hour.	0
It&#39;s divey, a hole in the wall, and parking is a PAIN, but I loved every minute of it!!<br><br>Like the name say&#39;s, the featured item on the menu is CRAB, CRAB, and more CRAB. Alaskan King Crab, Dungenness, and Maryland Blue! All scrumptiously garlicky and finger licking AMAZING! If you&#39;re not into the frou-frou white tablecloths and dainty waiters, this is the place to go for CRAB!<br><br>I used to live down the street from the place many mango seasons ago, and never quite made it in there. Then one day out of the blue, I had a hankering. I asked my friends to join me and suddenly we were five people smacking crab with mallets. I tell you, the bibs are really needed here.<br><br>If you&#39;re not sure what to get, order the sampler platter. It comes with three (or four) varieties of crab and a couple of sides. Me being me, I pass on the sides and dive into the main platter. I mean who eats potatoes when you&#39;ve got CRABS!!<br><br>A few things to remember, first, don&#39;t expect five star service here. It&#39;s very casual and friendly, so relax and go with the flow. Secondly, bring the family. The prices are unbeatable and who better to share this place than with your own. Thirdly, loosen those belts or wear stretchy pants, because you&#39;re going to EAT, EAT, EAT!<br><br>The restaurant accepts credit cards, and you can order for take-out as well. <br><br>If you eat in, remember to leave the tip in cash. Your server will appreciate it!	1
Great meal, great service, and great atmosphere in the outdoor cafe, under the ivy. Everyone in my group enjoyed their meal. The specialty beers were excellent.	0
Average for brunch. Prix fixe is reasonable for NYC standards BUT there is nothing remarkable about the food. Decor and wait staff aside, it&#39;s not French by any stretch of the imagination. My food was bland and shapeless--and who serves French fries at brunch? Hash browns would be better. Not to mention my &#34;wild mushroom&#34; omelette was placed on top of the side salad, wilting all the lettuce and destroying its flavor. (Come to think of it, neither the mushrooms nor supposed cheese could be tasted.)<br><br>Your average diner will give you a tastier breakfast.	0
First, I didn&#39;t realize that the location was so far from our house. It was listed as a &#34;deal nearby&#34; even though it was over 25 minutes away. I am a huge fan of Kogi in California. I had the pleasure of eating Kogi at Coachella last year.<br><br>So, I was thrilled that a Korean-Mexican fusion restaurant was here in Vegas. So, after driving forever, we arrived. The first thing I was greeted with was &#34;we are closed and we didn&#39;t lock the doors. But if you order now, you can take it to go.&#34; Thanks to everyone&#39;s reviews I knew what to order.<br><br>The bulgogi quesadilla was very greasy. The fried kimchee had a layer of grease floating on it. The meat didn&#39;t have the marinated flavor everyone talked about. The bulgogi burrito had a lot of rice and beans, lots of filler. The highlight was the spam musubi. The spam was fried and crispy. <br><br>So my experience could be just bad because we got there at closing. I would have rather left than paid for ok food and received the impression I was inconveniencing the owners.	0
My boyfriend and I wanted to try someplace new and found this place on Urban Spoon it was close so we decided to go! The food is good but what blew us away was this amazing waitress! Literally the best customer service we have ever had! Even though the food was good (the fried rice is delicious an amazing) the service is what will bring us back.	1
Came here for drinks and appetizers on a Friday night. Order Hendricks martini and meatball appetizer. The martini was well made but they didn&#39;t have blue cheese olives. The meatballs were amazing. Flavorful. A great recommendation from yelp. The complimentary bread was great for dipping in the left over sauce. Can&#39;t wait to come back and try dinner!	1
I have visited Carmines several times and have not been disappointed.  The atmosphere, staff and meals remind me of Sunday dinner at Grandmas.  Food is fabulous and service is wonderful.  Love this place!	1
The best Seattle has to offer. Great Pizza, great service good value and it was all I could do to stop myself from ordering a second pizza for desert. The Crust is amazing, Sausage as good or better than the best Chicago has to offer. This is a top shelf place. We loved it.	0
Awesomeness! Food=great! Try them sweet-tater fries!	0
THE WORST SERVICE EVER!I had breakfast here about two weeks ago. It was a warm Sunday & my significant other was craving French toast. IHOP was packed. We came here thinking K2 would be it's usual, line outside the door. My breakfast partner ordered French toast with strawberries with two scrabbled eggs & bacon. The waitress walked away WITHOUT asking to place my order. Then when I waived her over to take my order her response was "Oh, that's all for you?!?!" To my significant other. Mind you my significant other is a grown man & that is a typical breakfast. I would order that & not finish my meal & I'm a fairly tiny girl. You think after that mistake, she would be on her toes, but no. It only went further downhill from there. Her attitude from the beginning was as if she hated her job & didn't want to be there.She never returned to ask how our meal was or to freshen our beverages! Again, this was two weeks ago. I'm still bothered by the awful experience, because I take my hard earned money for good food, ambiance & good service. I have told all my friends about this. I will NEVER give this place a second chance, not only because of bad service, but the food was mediocre.Alcove, Home & K2 will be my go to Sunday brunch places.	0
Had the breakfast sandwich with avocado and it was excellent!	1
Love sitting outside- THE BEST ICED TEA! The service is good, they dont bother you too much. I try something new almost every time I go. Granola with the strawberries and bananas is YUMMY!	1
Wonderful live jazz at dinner. As someone over 60 it was great to be in a room filled with young working professionals that were kicking back on a Friday after work but weren't the suit and heels crowd from the financial district. Fun drinks, good food, attentive wait staff that tried very hard to help with special food allergy needs. Pulled pork nachos were very good. Rest of the food was good, not over the top wonderful. The food ran a close second to the feel of the place. It was loud but not in an intrusive way. Could have stayed for hours. Very upbeat vibe. Nice evening out. Looking forward to trying the bluegrass brunch.	1
I'd heard about this place before and decided to try it out while my girlfriend and I were visiting Los Angeles. It was an early Friday afternoon and we were seated promptly on the patio, which I've heard is quite unusual. I went with the heuvos rancheros and the lady had eggs benedict. Very enjoyable brunch and a great spot to people watch. Service was also just as excellent.	1
This is my "go to" place! LA Cafe is around the corner from where I live and I literally go here about 3-4 times a week. I have never been disappointed with any of their food. I actually grabbed a few sandwiches from here a few weeks ago to use during a hike and picnic, and the sandwiches held up for an hour long hike. They have a great selection of food, drinks (non-alcoholic), and desserts/snacks to choose from. I only eat fish and seafood and there are plenty of options for me here.I also like that they are open 24 hours. After coming home from the club or late night outing I can always count on them to be open when no one else is.So definitely, if you are in DTLA and looking for something to eat, stop by LA Cafe! :D	1
This place was a great surprise! The food was excellent. The service was good. I can&#39;t wait to come back. The macaroni and cheese was the best we ever had.	1
I love Serious Pie!!	1
The potato pancakes here are amazing. I have never eaten anything at Canter's that was not delicious. Even their burgers are good. They are usually pretty fast to seat and serve as well.My only complaint is they are really pricey. I have been to Diner style restaurants my whole life and never paid as much as I do when I come here. Yes, the food is great, but the price is a bit much.	1
Hot? Yeah, well, it&#39;s Hunan food - isn&#39;t that part of the point? A buddy in Vegas suggested I stop by Dong Ting Spring after he overheard me complain that I hadn&#39;t had good Hunan food in years - and he was absolutely correct. I had the smoked ham with dried turnip as well as an order of eggplant with long beans. The smoked ham was as good as I&#39;ve ever had: high quality meat, plenty of it, with leeks and chilies like you wouldn&#39;t believe. The eggplant was super tasty as well with fresh, delicious long beans mixed in with another generous helping of chilies.<br><br>Best of all are the staff: friendly, patient, and keen to make sure you enjoy your meal while making you feel welcome. The restaurant is spotlessly clean with an wide variety of dishes on the menu - it&#39;s shame I don&#39;t live in Vegas because I&#39;ll never get to try everything they serve!<br><br>The only downside is the lack of a liquor license: iced water and hot tea are offered right up front, they do have some sodas, but alas no beer.	1
I hadnt been here in a few years, its still just as good as it used to be. Cant go wrong. Brought my date here after we caught a show, now she's a fan too... And its open 24 hrs... Yay!!	1
Soggy crab rolls and a generally tasteless meal. I also got the Bahn XEO and tomato garlic rice. Bill was $30 and change, extremely pricey for below mediocore food. First time having Vietnamese food but this was a poor introduction that I won&#39;t let deter a 2nd try but somewhere else of course.	0
This place is by far one of my favorite rooftop lounges in DTLA! The view is spectacular and the vibe is just chill and classy all around. If you get there before 9 pm, the line isn't as long but don't let a few people standing around single file scare you away. The line moves relatively quickly and the bouncer can have quite a sense of humor at times! Reservations are key if you want a table and plan to order food otherwise you may end up waiting an hour or more (usually more) before you're seated (which is totally doable). In the mean time, go upstair or outdoors and grab a drink and toast to a fantastic night out in this wonderful town! There's usually a DJ spinning great music inside and on occasion, you can catch a live number from a band as you gaze at the skyscrapers amidst the night sky. If you're looking to grab a drink, there's a bar outdoors too but be advised that they have a more limited drink menu relative to the one indoors. The My Fair Lady is a great signature drink to try. If you decide to grab something to eat, just know that the late night menu is slightly different than the dinner one. I've tried food from both menus (some of the items overlap) and I can say that everything that I've tried so far, has been good...the poutine is a must! Bon appetite & cheers!	1
I have eaten at Bottega Louie a few times. The food is good and the service is good as well. HOWEVER the management is terrible. Do not ever try to plan a party or catering. I had a group of 20 I wanted to arrange a dinner for and after 3 emails and a phone call over 3 weeks I still NEVER got an answer back. The email was read by several people including Kevin Mckellar, Daniel Flores, Nicole Tilley and a Jschneider but not one person ever got back to me. I run a company that does a lot of event planning. This is the worst management I have ever experienced. Apparently they do not need my business or the business of my clientele. I will go to Cicada or Roys or any one of the other fabulous restaurants downtown. I definitely will never recommend Bottega Louie for anything more than a coffee and pastry. What a disappointment in management. I will make sure I pass on my experience to my friends and clients. Thanks for nothing Bottega Louie. Looking at the other revues this is not a isolated incident and Bottega Louie while they advertise they can do a large group for dinner will not.	0
Very good food. I had black beans with yellow-red rice, plantains, and Chivo (goat meat) with onions and avocado. All for eight dollars. Lunch special with a variety of meat options for $6.50 plus tax. The avocado is extra. I ate at the place which is small and has limited seating. Service is good. People are nice. I would go again. I like good food at inexpensive prices. Not fancy at all but service is good and food is even better. It&#39;s all about the food in my book.	1
Amazing food and service. I absolutely love the carne asada fries!! I take all my girlfriends here all the time.	1
This is my first review with yelp, and i felt it was much needed after the horrible experience at this restaurant.<br><br> I should have known better than to stay and dine in a restaurant where the owner (Juana herself) greets you and asks right away &#34;are you visiting or eating?&#34; This given that with the exception of a family of 6 , this rather large restaurant was completely empty on a Sunday at 8!<br><br>The place is nicely decorated and has a romantic feel to it, but it&#39;s not quite the same when the place is empty. The owner was nice and attempted to be our waitress. She quickly lost points with us when she first served a bottle of wine to a couple that arrived after my girlfriend and i, and even though we had already ordered our drinks before the other couple&#39;s arrival. <br><br>We ordered appetizers, which were ok. Calamari was salty and greasy, and the owner came by, not to ask, but rather imply how good the calamari was ?!? I ordered a beef empanada, and that i must say was really good. For entrees, my girlfriend ordered the spaghetti carbonera, which was very flavorful. It was far better than at a lot of Italian places I&#39;ve previously ordered it at. I ordered the skirt steak, and it was probably one of the worst pieces of meat I&#39;ve ever eaten. This $30 steak was loaded with fat, and far too thin. Add to that a side of bland mash potatoes for an additional $6, and i had a highly disappointing $36 meal. Juana came by once to ask our opinion, and i told her the steak had way too much fat on it. She took blame for it stating that she told her chef too leave extra fat on it for flavor. Whatever... About 20 mins passed in between her asking our opinion on the food and the next visit from a bus boy. I requested the check, that took an additional 15 mins or so to be brought out. I didn&#39;t even bother to get dessert, and left highly disappointed and hungry!! Juana did sit and the bar with a few friends enjoying her wine and thanking us as we walked out.. <br><br>Needless to say, this spot will never get another penny from me. It&#39;s a shame given that the place has potential, but the quality of food is very poor, especially for what they charge for entrees. There are far too many good restaurants in Brickell to wanna visit this place ever again.	0
The burger was okay..... the french fries was just as good quality as Costco French Fries or some grocery stores frozen french fries. <br><br>Quite Honestly, I think In-N-Out burger is better!!! THe service is very awkward too, the server/owner/whoever he is doesn&#39;t really talk to you at all. He takes orders with no acknowledgement or response after you place your order and just serves you. <br><br>Also, if you decide to come here, make sure to bring cash. It&#39;s Cash only.	0
Yum. Great Indian food on Monroe st.	0
Toast is absolutely INCREDIBLE. The bread they start you off with is soft and tasty and is served with an amazing green dipping sauce. Also, the main entrees are quite inexpensive for the enormous proportions they give you. I had a turkey club sandwich. It was delicious and more than filling. I went there for dinner one night and only waited about 5 minutes. The setting is also very cool. No booth style seating here. If you choose you can sit in the laid back couch area. This place is truly a MUST for anyone living in or visiting LA.	1
It's been a loonnngg time since I've been here! Came here for lunch & had it to-go as well. Toast Bakery Cafe is a great little lunch spot but it's always packed! You can either park farther on the street or across at the structure for $6. If you like tomato basil soup, it's awesomely tasty here! Highly recommended. The nicoise salad was light made me feel all kinds of healthy with the corn, green beans, etc. This time, I also tried every kind of cupcake they had, well except for coconut 'cause I don't like coconut. My favorite is the red velvet, carrot cake & chocolate. *Red Velvet: I know the word moist shouldn't be used but the cupcake itself was! The frosting had a really nice home made quality to it & it was slightly more tangy than sweet*Carrot Cake: This was just delicious all around. Recommend!*Chocolate: Like the stuffed strawberry, the chocolate is velvety rich. A LOT of their frosting is cream cheese-based like on the ones for the marble. It works for some but not so much for others. They had also green velvet as opposed to blue. Interesting because the inside of the cupcake was SO green. The artificialness looked kind of scary. Their menu is so extensive that it's difficult to make a choice. I've skipped out on breakfast twice now, so I'll be back to try it out!	1
I'd give this place 2.5 stars if possible. Tables excruciatingly close together, noise level tolerable, but because tables are so close it's hard not being distracted by other conversations, portions are teeny weeny and super pricey for pasta. Additionally, our orders came in all kinds of crazy sporadic order. And for goodness sake, in a place called flour+ water, you have to ask for bread. Come on...don't get the hype--been there, done with f+w.	0
Pan sauteed snapper was like a cross between a heavily frizzled fried egg and a shoe insole. It was seasoned ok, but way too tough and dry. Sides were unispired.	0
I&#39;ve been a SuViche fan since they opened their closet-sized fast service spot in Brickell. Happily, they have evolved into a strong full-service restaurant with three locations, of which this is their newest.<br><br>The ambiance is really lovely, with a high-ceiling patio complete with graffiti from local artists and giant comfy swings. The vegetation in front is medium-high, so the traffic is not bothersome.<br><br>Always a consistent restaurant, SuViche&#39;s food once again is on point. We had the special &#34;Eye Doctor&#34; sushi, which had tempura shrimp, eel sauce, spicy mayo, avocado, and perhaps a few more yummy ingredients. It balanced extremely well and was quite a hit.<br><br>I had the special rocoto ceviche, which was deliciously spicy and acidic. Ample fish were topped with crispy onions. Just how it&#39;s supposed to be! <br><br>Hubby and friend each got a ceviche they were equally happy with, and my bestie had the tuna huancaina (I think I have the name right there). Her tuna dish was out of control! Perfectly cooked, sushi sized pieces of cold yellow potato were topped with raw tuna, piled high. <br><br>While the food was all kinds of delicious, I&#39;m sad to report that the pisco sours were disappointing. There was no egg white used, so the drink fell flat. It was pisco + sour mix, which does not a proper pisco sour make. As a restaurant billing itself as having a pisco bar, I certainly expected a stellar drink. It&#39;s possible there was some hiccup that caused this travesty, so I&#39;m willing to give the pisco bar another shot. I&#39;ll be sure to ask some questions before I order next time though.<br><br>Our service was definitely above average and friendly (thank you, Jessica!)<br><br>Also note there is a free private lot right behind the restaurant. Score!<br><br>Bottom Line: Stellar addition to the Wynwood/Midtown neighborhood offering well-priced fresh sushi and ceviche and great service in a quaint atmosphere.<br><br>PS - a little birdie told me they are going to start Delivery soon.	1
Food: Ordered the Spicy Totto Ramen and the Mega Ramen. I did not like the noodles. It was too soft. Out of the two, I would go with the Mega Ramen. Mega Ramen is basically a pork lover&#39;s choice. However, the pork (not pork belly) was too dried. As a meat lover, I didn&#39;t even eat all the pork. The broth was standard and nothing special. It wasn&#39;t bad though. The Spicy Totto Ramen was a tad spicy but nothing that burns your mouth. Basically, spicy to them means crazy whole boat loads of black pepper. Didn&#39;t really care for the broth.<br><br>Ambiance: Not that noisy. They have regular tables and tall tables. <br><br>Service: Ate pretty fast here since I had 30 min left on parking meter. Nothing bad or good to note.<br><br>The Bottom Line: Won&#39;t be back. I prefer to go next door to Hide-Chan.	0
The only thing worthy of this place is the ambiance being that it&#39;s great during cool weather. Bathrooms are disgusting to the point where a couple would be considered out of order from the wretched stench and the service was probably just as bad with their attitude and how unprofessional they were starting from the outside bartender(s) to the security. What type of human being who works with the public throws a persons credit card and security throws objects to the customers. Very low class people pretending to be in a high class environment. First and last time going to this place until they re-evaluate their staff on their behavior. I nor the party of 15 people I had that night have had such bad experience anywhere and I will make sure people are aware along with the promoters I know and any other entrepreneur(s) who want to visit this location. You&#39;re staff will degrade the business until a for sale sign is posted!<br><br>Let&#39;s not forget if you complain, rather than correcting the problem(s) in hand you get back an idiotic comment from someone extremely immature because that&#39;s how business is done in their handbook.	0
Wonderful spanish food and great service. Its a mom and pop restaurant except this one is a mom and daughter buss. Homemade and fresh..... I had the lenguado (fish ) grilled with asparagus and steamed potatoes! Excellent! Do not hesitate , its a must.	1
From start to finish, Capital Grille was excellent. Reasonably priced choices for bottles of wine. Superb food. They paid attention to the fact that we were celebrating a birthday ( without having to be reminded) and brought out a lovely congratulatory dessert to the table. A wonderful dining experience.	1
Went there on Saturday for lunch. We sat in the new area to the left. The place was empty but we were sat at this mini two-top in this awkward corner...	0
Yum! Pizza is always good but the Caesar salad is absolutely AMAZING!!!! Great dressing fresh greens and perfect croutons. So so so good!	1
Just ok.  We had the fried chicken, prime rib sandwich n sweet potato raviolis. All were fine...nothing special.	1
I dined at Golden Temple about 10 years ago when I lived in Brookline.  Haven't been back since until last week and now I remembered why I didn't go back.  The service was extremely slow.  Had to wait 30 minutes for a wait staff to come over to take our drink order.  Every wait staffs that walked by our table just ignored us.  My husband finally had to walk over to get someone to the table.  And this was exactly what happened 10 years ago!  Food was just OK.  There are a lot more Chinese restaurants in the neighborhood with better food and much better service.  I will remember never to go back!	0
I tried the Umami burger. It was soggy and it tasted...I don't know...weird. It's hard to describe. I feel like they decided to throw in every possible flavor without balancing them. The smell of the fried cheese on top was enough to make me gag a little bit. I had to force myself to choke down maybe two thirds of the burger so I wouldn't have to put my $11 to waste. Just go to In-N-Out.	0
The owner said he wanted this to be a place for the community but he opened the single most expensive cafe in the neighborhood thus ensuring that others will follow.<br><br> I understand the desire to make lots of money as quickly as possible but the prices are ridiculous. The coffee is around $3 for a really small cup (4 oz?) and no refills. We&#39;ve come to expect coffee to be a minimum standard size. Also, most of the beers are over $10 for 10 or 12 oz. If he was so intent on making this a &#39;place for the community&#39;, why not have a couple of more reasonable options. <br><br>Don&#39;t even get me started on the fact that they don&#39;t have low fat or non-fat milk. The owner thinks that whole milk is healthier which one can debate, but seriously, one can argue that their gooey pastries made of refined white flour and sugar and not that healthy either. Sometimes in trying too hard to be so hip and cutting edge comes across as being somewhat dictatorial. It&#39;s a cafe for eff&#39;s sake, give people options and let them decide.	0
I have been a regular at Puerto Viejo since it first opened, however, it is getting ONE STAR for the horrendous service I received on Saturday evening. <br><br>I decided to have a group dinner with some girlfriends who aren&#39;t from Brooklyn. Upon arrival, I was greeted by the hostess and seated almost immediately. AT first it was 5 of us, then our 6th friend joined us 10 minutes later. When she first came in, the waiter was haphazardly blocking the aisle and impeding anyone from coming into the restaurant. My friend politely said excuse me, and the waiter (I don&#39;t know his name because our receipt said Leandro but the manager and hostess refused to give me his name) told my friend that she needed to wait until he finished conversing with a customer. After that, every time he passed our table he rolled his eyes at my friend. When it was time to take our orders, he handed out 5 waters (did not hand one to her) and did not even address her. Because of this waiter&#39;s OBNOXIOUS behavior, she refused to order anything. But when the bill came, I noticed gratuity was included. I asked the waiter at what number is gratuity included, he told me that gratuity is added when there are 6 or more guests. When i asked him why was gratuity included when he hasn&#39;t even acknowledged my friend, he told me &#34;i seated 6 guests.&#34; When we asked to speak the the manager, not only would he not get him for us but he said we can walk to the bar and ask for the manager ourselves. When we did that, he called over a woman and told us that she was the manager. After a BRIEF convo with her, she admitted that she was just a DISH WASHER and not in fact the manager. After all of that, we finally found the manager and had the gratuity removed (after a short argument). I WILL NEVER COME BACK TO THIS RESTAURANT AGAIN. I have frequented many restaurants in NY and have never experienced such rudeness and dishonesty in my life. Save yourself the agita and dine elsewhere.	0
This place is pretty good. This place shares the lot with Cafe Concerto. Parking is Valet for $2 and do not mistake the entrance for something behind it! You enter through the ramp.Ordered the bul dalk (spicy chicken) level 4. I wanted level 6 but the waitress discouraged me from getting it (I was a little annoyed by this, but she meant well (: ). So, level 4 was just okay spicy for me. I can definitely handle more. The order doesn't come with rice, so if you want rice then you should order it separately. However, you don't need rice to eat it. There is some crispy rice things under the chicken and it's sufficient.I will come back to try spicier levels! This place is pretty darn good	1
Favorite items on the menu are...1. Spicy Cigars2. Lamb Swarma3. Hummus4. Lamb Kefta5. Sliders6. New for me forget what it's called (Gaffet? - Hot Canoli type thing...)	1
so i have to say, my recent visit to this place was awesome! the fatty tuna (toro) was like buttery and delicious... and i gotta say, the spicy tuna is pretty yummy! i didn&#39;t think the lettuce would be good in this cut roll.. it made it taste refreshing! i would definitely go back.. nom nom nom!	1
I&#39;ve only been coming here for dinner. The burgers are delicious and comes with a good portion of fries or salad. The waitstaff are accommodating, friendly, and patient. On my first visit, my friend and I were given green shots of an eclectic mixture of liqueurs from the mixologist who was getting experimental. I thought that was a nice welcome.<br><br>There&#39;s always a good amount of people in there to be busy, but not crowded. It&#39;s really nice to have another sit down restaurant that has a good variety of menu items that is now close by. <br><br>My most recent dinner here was light. I chose a market salad and the Moroccan soup from the starters section. I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m reviewing a salad, but for 5$, it came filled in a large bowl with a light &amp; flavorful vinaigrette. I took my partially eaten soup to go.	1
Nice atmosphere and our wine was crisp and light. I had the tenderloin and although I ordered medium it was very rare and I could barely eat it. My husband had a rib eye and it was tough and fatty. Service was average but next time we opt for a steak will be going elsewhere.	0
This place is only opened a few weeks, They have a great selection of fresh juices especially the vampire juice. My food favorite so far are the beef empanadas, guacamole and steak with mushroom taco. My friend had a tostada and some kind of spicy pork and loved it. Finally there is a decent place to get food in this neighborhood.	1
Long lines for just so-so food. Perhaps the high ratings are due to the nostalgia factor coupled with very few breakfast options on the Hill.	0
I ate here for the first time today. I work in the area and was tired of trying the same places. The place was busy, but the service was great, friendly and timely. The food came out in a timely manner and everyone enjoyed!	1
I'd been driving by their cheery orange umbrella-patio on Olympic for a while, now. I like the faux-retro decor. I'm not an Arby's fan, so I won't compare, but this is a delicious, substantial roast beef sandwich. Very tender, almost suspiciously so, but delicious. I got the "Black & Bleu," with fries, and even though I was ravenous, it was a fight to finish all of it. I did anyway, and I hate myself now. No, seriously--curly fries tasty, but eminently shareable; I can't imagine how filling the "dirty" fires or ones with toppings are. With normal hunger the sandwich alone would be plenty. Will have to return for the frozen custard--absolutely no way it would've gone down after the sandwich & fries. Counter staff cheerful and efficient. That is one noisy patio with grimy La Brea whizzing by, but it was friendly and spotless. Pricing excellent for the size and quality. Bonus: they have one of those wacky soda machines that will add flavors in any bizarre combo. Lime-Vanilla-Cherry Ginger Ale? Yes, please!!	1
Probably the best kept secret in Madison. If you think you like Mexican you haven't seen anything yet. Go here and you'll never eat faux Mexican (i.e. Taco Bell, Chipotle, etc.) ever again. You can get a seat at the bar and watch them cook the food right in front of you with Telemundo playing in the background. This place is authentic Mexican food and the people are very nice. I am a fan of the sopes and their cow tongue is pretty tasty too.	0
Someone at this establishment tried to use my credit card information fraudulently. <br><br>Luckily Chase caught it quickly and suspended the card.<br><br>Normally I wouldn&#39;t post this because I have a hard time blaming the establishment for isolated actions of a rogue employee but this case was egregious. <br><br>I called to inform the owner that he might have a shady employee and I was hung up on. <br><br>So I called back and asked for the greeter&#39;s and owner&#39;s names and was ignored and told nobody was available. <br><br>I left my phone number and was called back almost immediately by a second person who denied anything I mentioned, sometimes before I wad halfway through a sentence. <br><br>So unfortunately for the owners I&#39;m advising you to stay far, far away from this place.	0
I didn&#39;t know places like this existed in Los Angeles. I love the lemon tea, its perfect! The ambience is awesome; grass, picnic tables, little cubbies in the shrubs. I love coming here to destress. It&#39;s its own little oasis in the midst of downtown. Blocking out all the traffic and riffraff. This place is definitely a Gem!	1
I was underwhelmed by my birthday dinner at CUT. The hostess was wonderful, the wine list was great but our server was an automaton who seemed slightly annoyed that I wasn't ready to order when he wanted me to order. That set the tone. My disappointment comes not totally from the service but from the food. I had the Wagyu ribeye and it was almost inedible. The waiter explained that the meat would be prepared with a char-crust -- which I like a lot however, my crust would be best described as a salt crust. I tried my best but it was no good and in truth, I wasn't at all confident that if I sent it back there would be any difference. I also got the mushrooms and peppers -- big mistake as the green peppers completely overwhelmed the mushrooms. In fairness, my friend had the crab/shrimp Louis starter and LOVED it! She also had a filet which was perfectly cooked. I had the butter lettuce salad and it was good as well. I expected so much more. I am in Vegas often and was looking forward to this experience.	1
Great little place for breakfast. I ordered the stuffed french toast and was very happy. I&#39;m sort of partial to french toast at the mission in san diego but french toast here was great.	1
Hey this place isn&#39;t 3 1/2 stars! I think its pretty good and I get the 17.99 one. They have a lot of extras I like such as Do Shi Rak (kimchi fried rice w egg) that comes with the combo. Meats not too bad either obviously it ain&#39;t Kobe.. but its good. Try it out.	1
The sausages are some of the best I&#39;ve had, forget Wurstkuche... unlike them these guys make them in house. The sides are killer, very fresh. Amazing beer list. They were also playing a bunch of great 90s indie rock when I was there, so they get even extra points. One of my favorite new additions to the neighborhood.	1
A Little Taste help me quit my Starbucks routine. Great coffee and SO SO SO good, creative pastries.	1
Visiting Miami and stopped at Casa Juan the food was delicious and everyone&#39;s review about big portions is correct. Service was great too. I recommend to stop in and try thir surf and turf if u can&#39;t decide what to eat.	1
OMG. I didn&#39;t know that fish tacos could taste that good. I felt like I was living out the fish taco scene in &#34;I Love You, Man.&#34; These tacos were light, crunchy, and fun - a perfect symphony of flavors and textures.	1
Went here on a Wednesday. The happy hour includes $5 on most burgers! The burgers were a good size and tasty.<br><br>When walking on 1st look for a red colored gate and you&#39;ll go down an alley to get to the bar. You&#39;ll see table and lights strung up between the 2 buildings. There was a chalkboard sign that lead us to the way but be warned blink and you&#39;ll miss it. <br><br>They also have live music starting around 7pm except Mondays.<br><br>If you are in Little Tokyo and need a watering hole, check this place out!	1
Last winter, my husband and I went to Saigon Noodles to satisfy a pho craving and I would describe it as a good meal.... but being freezing cold, despite sitting at a table very far from the door. Today, my husband and I had another craving and we were in the area so we ventured over to Saigon Noodles. I would not come back to this restaurant-the chicken skewers we ordered, which were around $6 were made of greasy chicken product (think nuggets) and came without any sauce and stale veggies on the side. Our pho ga lacked any flavor and arrived cold....I also found a hair in my pho. The worse part of the meal was being literally frozen. I will admit that today was a particularly cold day, but the restaurant was filled with folks with their coats on. Unfortunately, this restaurant is completely understaffed as well...the poor waitresses were running around like crazy and didn't come to the table except to take our order.	1
Ridiculous! We sat down for 25 minutes before the waitress took our Orders!<br>They had 3 people waiting the room, what kind of arrangement in table service u called this!!! <br><br>Wont come back for<br>Sure!	0
This is really good Chinese food in the Brookline area. There are not many quality Chinese restaurants but this is very good.	1
Consistently cooks a great steak wherever the location, Capital Grill In LV didn't disappoint with the steaks my friend and I were served the other night.   The only problem was the server.  While she was very nice, it has seemed liked she was not trained very well. Didn't know any details about basic bar drinks nor several of the menu items and had to run back to the bar or kitchen several times for information.  And e en then, didn't get the info I asked for.   I can tell you that the servers in the philly Capital Grill know everything about all of the menu items and are well versed in all things bar.  I attribute the problem to poor training by management who needs to pay more attention to their training methods.   Why the big deal?  Because this makes a Huge difference in the dining experience when you have top notch servers.	1
This is a wonderful addition to the community. There&#39;s always something going on here whether its live music or clothing drives. The cafe is eclectic with a great artist vibe. The spinach salad is a must!!! Looking forward to future events. I&#39;ll be back for sure. I love that they offer board games and books, I spent 6 hours here!	1
Everyone&#39;s right, their abalone porridge is really good. Of course, I&#39;ve been there twice and that&#39;s the only thing I&#39;ve tried. I&#39;m planning on giving their ginseng chicken soup a shot next time. But mind you, the abalone porridge isn&#39;t the most flavorful thing in the world, but it&#39;s damn comforting. Especially since, coming from an Asian family, I am away from home all summer, sometimes I just crave a big bowl of my mom&#39;s hot soothing porridge. This porridge hits the spot, and their complimentary side dishes go perfectly with it. Mmmm...	1
How have I not been here before?! The entrance to the restaurant is unique and a little hard to find if it's your first time there. We went for Sunday football and was hesitant that it would be packed, but surprisingly there was plenty of room and multiple T.V. screens that were playing different games. I ordered the Far Bar burger and it was more then what I expected! Their wasabi fries are to die for but I'm sure everyone here has been raving about them so you already know! I will definitely be coming back but next time it will have to be during dinner time because of the lights outside on the patio. Service is excellent as well!	1
Restaurant setting for dinner matches connected eclectic kimpton hotel. Nice tapas selection and good service. Recommend.	1
Bloody Marys? Spicy and delicious. Brunch (Blunch) ? Killed it. The crab cake breakfast was so good that I'm not sure any breakfast will ever make me this happy again. The wait is long but totally worth it..	1
Canter's is my go to for a corned beef & pastrami sandwhich. Although, it doesn't always come out hot. Their bakery is great though! Rainbow cookies for life!	1
Very good restaurant . Great American breakfast wow and good quality. Service niv e abd great decor. Wanna country breakfast ir Lu Ch or dinner look no more hummm	1
After more than one visit to Umami burger I'm prepared to give up that 4th star. Since then I've been in smaller groups and that has dramatically improved the experience and the customer service.I've now tired not just the Port and Stilton but also the SoCal Burger, Truffle Burger, Manly Burger and Carnitas Burger. I've literally never had a bad bite of burger here. The carnitas burger was different and good but I definitely prefer the regular burgers. The truffle burger in particular is awesome (as well as the Manly Burger). I'm very much interested in trying the Earth Burger and the Greenbird. During my last meal here I also enjoyed some onion rings that basically made me super happy. I even dipped them in the weird Umami ketchup that is sort of growing on me. When it's all said and done, Umami is a good eats. The burgers are across the board awesome. After my moderate first experience I was hesitant to return but am so glad that I did. It's definitely a yummy time.	1
I thought this was going to be a great experience but I was wrong, the food was horrible and service was terrible. I brought a plus one and it was going well till the food came out. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this place. Trust me	0
I've tried almost every pastry in this shop and I've loved them all. As a bonus the woman who works the counter is the sweetest person I've dealt with in the food service industry. Honest! Go see for yourself!	1
I have been coming to this Noodles and Company for YEARS and have been of many others.. This is still the best quality Noodles, hands down. All clean, and the food always tastes like it was just made, not pre cooked like a lot of other Noodles I've been to.	0
I love seafood! And KOREAN STYLE BBQ seafood?!? Even better!?! Their portions are large and you definitely get bang for your buck. I've only sat outdoors in the balcony and PREFER to sit there because the smell goes right up and outdoors where you could hear the cars on the street. It makes you feel like you're in Korea at one of those "po-jang-ma-cha's.(tented street food bar) They even give out all these side dishes and pretty filling "appetizers" (an-joos) before the main dish comes out. SO, either soju or beer is a plus!All their seafood comes out FRESH, as if they just came out of the ocean. I couldn't ask for fresher head on shrimp, abalone, jumbo scallops, mussels, large clams, baby octopus, oysters and more clams! Mmmm... just thinking about the hot charcoal firing up and cooking the seafood, with bubbly juices coming out as they cook from the sooty charcoal aroma!The only bad thing is that there are ALWAYS a lot of people, so patience is a plus or go early, before the dinner crowd.* IN FAVOR OF: ABSOLUTELY all fresh ingredients, free appetizer (and portion!), fast service.* AGAINST: The long wait if you go during peak dinner hours.	1
I have been here numerous times and I have never ben let down. I am sad to see that Gregg and Keila left bad reviews for them. I have eaten French food all over the world and I dont think they deserve it unless the service was terrible. I ordered the steak frites and cheese and we all got carried away. The menu is good and the wine menu is quite extensive. I rarely go downtown to eat and this was a treat.	1
Thai Tom lost my business forever tonight. I'm battle hardened to their always terrible service but sitting at a table for an hour and a half without explanation and then receiving sub par food was too much to endure ever ever ever again. This will be irrelevant to them I am aware but I feel compelled to make a note to myself for future reference. Not worth it!	0
Mmmm... Lola's.	1
Second night here in a row. Food great. Staff service good. Why is it spoilt by bus boy staff leaving you dirty cutlery after a course. This is the difference between outstanding service and not.	1
Well I&#39;ve been back a few times and I can now say I have figured out exactly what to order here. The guacamole and chips are the best I&#39;ve had anywhere and I am a chips and guacamole aficionado. Tonight I had the carne asada and I don&#39;t even like skirt steak so let me start by telling you that. It was so incredibly tender and flavorful I can&#39;t give it enough stars. I also dined here the other week and I had the scallops and they were delicious. I had the tamales and I thought they were just so so. The only problem with this place is it is noisy and there is no seat in the house you can find that isn&#39;t noisy. I guess the best thing is to just go early. I&#39;m hoping that they eventually get some outside seating where you can at least in the summertime get away from all the noise. My server tonight was Judy and she was absolutely fantastic and attentive. she was the one who suggested the carne asada and she was right on the money.	1
Just had ramen there for dinner. I had the tonkotso ramen (added an egg). If I had to use one word to sum it up it would be salty. They must have used a ton of salt or MSG to the point that I couldn't really taste any pork in the broth (maybe there was no pork). The egg was THE worst. It tasted like it was marinated in regular soy sauce. Yes. The marinade is supposed to contain soy sauce but not JUST soy sauce. If there were such a thing as solid soy sauce that must be what it would taste like.	0
Great place, divey and with a great selection of cocktails very creative but one thing i have to bring up was the food. Totally unexpected, starting with some very creative guacamoles and ceviches. From the hot kitchen you have to try the croquetas, melty and crispy, the arepas are great also. For the main course, you have to have to have to try the short ribs, good service over all and affordable!	1
We've been back at least 3 times and we always leave so happy. The food is delicious, the portions generous, the wine list offers variety and service is friendly and competent. We thoroughly enjoyed the arugula and Cesar salads, the mussels were perfect, and the pappardelle with truffle burro was amazing, the Zuppa di pesce also a perfect combination if seafood in a tasty, delicately spiced broth. A great meal!	1
it a hole in the wall! but thats were the best foods come from! the meats are fresh! and all meats our cooked onsite while your wait for your enormous sub!! my fav is the chicken terriyaki sub with all the trimmings.	1
The decor and ambiance are very nice but the service here is HORRIBLE. And the food is not that good. I tried to give this cafe one more chance after my first attempt where I was waited on by a man who was clearly an aspiring actor and this was his part-time job and he looked miserable. You could tell he hated waiting on me. Every time I asked for more water, he looked at me like "really?". So last night I went again to give it another chance and the waiter was even more annoyed with the fact that he was a waiter and it got so bad that I wrote him a note on my receipt telling him how unwelcome he made me feel from the moment I walked in the door.	0
I know this is going to sound like a heap of self-loathing on my part, but the main reason for my distaste for Genki Ramen is that the food tastes Korean. The ramen didn't have that milky, fatty, umami-laden goodness you'd expect from the real deal (even at the crummiest of the Japanese-run restos you're bound to get a smidge of it) and the croquettes and katsu were undercrisped and a bit greasy. Operational touches indicated Korean nuances, like the filet used for the katsu that was on the thinner side (as Koreans used to serve it before they caught on to using chop-size cuts like the Js), which I actually prefer, but it just indicates to me that I'm having more of a fusion-y, interpretive experience. What saves this place for me is that they have decent happy hour offerings, and beers are actually quite affordable.If I happen to be mistaken and there is, in fact, no Korean involved in the operation of this restaurant, then it is truly my mistake and for that I am sorry. But then again, if this is the case, this is a bunch of Japanese people who just don't know how to make good Japanese food. You tell me which is worse. It doesn't really make a difference for me, since I have bags of Shin Ramen-- what Korea really does well.	0
Simply put: the best burger I have ever had!I recently moved back to Texas, and I am having major withdrawals (Texas is the land of the burger, but I have found nothing that compares to Umami Burger)! If anyone is listening, please consider opening a restaurant in Houston.	1
1.5 stars overall. I&#39;ve been very disappointed with my last two visits here. Still unbelievably crowded but, that is a side issue to what is driving my disappointment. The quality of the burger/cooking temperatures has had serious quality control issues. One time the burger was dangerously rare. I showed a worker passing by (you can&#39;t really get up from your seat to complain because your chair/space may be gone upon your return-yes, it is that busy). She sent a manager over, whom was very apologetic. She put in a new order to replace the burger, however, she got so busy, forgot to pick it up. It came after some prompting by me, 20 minutes later. She was, again, very apologetic but, I wasn&#39;t really hungry anymore.<br><br>Last week, I gave SS another shot (I like fresh, non hormone treated burgers). I think it is my last visit at this location (but, may give the soon to be opened Vegas location a try). This time my burger was so overdone, it was crispy (thus super dry). So, disappointing! Even the shake was tasteless-and I&#39;ve never had an issue with the ice cream quality previously.<br><br>Fries still tasty. Thus, the 1.5 stars.	0
Our go to spot for sushi. They have fresh fish, good service, and awesome sushi shefs.The wait gets very long most of the time. Make sure you get a number ticket when you walk in. The bar seating is usually faster so we sit there. Perfect for a party of 2-4. When its less hectic we get table seating.We usually have our own set menu but we try new things almost once every time we go. Consists of: toro sushi, salmon belly sushi, blue fin tuna sushi, albacore sushi w ponzu/chives, and a sashimi dinner. Maybe include one hand roll (love the spicy scallop hand roll)Love the salmon and can eat it all dayyyyy	1
While the farm to table trend is one that my palate truly appreciates and admires , this savvy restaurant is one that I would have to rate mediocre at best .	0
Okay fine. <br>This place rubs me the wrong way - the service was way too impatient. <br>I tried to like you, I tried to try you, but you turned me away because &#34;it wasn&#39;t convenient for you&#34; if I ordered some food before my friend could join me. <br>Is that what this is all about? If I am CONVENIENT for you? <br><br>So somewhere in the time I spent waiting in the cold, hungry and desolate, looking inside at your empty tables, and seeing the rather dryish omelettes being laid out, I lost my appetite. I called my friend and we picked another spot. <br><br>Someday, when it&#39;s &#34;convenient&#34; for me maybe I will try you out. <br>Otherwise, you&#39;re just not worth the wait.	0
Fantastic cocktails, excellent food and very warm and friendly service. Will go again and again. <br>Did I mention the cocktails ?	1
This is definitely a place I will visit again. I had the lunch combo with the Hakata Ramen and salmon rice bowl and my ramen was Dynamite! I especially like how the marinated eggs were soft boiled, which mixed in well with the ramen and the meat was super savory.<br><br> We also had the takoyaki and chicken and gyoza appetizers. The only thing I did not enjoy much was the gyozas. They were a bit small and a little bland compared to some other places I&#39;ve been to.	1
The kitchen makes good food. But the wait-staff has a lot of trouble delivering it. That may be because there doesn't seem to be anyone in charge. Mixed up and missed orders seemed to be the flavor of the moderately busy day I was there. In watching the staff perform, a few things seemed to be wrong, IMO. One is that the barrista should not be bussing tables or anything else. That person should be responsible for putting drinks together with the meals and doing a final check on the order by looking at the oder ticket. This person should also be keeping an eye on where the various table IDs are, so he/she can direct the waiter efficiently. I would go to trays instead of handling plates (fewer trips, fewer mixups). The dishwashers should bus the tables by doing a regular sweep of the ding area; a little cart would be handy. There should be an outdoor wait person and an indoor person. There should be one swing staff who can jump from station to station as needed. People don't want to wait 30 min for a sandwich. If word gets around that you shouldn't eat here, then Precita Park will become an ice-cream and coffee place, and the disorganized waitstaff won't have jobs. So, waiters, get organized or get your resumes ready.	0
Came here for the second time on Tues night before 4th of July and it was a horrible experience! Because of this, I am dropping 4 starts to 2 stars. We were seated at the bar and we still had to wait at a minimum of 30 minutes to get our drinks each time. The bartenders were randomly choosing people; there was no particular order. Also, there is a line to go to the rooftop! I waited for 20 minutes, people were leaving but they weren't letting anyone in! Too much hype for Perch. Please go earlier in the night and choose a weekday if you want to check the place out!	0
Hands down, best clam chowder I've ever had.. They have the New England & Manhattan clam, salmon, corn, and specialty chowders... But they are known for their awesome clam chowder.. This is a great spot to come when its cold and rainy. It can get pretty crowded, you order inside and there are a couple spots to sit or you can sit outside and enjoy your soup. If you like bread, you can get your soup in a bread bowl or just order the sizes of cups you want. You will get a slice of bread and you can grab some oyster crackers.	0
I&#39;ve heard from many people about how amazing the galbi-jjim is here. I came with high expectations.<br><br>We ordered the galbi-jjim and haemul pajun. While the taste was decent, halfway thru the meal I noticed a giant cockroach (full thumb size) crawling up the wall next to my friend. We notified the owner/waitress who proceeded to yell at the helpers in the back to do something. When nobody budged, I took it upon myself to kill the cockroach. No longer hungry, we asked for the check.<br><br>We received a &#34;discount.&#34; All they discounted was the two sodas from our order. Pretty sad discount, pretty sad service.<br><br>Will NOT be coming back and will be telling everybody I encounter to stay the hell away from this place.	0
I had a turkey sandwich with Lentil soup and water from this place. I usually go to the Cheese course since I work on the building but I decided to give them a try. BAD IDEA. I have had food poising for 2 days now and I know it was their food because that meal was the only thing I consumed that day other than bottled water. Don&#39;t go here trust me I have been through hell, vomiting, with a huge headache and plus my husband called them to let them know of the incident and the manager did not even apologize, she was very argumentative and rude. WILL NEVER GO THERE AGAIN.	0
Had to try this place after reading so many good reviews.<br><br>The food is on par with any Chinese take out restaurant. I had the fried dumplings, and scallion pancakes. As someone had stated, the non fried dishes would have been the better choice.<br><br>We noticed that the hot sauce and condiments were very watered down, and stayed clear away from that. Describing the place as dirty may be an understatement (does not effect how I rate the overall restaurant food experience). It ranks up there with Joe Shanghai in terms of sanitary upkeep.<br><br>The hole in the wall setting felt a lot like the tight spaces of Gray&#39;s Papaya. It serves the neighborhood well, where everyone can grab a quick bite at reasonable prices.<br><br>When ordering, come prepared with a little Mandarin. And, yes I think the owners are just messing with you because they understand you perfectly fine when you say &#34;Chun Yao Bang&#34;, and they repeat &#34;One scallion pancakes.&#34;<br><br>If you know the difference between good Chinese food and average Chinese food, this place is not something to die for. Many Yelpers may have been hoodwinked by the hand drawn noodle making process. (Heck, Subway restaurants bake all their bread on the premise. You won&#39;t see me giving them any extra stars for that.)	0
Pretty solid. The blue crab taco was my favorite. I just wished the truffle fries had a bit more flavor to them.....but, I&#39;LL BE BACK!	1
I like Marination Ma Kai. They have great Spam sliders, and the fries are good too. Their menu is easy, the staff is friendly and the food is good.	1
I loves me some Sa-Bai Thong. I might love it as much as I love Vientiane Palace, and that's saying something.	0
The bouncer we encountered here is a jerk.<br><br>We wanted stop by for a drink and he told us we weren&#39;t allowed in even for a quick drink. <br><br>One of our companions was pregnant and needed to use the restroom. He said &#34;no&#34; and didn&#39;t care.<br><br>Never going stop by for a drink ever because of this bouncer&#39;s &#34;Hollywood&#34; attitude.	0
They would not accommodate my girlfriend&#39;s or my allergies. Guy at counter cut me off and made a snide comment about me &#34;probably being ok&#34; when I asked if there was anything I was allergic to in their breakfast sandwich. Refused to listen to a request for corn tortillas instead of bread for my gluten-free girlfriend. Cut me off mid-question. Said something about a small kitchen. After spending the night in the ER two days ago for a severe allergic reaction, I have no patience for this sort of treatment. <br><br>Ate a mediocre breakfast sandwich on a table that hadn&#39;t been cleaned for 2 parties.<br><br>This place disgusts me.	0
I had a great lunch food and services was truly 5 Star	0
Servers were very professional, the sea bass and desserts were great. Compliments to the kitchen staff. Food and overall service was well timed. Gorgeous view. Definitely a good place to take your partner	0
I don't like to give bad reviews because I know how much businesses rely on yelp. This place seemed heavy on the concept and light on the customer experience. The "flow" of the restaurant makes no sense. You stand in line to order, then find a table for them to serve you. All the water and things are back over by the door (not just past where you order) so you have to double back. Its like they are trying to copy Urth cafe (also slow) or Native Foods (same concept, much faster) but you don't have anyone to ask to find the water and to speak to if there is a problem with your food. I felt like I was interrupting someone else from their job to get answers to find basic things.	0
So I am actually changing my review, I used to rant and rave about this spot, they have good sandwiches the pizza is good too, but the service is horrible and non respncive, I ordered a sandwich they said the wait would be 30 min, after an hour I called and the guy was like so 10 more min, called back 20 min later and was like forget it I don't want the order anymore he was rude and all I can say is forget Pasquale's, go to Villa Roma accross the street or better yet order domino's same quality better service.	0
A neighborhood surprise. We came here last minute and it was fantastic. The owner was accommodating and pointed us to the best dishes on the menu. Carrot soup, croquetas, empanadas, grilled steak and chorizo that will make 2 hours seem like 20 minutes. Give this LES spot a try, you won&#39;t regret it.	1
I think I was addicted to this place for a while. The chicken was so terrific, crispy and savory. I may never go back to an American fried chicken place again. I even like the radishes that come with a meal, they're even better than fries.A note: watch for parking. The store is in a place with parking but every time I went to the place the parking lot was pretty full so you may need to park on the street, which means meters.	1
meh.	0
Drinks are good on the rooftop bar. Downstairs is a club at night/on weekends. But as usual in Miami, poor snobby service ruins this place. Or maybe its the rude snobby customers who frequent this place? Or maybe its both?<br><br>Maybe its the Miami culture...?<br>Maybe the customers are rude and snobby so staff gets fed-up...?<br>Maybe they are used to tourists and transient people so they don&#39;t worry or care about good service...?<br>Maybe there is not enough competition in the Miami/Brickell area so they don&#39;t care...?<br>Maybe the population for whatever reason just doesn&#39;t know what good service and class is...?<br><br>Nevertheless the mojitos are great upstairs and some of the bartenders are cool/nice. They also know how to make a martini (hard to find) and it is not too loud upstairs on some nights so you can actually have a nice drink and a conversation.	0
Went to this place tonight and had been here before when it was Chop Suey so figured out we would try it out. Came here with 8 other people and it was completely slow their was only 2 other small parties so we figured we would get our food and drinks quickly boy were we wrong! So first we order our drinks and they take 10-15 minutes to bring them and when we got our beer it was warm. We also had order food which was Mac and cheese lollipops a burger and our friends had order some curry, clam chowder soup and sushi rolls. Well ten minutes come by an our waitress TRACIE let's us know that they don't have Mac and Cheese or Curry. So then we just wait for our burger and sushi rolls well 20 minutes pass by and still no food mind you we had already waited 20 minutes so it was basically a 40 minute wait just to get our burger and sushi rolls. So we ended up just canceling our food since all our friends had finish eating. Well when we cancelled our food our waitress TRACIE decides she wants to argue with my friend and say "OH No it hasn't been more then ten minutes." When clearly it was longer some people that had arrived after us were already eating all their food so clearly it was longer then ten minutes. I DO NOT!! RECOMMEND THIS PLACE! If you decided to come make sure you don't get TRACY as your waitress she was beyond Rude and a Horrible waitress!!!!	0
I don&#39;t know what it is about this place, but anyone that likes it is brain washed. After hearing about how amazing Steve&#39;s Pizza is from a couple of co-workers I decided to drag my husband down to North Miami to try it. There was a bit of a line but nothing intolerable. Once we placed our order and received our drinks we proceeded to sit down. I found the entire restaurant pretty dirty and at this point I began to lose my appetite. The pizza finally came out and it looked delicious so I started to feel better about eating. Well it looked delicious but it wasn&#39;t. The pizza is so disgustingly greasy. The sauce was really sweet for my taste but I suppose others might like it that way. We managed to only get through 2 slices and brought the rest home. For about 2 days after I felt like I had drank a bottle of oil and it was just sitting at the back of my throat. Reheating the pizza made it even more greasy. I will never eat at Steve&#39;s Pizza again.	0
Okay food, prices and portions but the service is AWFUL.<br><br>The first time i went, the restaurant was full. Instead of telling us to please wait, the staff completely ignored us, leaving us at the door. When we spoke up to ask how long it&#39;ll take, a server CUT US OFF MID-SENTENCE and then...went back to ignoring us. We were being extremely polite, just asking how long we would have to wait, but he angrily snapped at us, as though we did something wrong. It was beyond rude. We were actually shocked by the service, so we just left. <br><br>We went back the second time thinking the first time was a fluke but, once again, we were ignored. It wasn&#39;t until a little bit later when we were finally seated. The food took forever (30min for 2 entrees--and on this afternoon there weren&#39;t many people). When it came time for the check, I saw the European girls and family to my left and right ask for their check and have it delivered to their table. So, I requested mine as well. Three times to the same person! I never got my check and had to go to the front to pay. I don&#39;t know if they expect me to pay at the front because that&#39;s asian style, and I&#39;m Chinese, but, if so, it was a little upsetting that I was treated differently. The man I asked for the check from could have also told me the second time I asked instead of agreeing to bring the check each time, then not bringing it. I was left waiting at my table confused as to what to do when the servers promised to bring the bill but never came. <br><br>I won&#39;t come again because, although the food is good, I can find food just as good food at places nearby with much better service.	0
Came here on a chilly Wednesday night as I heard it had just opened in the area and was eager to check it out. I&#39;m glad I did.<br><br>The craft cocktails were unbelievable... really interesting flavors and colors made with unique ingredients. Definitely gives all of the classic NYC mixology places a run for their money.<br><br>The food is latin american with a twist... We had the guac (must-order), the montaditos, the empanada, sliders, and the flan.... everything was incredible and the presentation was spectacular.<br><br>Would strongly suggest you grab a table here before the word gets out!	1
I've eaten at the Grove a few times now, and while everyone else seems to love this place, the only thing I like about it are the large opening windows. The food is not interesting and not good. Prime example: they don't shred the cheese for their grilled cheese sandwiches. Having attended a class on grilled cheese seminar by American cheese expert Laura Werlin, I know that a good grilled cheese sandwich is made by shredding the cheese so that it melts perfectly. The Grove failed at this and my sandwich was very sub-par. The soups and salads have also not been great.So, if you're in the area and want a place to sit by a nice big window with a drink, go to the Grove. If you want food, go elsewhere.	0
All I had was the pepperoni pizza here which was sooooo delicious! I definitely need to come back and try some other stuff.	1
The food is pretty good, but service is slow and its a bit overpriced for what you get really	1
Unfortunately, we realized when the next customers were seated that the service was not up to par. We were never told the lunch specials  or offered a refill of our bread...like the table next to us. But we are aware that one of the waitresses is looking at an apartment, moves all the time, takes the bus now, and won't mind taking the train. The loud conversation of the wait staff filled the empty resturant and overpowered our tables conversation.  We were looking forward to some great Italian dishes, however, my husbands pasta was undercooked. Come on...it's pasta! My risotto was wonderful, but the pork shank literally had 4 bites of meat on it. I realize it was resturant week special but quality/quantity should not be compromised. We visited two more Italian restaurants in the north end over the weekend and I must say the food and service blew this experience away.	0
In all of my 34+ years of dining in Los Angeles, this place has the hands down worst customer service I have ever experienced. All of the negative reviews below are 100% spot on, so there is no reason to repeat what has already been well documented. But I would like to add that in addition to the horrific customer service, ineffective / non-existent management and poorly prepared food, this restaurant is so negligent in their practices and care of customers that they have even failed at elementary items such as providing soap and paper towels in the restroom. This is beyond disgusting and completely unacceptable. I called in excess of 10 times to discuss the above, as I usually do not take the time to write reviews, but despite being promised numerous times that an owner or manager will return my call, no attempt was ever made.	0
Awful service! My server was clueless. It wasn't even busy yet it took him 15 mins to come to our table. Then he never once came back to check in. I was there for brunch. My sister's eggs were like rubber and my fruit plate had so much fresh mint on it that I couldn't taste the fruit. I really wanted to like this place but it's never going to happen. Worst place I have been to in a long time.	0
forgot to update this. The problem mentioned was addressed, i've since been back many many times and never had an issue.Will be a customer as long as I live in LA!	1
Crowded hipster "gastropub." Christ, doesn't Hollywood have enough of these? Beer was uninteresting and served up in plastic cups (is this a thing now? Really?). Had some kind of bacon cheeseburger onion ring thing: nothing to write home about. Was good: not great, not bad, not memorable, not interesting. Fries were the same. Dump all you want on fries: they're still fries. If you want to see bearded 30 and 40-somethings with band t-shirts drinking "craft beer" with their sig. others and offspring in an atmosphere that's one part high school cafeteria, two parts why-the-Hell-did-I-come-here, this is the place for you.	0
Wonderful pizza - even the crust had amazing flavor! Prova also has a simple, modern environment. However, hopefully you enjoy your neighbors. They&#39;ll be close.	1
LOVE. Excellent pizza, chicken (so tender and buttery), and of course the BREAD. You MUST try their bread pudding for dessert. Just do it.	1
The price and service would not have been an issue in overall ranking if the food was better quality	0
Best, freshest soups and salads in Madison. A great place to dine for lunch if you have the patience to wait for a table. The food is ALWAYS outstanding, however the restaurant can be busy and noisy (cement everywhere).	0
Picked Perch for dinner after a tradeshow. We had 8:30 reservations on a Thursday. The place was busy but not packed. Our table was waiting for us when we arrived. I made the reservation through Open Table and requested to be sat outside to enjoy their famous views. Our table was just barely outside. Next time I will ask to be seated near the fireplace. We had the pork belly appetizer, two glasses of pinot noir, steak frites, scallops and chocolate custard. Bill came to $125. Our server was helpful and allowed us to take our time. Being 34 I thought the place might be crawling with 20 somethings. It was a nice surprise to find a mixed crowd. The staff made me feel comfortable even though I wasn't wearing my 5 in CFM shoes! I can't wait to go back again for Sunday brunch with the girls.	1
Hand-formed pizzas were delicious. We shared a Margherita (more basil per favore) and a Sorrento pizza. Never had prosciutto on pizza but it's salty flavor mixed with the sweet of the fresh tomato sauce was like a tarantella for the mouth!	1
i expected more from Toast based on the Yelp reviews and great location. i ordered a mediocre omelette and tea, and was, obviously, disappointed.the service was fast and friendly with nice outdoor seating, but the meal itself was "blah". great restaurant for people watching though!	0
Surprised dad for lunch and took him for a burger and fries. He mentioned it was alright, at best. The bun got soggy quick and the burger fell apart so it got hard to eat. Can't say if I would ever go back or not, ok not! Second star goes to the nice family that owns it but foods just not that good.	0
Good burgers, I like the thicker Fries they didn't have them but never a bad choice.	1
Thanks yelp! You came through for us and we were not disappointed with our spontaneous choice for Thai tonight! We ordered panang curry chicken(amazing!) coconut soup(more coconut flavor than expected..in a good way), and Thai doughnuts all delicious. Thai doughnuts not as fat and fluffy as others I&#39;ve had...think more like flat pillows than fluffy clouds; but it still satisfied my sweet tooth! :) Family owned place and very friendly. We had never been here before but will definitely be returning to try more of the menu. Like others have already said, it&#39;s a hole in the wall and not much atmosphere, but the food is great and we ordered take out so....bypass the atmosphere and enjoy your take out!	1
Where else can you go to satisfy your craving for ramen and burger after 9 pm on a Sunday night, but here! No traffic, no hassle parking and California Donuts is just around the corner--perfect for dessert. The thought of blending my two loves, ramen and burgers, is a match made in food heaven. I tried the original ramen and the spicy burgers. I'm not a fan of spicy so I prefer the original ramen which was delicious!	1
I am serious about this. I lived in Los Angeles 24 years ago. Moved back to my native Portland, OR (currently the little foodie-darling capital of the world) and never thought I&#39;d ever be in LA again this life time. However, here I am, unexpectedly -- on business -- and I am visiting all of my old food haunts. Basic bare bones truth: Canter&#39;s simply R O C K S !!! Anybody who comes into Canters and complains, or leaves less than 4 stars, is clueless. My review will probably not make it past the Yelp editors, and so be it. Truth is truth. If you dis Canters, you are a clueless moron. Thank you.	1
I ordered a chicken fried rice and seafood soup &amp; noodle as a delivery. My bf got it and told me about taste.<br>Fried rice was just okay but soup&amp;noodle was delicious. :D I&#39;ll try other one too next time.	1
When Toast first opened, there was a rumor among us NYC ex-pats that it was being run by the same delicious hands that brought us our beloved Magnolia Bakery. That this was ever true seems more and more dubious a claim. True, there are cupcakes to be bought that *look* a lot like Magnolia's, but a single bite tells you these are either Magnolia's 2-day-old leftovers, that much worse for the wear of shipping, or just crap LA imitations. Beside the disappointing cupcakes, there's a whole dining experience just waiting to bum you out. From the throngs of clueless hipster clones driving wait times into the stratosphere, to the often rude service, to the overpriced diner food that will, eventually, reach your table. Save yourself the time and frustration. The long line here is in no way an indication of desirability.	0
Absolutely outstanding!  Service and food top notch. Since we already knew about the family style portions, having been to the one in NY, the waiter did not need to explain. 5 stars!	1
Ordered the Bratwurst, they served it to me raw on the inside, as in cold and uncooked. Waiting the next 12 hours to see if I&#39;m going to get any food poisoning. I would avoid this place at all costs!	0
Had some great fried chicken and fish and chips (my favorite...possibly of all time?). Beware though: The portions are HUGE. The fried chicken dinner could easily feed two people, IMO.	1
Note* this place is categorized as a lounge and not as a restaurant- the food service reflects this. Great Ambiance and good drinks redeem the 4th star	1
One word... cockroaches.	0
Overly priced cafe/diner items that are flavorless and colorless. So bland and extremely disappointing.	0
I will never go there ever again...!!!!Service was okay.!! But the food is literally disgusting... I don't mind paying a high price but they need a new cook for sure.!!Only thing was good chicken soup, that's all... Rest is garbage....	0
A friend of mine recommended me this place after we went shopping at Saks.<br>I am glad I listened to her. I had a Shrimp Roll and it was delicious, the shrimp was delicious and fresh. I had the offer that goes with chips and soda, because they had some sort of Whole Foods type of sodas and i usually never drink soda anyway but they had something with Lemon and Lime.<br>It was a nice and light dinner. Get ready to pay $10 for a snaky time of dinner. Upscale Sea Hot Dog!	1
This place is brand new, but I can tell it will be around for a very long time.<br><br>Everyone is very committed to detail and quality. Not something you normally get at a &#34;hamburger joint&#34;.<br><br>The food is really good, it&#39;s clean, service is quick and everyone is very friendly.<br><br>I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll become a regular whenever I&#39;m in downtown Miami	1
A relatively small bar that gets super busy. It can be a bit hard finding a seat, so watch closely for someone to leave and sit down before anyone has a chance to get there!The bartenders are very laid-back and efficient. Sybil was our bartender that night and we eventually just asked her to give us shots of whatever she felt like making. She did a good job getting two of my friends drunk and gave us glasses of water (& kept refilling!) to keep them hydrated. Drinks are strong for a good price. Definitely want to try the Flaming Lamborghini one day, but I don't want to lose my eyebrows ;)Wasabi fries.. were okay. I liked the fries. Not a fan of wasabi. You can try to find parking on the streets or just park in the structure nearby.	1
My sister and I were very impressed with our lunch at Strada. The wait staff was friendly and professional, the food was absolutely delicious, and it&#39;s lovely to sit out on Commodore with a view of the gorgeous Cruz building and the Grove bustling around you. And for the outstanding quality of the dining experience the prices are quite reasonable.<br><br>They take food seriously at Strada - we ordered a range of items - freshly made pasta, a grilled sandwich, and mushroom risotto. Every dish we got was beautifully presented and exhibited well balanced, subtle, fresh flavors. This is without a doubt one of the best restaurants in the Grove.	1
If you could have sex with Katrina Bowden, then take that experience and turn it into a burger you could shove into your mouth, then that would be the Truffle Burger at Umami. After eating it I became very upset with other burger places for slacking, to the point where I ordered another burger, walked into Jack n The Box, threw it at the chef and told them to get their sh*t together. Make a commercial about that.	1
This was quite a busy place tonight! Usually, if you have to wait for a seat in a restaurant then you must know it's good. So we totally didn't mind waiting a bit for our table of 5 tonight.Overall, the sushi, food, and service was good!	1
we had delicious dinner at the Grill room! Thank you very much Adam for a great service!	1
I really wanted to like this place because it&#39;s walking distance from my house. But the food is just so mediocre and bland. &#34;It&#39;s all about the bread&#34; on melrose is infinitely better. I&#39;ve eaten here three times to insure they were not having an off day and I&#39;m baffled by the ratings.	0
We went for a quick lunch after custom ordering a new Bentley GT! We sat at the bar- waitstaff very attentive and efficient. Friendly fellow at the raw bar. I ordered a dozen oysters and a few other appetizers. Save for the oysters the rest of the food was a greasy mess. I have yet to walk out of this restaurant not feeling yucky. Sadly, I had to make a quick pharmacy run for some alka-seltzer. I won&#39;t give this place another chance. ack!	0
Modern and clean ambiance, nice menu and fair prices. Service was smooth and prompty without bothering. Great option for a casual business or personal dinner. Probably not as impressive as other alternatives in the region but definitely provides a pleasant and distinguished impression.	1
I got very bad food poisoning from here and made me sick for 3 days making me not able to eat anymore in Miami and sick on the entire 12 hour drive back home. None of my friends got sick, so maybe I was the unlucky one, but I won&#39;t be going back. So I&#39;d take it with caution if you eat here.	0
We used to order delivery and take-out from these guys ALL the time...like, embarrassingly all. They make some good pizzas (Dante&#39;s Revenge and Midnight in the Garden) - kind of a thick, doughy pizza experience which isn&#39;t my fave, but creative and tasty.<br>That said, WOW they are jerks! one night our pizza arrived and it was...raw. As in, uncooked dough, literally cold, raw dough in the center. YUCK.<br>I called and nicely said the pizza was &#34;undercooked&#34;. The guy I spoke to (who seemed to be a manager or even owner of some kind) was incredibly rude. Not once did he even say&#34;sorry&#34; or &#34;we want to make this right&#34;..what he said was &#34;I will send another pizza if you can prove (yes he said PROVE) that you didn&#39;t eat the first one, and give that one back to us.&#34;<br>Excuse me? You think I ate your disgusting, cold-in-the-center, stuck-to-its-box, Pillsbury Doughboy on a bad day crust pizza and called just to scam some more? Or that I want to keep the pizza, just for kicks or because it&#39;s suitable for framing? OF COURSE YOU CAN HAVE IT BACK. But don&#39;t start by blaming the customer.<br>I didn&#39;t get an apology from the dude who delivered the marginally less soggy replacement, either, and they did take the bad pizza. I bet Purgatory reheated it and delivered it to someone else.<br>We haven&#39;t ordered since.<br>At least they are aptly named.	0
Worst experience ever. Keep going. Just keep walking. Kitchen nightmare. No drink refills. We kept ordering things and then after plenty of time to make the item - we find out they don&#39;t offer it anymore. <br><br>Happy hour? Nope.<br>Brunch? Nope.<br>Half the menu? Nope.<br>Sushi? Nope.	0
Simply put, their tacos are bad.	0
Food is OKAY.<br><br>More so than the food, place is great for date night. Tree in the middle of the outside patio of the restaurant= why not? Very intimate. Location is a little hard to find (as most of the restaurants in silver lake area.	1
Used to love the mayo-free tuna sandwhich, however, just got food poisining from the grove on 3/31/11. That is the only thing I had that day, so it was definitely from the grove. To top things off, the person I had lunch with there, ALSO got food posining. So there's some serious sanitation issues going on behind the scenes. BEWARE!!	0
Came here on a random day and tried the 39. I&#39;ll be back here again very soon. The employees were polite and very quick with the order. My friend ordered the chilli cheese combo and he wasn&#39;t to satisfied. It&#39;s OK, not the greatest in the world but alright.	0
Great food great service. Nearly perfect meal and service . Will be back	1
Umami burger has to be my favorite burger joint ever. The truffle burger is a meaty cheesie perfection and their buns are always soOo fluffie and toastie mmm!!! I also recommend the hatch and cali burger. Add some thin fries with your order and your good to go!!!	1
Awesome place for a casual dinner. The only reason I don't give them 5 stars is that they have a communal table, which I am not personally a fan of. But we had our own table on a Monday night and the food was delicious. Perhaps the only disappointment (and it was mild at best) was the salmon cakes, which were more cake than salmon, but that is personal preference. The Vanilla Roasted Beets were delicious. The Steak Frites and Short Ribs (on the seasonal menu in July) were both really delicious, and my husband would go back for the parmesan truffle fries alone. If this place had a full bar and was in walking distance of my house, I would be on a first name basis with everyone. I already know at least 5 menu items I want to go back and try.	1
I came here on a Sat night for their grand opening, which i heard about through some friends. I came expecting an ordinary grilled cheese and was quite impressed to find that it&#39;s much more than your typical salty and greasy comfort food. Pulled pork grilled cheese was perfectly crispy on the outside while the cheese was melted just right. I also loved that the pork wasn&#39;t overpowering. Another dish I tried was some type of tater tots with fried egg on top. O.M.G. that&#39;s all I gotta say. I&#39;m definitely taking my friends to try this next time.<br><br>Oh, and I wasn&#39;t surprised to learn that the chefs who run the place are classically trained aiming to make some comfort food with 5 - star skills.	1
very tasty, healthy and decently priced. I like most items on their menu. definitely recommend!	1
My fellow Yelpers! I reviewed a place back in August of 2013 called Matt's at the Market downtown Seattle on the third floor of a building on the corner of 1st and Pike St. Well, I also mentioned a sister restaurant called Radiator Whiskey which is actually a cocktail bar on steroids just across the hall from Matt's and owned by the same proprietor Dan Bugge. Very Cool! Dan purchased Matt's about eight years ago and kept the original name. Radiator Whiskey is his new creation that opened on April 17th, 2012 with a very unique style in gourmet eats. Radiator Whiskey has embraced a company called 2Bar Spirits, a local distillery just south of Seattle, to create a house whiskey that is available at different stages of maturity. Radiator typically carries fifty bourbons, twenty ryes, ten Irish whiskeys, fifty single malt scotches and a variety of everything else you would normally find in a bar including wine and beer. Wow!	1
We were showing a friend from out of town the LinQ and have heard exciting things about the Brooklyn Bowl and wanted to check it out.  We were promptly greeted and showed up stairs to the Hostess.  There was a little confusion in seating us, and after walking through the dining area, we were turned around and seated at a booth we had already passed.  After sitting for more than 10 minutes without any acknowledgement by any one (the hostess passed the table twice) we took our friend to another restaurant in the area where we were well served.	0
Perch is a fun place for hanging out and getting a few drinks around downtown LA. My friends and I arrived around 11 PM on a Saturday night, and thankfully, we didn&#39;t really have that long a line to wait on. The guys checking people&#39;s IDs were very immature, though, but that&#39;s a slight hiccup. You go up two different elevators to get to Perch, and once we were inside I was reminded of another rooftop bar I&#39;ve been to in Minneapolis (yes, THAT Minneapolis): classic yet trendy decor (with lots of birds, of course), moody lighting, a lovely buzz from all the patrons, with the added bonus of a DJ and a drummer on one corner. Drinks are around what I expected; spent $25 for three drinks, one of which was ginger ale. Everyone wanted to be outside, and we were lucky enough to grab a couple of chairs and create a makeshift seating area by the glass barriers. We had a gorgeous view of the financial district, and it was just warm enough, but you could also sit by the outdoor fireplace if you&#39;d like. Just a lovely place to hang and catch up with friends. Oh, and I especially liked my mojito; mr. bartender did it right with the perfect blend of everything.	1
Much better than last time with new manager new menu items. The asparagus tempura didn't work but the hanger steak sure did.	1
I had dinner here the other night. We walked right in - no reservation. It took FOREVER to get our food due to some miscommunication with the kitchen. This was difficult to swallow, but they tried to make it right with numerous apologies and a free order of deviled eggs which was nice. <br><br>I had a biscuit sandwich with fried green tomato and shrimp and fried okra on the side. It was very good. My friend had a chicken pot pie. She really liked it. I had a nice glass (or two) of Lambrusco. <br><br>Would love to return.	1
Great bar food! They have a great karaoke night & its a fun atmosphere! So happy this bar is in the Palms area.	1
I literally wanted everything on the menu! <br>Monica the owner is super cool and treated us like we were family/close friends. Intimate/romantic setting with a divey twist. I&#39;ll be back to try more things on the menu :)	1
Botero was incredible. Elegant ambience, exceptional service, delicious food and great wine selection.	1
I used to walk to this cart when I worked on Madison Avenue - it is so yum! Hmm, I might even make it a stop this summer. It&#39;s worth the walk! <br><br>Anyway, here&#39;s a couple of easy-to-follow tips:<br><br>1. Go early (or much later). The closer you go to peak lunch time (noon!), the longer that line will be. I suggest heading over there early - or going after the lunch rush.<br><br>2. Know what you want. They move fast here.. so stuttering over whether you want extra tzatziki or not ... or deciding if you want a pita or a platter.. generally gets you some dirty looks from other people on line. Have what you want to order in mind and shout it out when it&#39;s your turn.<br><br>3. Get lots of napkins. Oh, the gyro is deliciously messy so be prepared!<br><br>Otherwise, enjoy! :]	1
Love the fact that didn&#39;t have to wait long and it was packed! The food was yummy and waitress was exceptional.	1
i have been to 909 on several occasions and i love the fresh pastries they serve. The coffee is good the service and the neighborhood feel all make it worth going to. i have also been there for wine and was very well attended too...	1
Dosas were good most other food was disappointing. Not bad just not special. I had a chicken dish marked as a specialty that was the most uninteresting bland food I've ever had. No heat at all even though it was supposed to be 4 stars.	0
Went for brunch here. Out $15 plus tax and tip (cool $20) for coffee and a piece of toast with one poached egg, asparagus, and bacon on top. It tasted decent, but I think I&#39;ve had appetizers with more food than that.<br><br>Decor &amp; atmosphere is nice and peaceful. I would go here for just coffee if the owners were cool with it, but brunch really isn&#39;t worth it. For $20, I&#39;ll go elsewhere.	0
My wife and I left dinner at Nojo extremely disappointed. I really wanted to like this place because they have a good idea, a descent location and I like their fresh and seasonal ingredients approach from local suppliers. The problem is with the execution. I can't remember the last time I had such a bland meal. We ordered seven different items and somewhat enjoyed only two of them, and only one of those two would I consider re-ordering.Salad: Chicories, Cauliflower, Lemon-Soy Vinaigrette & Shaved Katsuo Bushi - Very Bitter TasteChicken Breast on a stick and Chicken Thigh on a stick - Bland with no seasoningTsukune: Ground chicken with egg yolk soy sauce - Okay, but not greatChawanmushi - Bland with poor texture. The very small piece of crab tasted like crab but the rest of the dish had no flavorTempura of Vegetables - Delicious and the only thing I could recommend orderingWhite Miso Glazed Trout - Well cooked piece of fish but, again, lacking any sort of seasoningI don't remember what the last dish we had was, but it was basically rice served in a bowl of water. It was supposedly green tea infused but I could not pick up any flavor other than white rice.I am hoping that other people have good experiences here and that the restaurant makes improvements because I want to see them do well, but I can not under good conscience recommend Nojo to anyone.	0
First time here! Satisfied customer. I will come back here again! Healthy choice and fun to make your own spring roll! We made a good choice today. 5 stars!	1
I felt like I was in my own BATMAN RETURNS movie. Where I'm having fine dining with the love of my life (who is batman), with the view of Gotham city (eerie yet romanitc), on top of a building.And then someone tries to kidnap me so Batman flies down the balcony (where the outdoor restaurant is) and saves the day while I continue to eat my skirt steak w/ cocktail in hand.Yeahhh... that was my experience. You'll feel like you aren't in downtown LA, or even in california....I loved this place.	1
great service	1
I had a great experience here. We were seated right away, service was great. We order the prime rib and kobe beef. It was delicious! The portions are a little small but you have to expect that with a french restaurant. I enjoyed the ambiance and the character of the place. I'd recommend this place for lunch, early dinner.	1
not bad, just uneven. on three visits it was all over the place - some excellent crudo, some eh, same goes for pasta.	0
Fraudulent charges. 2 pounds of brisket at 25 dollars a pound. Nice try. Your BS prices are now put up for public to view. Credit card disputing charges. <br><br>Watch what they charge you and don&#39;t be intimidated. They are liars and cheats, that is guaranteed.	0
You can never go wrong with 4.99 steak and eggs!<br><br>Only con was when I asked for egg whites only and they charged me an extra dollar. I can&#39;t complain though, it&#39;s just a dollar. BUTTT I could&#39;ve played slots with that dollar hahahha <br><br>Ricardo was a sweetheart and besides the extremely long wait for food (which should be expected due to the large volume of drunks coming in for cheap food), it was a great experience! Steak was chewier than my likings but still.. 4.99 steak and eggs! cant complain!	1
LOVE the happy hour, food and atmosphere.<br><br>However, be VERY careful with the wait staff on taking turns serving your table - especially the chick from Valencia, Spain.<br><br>You order a couple of $5 wines during happy hour, and wind up having to pay half a dozen on your tab. No kidding, this happened to me tonight. <br><br>And the worst part about it is that you MUST pay the tab complete with cocktails you never ordered or enjoyed. The swindle? &#34;We&#39;ll review the cameras tomorrow and get back to you on how many drinks you ordered.&#34;<br><br>Believe it. NUTS. So - my advice to you is to make sure to write down on a cocktail napkin whenever they serve you a drink (in other words, keep your own tab) and make sure to tell this waitress whenever she brings you a cocktail what your number count is - so you are on the same page.<br><br>Otherwise, you WILL be paying a hefty bar tab and wait for the reimbursement to come later on, which will never come.<br><br>Shame on you Balans. I know times are hard, but I thought you were classier than this.	0
The worst service ever. Food is so-so. A very much village style. And they include 15% gratuity be default. Void them. Don&#39;t get fooled.	0
We had one of my best friends grandmas 90th birthday here with a large group and they treated us amazingly! They set up a special area just for us and catered to our every need. Truly amazing<br>The special menu they created for us was perfect with a variety of options for everyone. Food was great! I was impressed how they were able to cook so much amazing food for our large party and each plate was perfectly put together. At the end, the chef came out to wish grandma a happy birthday!<br>Definitely will be back!	1
Friendly service, clean environment. Took 23 minutes for me to get a latte. Coffee was just okay...	0
I live across the street. Awesome authentic food and love love the salsa they put on the tacos/fries. Potato taco and carne asada fries are my fav!	1
This place has an awesome location and view, but the food needs major improvement. The omelette and homefries I had were way underseasoned and overcooked. The food here is cheap and quick to come out to the table, but there are better breakfast places out there.	0
$40 Family style meal that consisted of bread and more bread in a room that was not air conditioned so you are sweaty and uncomfortable the whole time. I could have possibly overlooked the heat if this was an off day that the AC was broken, but I see from earlier reviews from other Yelpers that they obviously don&#39;t care about the comfort of their patrons because this has been an ongoing issue for at least a month now. And seeing how hot it was, they provided water with no ice, we had to ask for a glass of ice every time. Bad AC aside, the food was no better, the meal started off OK and just kept getting worse and worse.<br><br>They serve a basket of bread to go with the bruschetta appetizer, this will be an ongoing theme for the rest of the meal.<br><br>2oz fresh burrata - I&#39;m a fan of burrata but this was one of the bad ones. First it was a MEASELY 2 oz they provided for four people to share, I&#39;m not sure where the $40 of the meal was coming from, but it&#39;s def not from the half ounce I had. It was not creamy, more like water and came with champagne grapes, not sure what those were for either, probably just for decoration because they added nothing to the dish. (Grapes will be a returning theme for this meal)<br><br>Za&#39;atar and sumac lebni - The menu said pecornio in this, but I didn&#39;t see or taste any of that. I&#39;m not sure how to describe this dish, it was an herby/spice like topping for the bread. The flavors were actually good and came with a cooling yogurt cream on the side too.<br><br>Jerk style chicken liver - Did not taste the &#34;jerk&#34; seasoning or flavor, actually my first thought was that it tasted like a McDonald&#39;s chicken nugget. The batter was a little thick for me and not evenly coated at all. Some bites I had was all chicken liver and no batter, and others was all batter. This was on a bed of greens with pickled red onions (another running theme in the meal)<br><br>My favorite items from the meal were the salads. <br>Caesar brussel sprouts - Finely shredded and with a lot of pecornio, not too heavy on the anchovy or garlic though. Although my fellow diners kept saying &#34;would have been better with bacon&#34;. <br><br>Charred gem lettuce - The description said coriander leaf dressing, feta and watermelon. What we got looked more like a caesar salad. I thought gem lettuce was the bib lettuce, what we got looked more like plain romaine. And no watermelon, instead had pickled yellow beets and pickled red onions (again). I didn&#39;t mind the taste of this but it was not what was promised/advertised per their menu.<br><br>Baco - They brought out this platter of meats and the fava fritters for our table of 9. It did not look like a lot of food, meat wise it did not, but they give out these warm flat breads (more bread) for you to make sandwiches with, along with a set of four dipping sauces. The dipping sauces were Meh to me. There was a chipotle mayo one, a salsa, a chimichurri which I&#39;ve had better and can make better, and another sauce that I couldn&#39;t identify (because no one bothered to tell us, just plopped the food in front and left) but it wasn&#39;t that tasty to me anyways so I didn&#39;t care to find out.<br>On to the Baco meats! The fried pork belly was nothing special. I&#39;ve had better at hole in the wall places. The braised beef was also fried, it was crispy on the outside but still tender on the inside, too bad not much flavor. Worst was the fava fritters. I don&#39;t know what the hype is about these, they are just balls of fried mushed up fava beans. Again the description said there was cheese in it, but I didn&#39;t taste any of that. Everyone was slathering the mayo sauce on their Baco because that was the only way to make it decently palatable. The bread was also too heavy, you can see from my picture I had a plate full of uneaten bread at the end of my meal.<br><br>Mixed Coca - Another dish that did not come out as described on the menu and of course more BREAD! These are basically flat bread pizzas.<br>The tomato and cheese said it had smoked jalapeno and basil, definitely did not taste any jalapeno, they must have substituted it with the pickled red onion (yes again!) that was on there and a sprig of dill. <br>The cream of mushroom one was better, it had a good amount of cheese and mushroom and the &#34;sauce&#34; was a blended puree of mushrooms which was different. It lacked salt though or something to highlight all the flavors. <br><br>Meal ended with dessert which the menu said seasonal fruit crumble w semifredo. I was looking forward to this since sweating the entire meal for some FROZEN cold dessert. First NO semifreddo, just whipped cream and it was a bowl of peach cobbler with basic crumble topping, too bad it was so undercooked the inside was a mush of hot peach and undercooked flour paste. We complained about this dessert since it was so badly prepared and they brought out two other desserts as consolation, flan and a banana and salted caramel with whipped cream, both of these were much better, but still couldn&#39;t salvage the overall bad meal.	0
I love the Smoked Salmon Sandwich.Cool place...Great Atmosphere. Everything here is so good.Casual and Chic in really France style!!!	1
This place was love at first sight. From the interior design to the drink menu to the guy behind the counter, oh yes, it was love.I want to fold this place up and move it closer to where I live so I can come here every day and fall in love with it over and over. I want to have photo shoots in the interior, start an art gallery in the well-lit center of the room and perhaps have a party here because the look is sleek yet still industrial. As for the menu, balance tea, where would I be without you? Unbalanced, that's for sure. It's a tart blend of black, mint, and fruity teas-- each sip was perfect, no sugar-bath necessary. After oohing-and-aahing at the decor, the barista had me tongue-tied. Somehow I missed the 'mingling with boys' lesson during my four years at an all-girls high school, so I still can't get it together when I am greeted by a cute guy-- especially those with accents. He may have just been taking my order, but in my head, we were in love. Paper or plastik, you have a lady killer in your arsenal of baristas, wield with care or you'll have clueless idiots like me talking in gibberish when we're just trying to order tea. It doesn't matter that my boyfriend took me here. It doesn't matter that he knew I'd love it. The only thing that matters is that I've fallen in love with a coffee/teashop. You'll know what I mean after you listen to Landon Pigg's Falling in Love at a Coffeeshop for reference: . Sigh.	1
It was my first time so I got the Taste of Maine. The lobster roll was definitely the highlight of the meal. The shrimp and crab rolls were just ok and the crab had small pieces of shell in it. Next time I will stick to the lobster. I recommend getting it as a meal. The kettle chips are actually crispy and NOT hard! So hard to find good kettle chips these days. I also tried the blueberry soda (yay) and the ginger brew (nay).	1
We come to Vegas every year for the NFR. Benihanas is our favorite place because of the food, personalities of staff (especially the chefs), atmosphere and locale. We always share a table with others and it is great!! We shared a table with 12 people from Portugal on Monday night and we had a blast! Our chef, Kevin, made the night. Even though they couldn't understand him, he made them laugh. Our food was excellent. He made sure we were taken care of. I always recommend Benihanas to everyone I know. Keep up the great work! I will be back in January for National Home Builder show, see you then!!!	1
Cold food, slow service, incomplete orders even when the restaurant is full and doubled its size. Not as good as it was.	0
Crappy service. Decent drink selection, but we were the forgotten table so it didn&#39;t matter. Cool location in a dark alley between Asian restaurants. Ordered food, 20 minutes later told that it was 86&#39;d. Other item we ordered was also out. Over it by then, time to go to Wurstkuche instead.	0
I waited outside for 45 minutes to sit at the bar. the food took another 20 minutes. I gave my other half some kisses on the cheek while waiting patiently. When my breakfast arrived which included scrambled eggs to my surprised they threw in some egg shells with my order. No. really. There were egg shell pieces in my scrambled eggs. When I went to pay the lady at the counter made remarks about how I gave a show at the counter with my other half? Um. Maybe I have some remarks about the time I spent waiting for everything and eating egg shells.	0
Great little family place. Food great freashly made at time of order. It does take longer definately don't go if in hurry. Place is small might gave to wait for table. But worth it	1
Priced on the high side for what you get! Needs more seating!!!! Food is good but again pricey especially if you would like to go at least 2 or 3 times a month.	1
Both my experiences here were pleasant and I really like the way my French Vanilla latte is prepared.	1
Outstanding...! This is how gelato should taste.	1
The quiche is silky and custard-y and not dense. Sooooooo delicious! Everything else is amazing too!	1
Atrocious customer service and crap food. Not worth it.The first time I went I had the french toast. It was awful and bland. The second time I went with a large group. We came in separate cars .. and didn't all arrive at the same time. I walked in after some of my friends had already been seated and the hostess started yelling at me. She was upset that I was only one person when my friends had told her there were three more joining the table. The lady wouldn't even let me by to join my party until I'd explained three times that my party was already seated. The place wasn't very busy.. it was pretty late and during the week.. but the hostess refused to let us sit at a larger table until the rest of our party arrived. Instead, we had to pull up a chair to the booth.. getting in the way of the servers. After less than five minutes of waiting, the hostess came over and insisted that we order. She chided us saying that "this is a business .. we can't have people sitting and not ordering."We left right away and went to Fred 62s on Vermont where they were happy to serve us.	0
For the adventurous eater. This had been on my list for a long time, and I attempted to go there twice before finally being able to get in on my third try with an old coworker who was in town for the week. People LOVE this restaurant, so we were very excited to check it out. Unfortunately, we were completely underwhelmed by everything we ordered (which were the most popular items on the menu - salt-roasted beets w/whipped goat cheese; milk braised pork shoulder; and pig&#39;s ear w/crispy kale, pickled cherry peppers and fried egg). Every dish we tried was ridiculously salty to the point where you couldn&#39;t taste much else. Maybe they were having an off night? Either way, very disappointing.	0
If you&#39;re gonna have anything here, you have to have the patacones. They are life changing! Service is fast and thankfully the staff speaks English too.	1
You don't get a menu, which is odd.  Food salty and average at best. Way to pricey for cheap pasta. Mussels tasted like water and garlic	0
Fantastic selection of sausage! Fantastic selection of beer! It&#39;s a must. I can&#39;t wait to get back to try more. I hear the pretzels are also amazing.	1
On a beautiful Seattle day in May, I decided to check this place out because it made sense to have chowder in Seattle. I'm so glad that I came here!	1
I used to come here a lot, and though the food is good, they screw up the order about fifty percent of the time. I pay for things I don't get and I'm so tired of it. So from now on all of my business will go elsewhere. Putting things in a bag shouldn't be this hard.	0
#60 is for Far Bar. I love this place. Came here with my BF to celebrate his friends birthday. We all had a great time. The food, service and beer selection are amazing. Great spot in Little Tokyo. Will def be back.	1
This place used to be a guilty pleasure of mine because it's not exactly the healthiest, but oh so addicting and good. Well, I can't say that it's so yummy anymore after going with my friend the other week. We went during dinner time on a rainy day when it wasn't that crowded yet. In my history of coming here, the service hasn't ever been really good. You have to constantly ask the servers for things or remind them to bring what you had just asked for. Anyways, on to the food... so before when I used to come I would share a large order of the chicken wings with the original garlic sauce. A lot of times we would come when we were starving so we would split the 50 or 100 piece order. But now they don't have those large order options on the menu anymore. Also, they would usually throw in extra pieces for the larger orders because I don't think they would count that accurately. Now there is just the exact amount. My friend and I split a 20 piece order, and there were exactly 20 pieces. My friend had the Kyochon in Korea and was craving it, but she was a little disappointed that the taste, although decent, was not as good as the original in Korea. This time around, the pieces didn't have the same crispness that they used to. The other thing that I was disappointed about was that the order doesn't come with salad anymore. I actually liked their eccentric salad with fruit pieces, like strawberries, and their version of ranch. It was good to have salad to offset the sodium-filled artery clogging chicken. But no more, the salad is extra. The end of the meal somewhat redeemed itself with the arrival of the green tea yogurt in the little plastic serving dish. Like the rest of korean yogurt places, this was good yogurt, but it still didn't make up for all the other shortcomings. I'm leaving for Korea this week, so I'll have to report back about the real Kyochon there.	0
Amazing new bar with amazing bartenders and amazing management. A very welcomed new addition to the neighborhood.	1
Only local chinesse in this place, so I figured it would be good. It was. Pork in a light flavorful chicken broth for $3. Green onions and another slightly bitter veggie I could not ID. Excellent.	1
Called to see if they were open on Easter Day and the girl on the phone tells me in a condescending tone &#34;normal hours we close at...&#34; I hung up the phone . Stupid! I don&#39;t want to hear about your normal hours or whatever. I want to know what time you close today on Easter Sunday. Is that normal? Ah hahahah	0
The service was outstanding...... the main course was ok but the desert was great	0
It&#39;s never a good sign when you leave a restaurant hungry after spending $60+ for two people. Maybe you&#39;re supposed to spend more money on more food? For that much money, we could have gone to other places in Greenpoint and stuffed ourselves silly with equally good food.<br><br>Ordered the chicken dish and got 4 pieces of chicken in the bowl. Think what would happen if you cut up a chicken finger into four pieces. That&#39;s how small of a portion of chicken you get. Also had the rice with yogurt, hen of the woods and toasted nuts. <br><br>Food was good, overall, but definitely not worth the price for the tiny amount of food you are served.	0
Wanted to love this place based on reviews but this place nor food comes near a five star. <br><br>Firstly, waiting one hour in line to place an order is unacceptable. Secondly, to get attitude from the meat cutter for asking a question n cashier to direct his frustration because he does not have change is even more unacceptable after such a long wait. <br><br>Guy running around w his daughter, who seemed to be the owner/manager? was quite sympathetic n nice as he apologized for credit card machine being down n later gave us siracha wings. Btw, line was molasses slow before machine went down. <br><br>Now down to the food...<br><br>Let us just say that if it were not for the bbq sauce bottles on each table, the meat does not taste like bbq at all. Between all of us, we ordered brisket, pulled pork, spare rib, mac n cheese, cole slaw and corn bread. <br><br>Our rating:<br><br>Brisket 3 stars, pink so undercooked and not flavorful...no seasoning taste at all.<br><br>Pulled pork 2 stars, no bbq taste, alot of fat n skin slab taste. Huge dissapointment.<br><br>Spare rib 1 star, barely cooked raw n pink n no flavor n dry.<br><br>Mac n cheese 1 star as cheese n pasta tasted like two entities while it should have fused together, also cheese not melted enough. <br><br>Cole slaw 1 star, very basic. <br><br>Corn bread 5 Stars hence why place should be called hometown cornbread and not bbq.<br><br>Girl serving sides, owner and male waiter this past saturday were all very nice, all others blah. Place is nicely designed but food and service does not represent the high money cost.<br><br>Do not fret though as you will not be dissapointed nor wait a ridiculous time at Butcher Bar in Astoria. You will close your eyes when you bite into their bbq meat especially the pulled pork.	0
Over one hour for the main plate to arrive AFTER the appetizers and only about 1/2 of the place was full. The food was between mediocre (the pasta overcooked, the rice was mashed) and bad (the chicken was horrible, the nikkei cebiche was sweet, not cebiche-like). The waiters are nice, but inefficient, not once did they refresh our water or even ask how the meal was. For $50/person (no drinks) I would expect much more.	0
There is something so simple and clean tasting about thee hickory burger. I&#39;ve been coming here for years. This is my favorite hamburger spot in LA.its not all flashy like all the burger joints popping up every where. It&#39;s just a simple burger done right every time.	1
I wanted to like this place. I wanted to really like this place. Especially with all the mediocre reviews.But, I don't.It's a waste of time and money. The fresh shrimp rolls were..too chewy.The pork meatballs were...too small. The duck was...dry and tasted waaaaaaaaay too bacon-y. It was gross. We sent it back.The good? The $16 wine, the tofu dish, and the green beans. Yum, but still not worth the price...sad day. And just 1 block from me :(	0
We got crab cakes to start off. I wouldn&#39;t recommend these. They reminded me of something fried you might get at a fast food restaurants. However, the steak frites made up for everything. It was cooked exactly how I like it, and it tasted really great. <br><br>The waiter was friendly and on hand when we needed. The manager was also very nice.	1
I was so excited to try this place! It looks popular from the crowds outside, and read some good review on Yelp. I brought my WHOLE family here tonight for dinner.My mom walks with a cane, and was asked by the hostess if she could get down the stairs. We all replied, "yes, she can". She asked more than 3 more times, and by this time my mom was already halfway down the stairs. I'm not sure what about "yes" was not understood.After we were seated, the nicely dressed wait staff came to take our order, at which time I spotted an approximately 2.5" roach crawling above us on the ceiling. I pointed it out to the waiter, and he motioned for someone to come over. That person scooped it up with a napkin, and it fell on the floor. Not sure what they did with it from then. Not the most appetizing first impression.We ordered the salt/pepper fried Crab. It was "ok". Not worth $40. We also had scallops, "special beef" and honey walnut prawns. Nothing struck as spectacular.The main dining room is in the basement. Probably not the best situation for a restaurant in Chinatown.I think one visit is enough for me. It was an adventure, though.	0
This is a fabulous new Greek restaurant. The soup was the best chicken rice in Las Vegas. Also the best saganaki I&#39;ve had in this town. The mousaka salad and then baklava all excellent. A definite must if you ever thought you like Greek food.	1
Come for drinks & view NOT overpriced food. This is a really cool spot, lots to look at from the creepy wall art to the outdoor patio with a Bombass view of Pershing Square. Not to mention the treck through 2 elevators to get up to the restaurant/bar area.Drinks a bit on the pricier side. ~$12 for a mixed cocktail.	1
Our family had a great get-together at Benihana.  The food was fabulous, and the experience was entertaining.	1
Just another rave review here. There is no parking, but the burgers still make it five stars from me. <br><br>And, the seating is just stools at a counter, very close together. Usually with a wait. <br><br>Takes me back to the 40s and 50s. <br><br>My favorite is the hickory burger, with the sauce on the side.	1
I really enjoyed our dining experience here. We went for a sunday early dinner(~5pm), so we got to be sitted right away.	1
This is sad... I saw sign of food violation sticker on door. It was close.	0
This is a neighborhood spot. Everyone is welcome and you definitely feel that way when walk in. The staff are friendly and they love food. Michael&#39;s beard and enthusiasm for good eats makes it hard to leave after eating any meal there. Try everything on he menu, it&#39;s worth it and you won&#39;t be sorry!	1
the food was really good! tasted fresh and flavorful. me and my boyfriend tried some new dishes and enjoyed our meal. they had many vegetarian options for me and a lot of meat choices for my boyfriend. we only paid $26 for 1 appetizer, 2 entrees, and a dessert!! really good prices and big menu. server was very nice and helpful. she asked a few times if we had any questions about the food (as some of the words were Bulgarian) and she explained the dishes well. definitely will be back and will be bringing friends.	1
I&#39;ve been here 2x so far and like it a lot. They are relatively new so I hope they maintain their good quality food and service. Food was good. I&#39;ve only tried their pasta marinara with chicken and it&#39;s good.	1
The staff is extremely friendly. A friend dragged me here because he wanted to grab some smoothie at 5 am... I didn't order anything, but the staff saw that I was waiting for my friends drink and kindly gave me a bakery treat just for waiting. far drive, but it's totally worth it if you're craving treats, drinks, or a sandwich. The bakery I must say, is extremely sweet to the point you will have a higher chance of getting a cavity. But it is good, however, it's to sweet for my taste buds.	1
I eat here from time to time, and I keep coming back for 1 reason alone... Consistency!<br>Every single time I have been to Siam Bistro the food is good. I&#39;ve had a bunch of different things on the menu, and never a bad one.<br>If you are in the area, it&#39;s worth checking out.	1
Found this place on yelp, I have never reviewed a place before and had to sign up for an account to review. I had the Honduran Carne Assada, it was prefect, the plantain was ripe, sweet and perfectly prepared. This is like getting real central American street food than fancy but perfect. We had guacamole that was obviously prepared after we ordered it, very fresh. My friend had a burrito that was delicious.	0
Seriously, giving this place four stars is like giving McDonald&#39;s four stars... Sure I was born in Pittsburgh but living in Miami, there are way better places to get Cuban food. Even Cuban food fast! As they like to advertise. They don&#39;t have limes! What kind of cuban sandwich couldn&#39;t use a nice squeeze of lime? That&#39;s like going for sushi and the restaurant not having soy sauce. If you&#39;re the kind of person that thinks Burger King or McDonald&#39;s sells awesome hamburgers, than you&#39;re going like this place. It&#39;s exceedingly generic and unoriginal. However, if you&#39;re longing for something more authentic, keep moving... I&#39;ve had better Cuban sandwiches from the mom-and-pop Columbian places in Kendall, which is just sad for a bunch of &#34;Cuban guys&#34;	0
SO DISAPPOINTED. we showed up for dinner last night and because of broken water pipes were unable to be seated. the restaurant said they would give us a call if things opened. No phone call. No follow up. Just a canceled reservation. We called dell&#39;anima (sister restaurant) who could not accomodate us either due to the spillover effect from L&#39;artusi. The restaurant did not make any attempt to truly apologize or offer us future reservations (or a glass of wine at the bar!!!!). Truly sad to say that though i have heard great things, my experience with this family of restaurants was VERY POOR.	0
Weak crust. Doesn't anyone in Seattle make baguette with a decent crust? Macrina certainly doesn't.	0
Cant get any better than this. I stopped by before work and let me tell you, best dogs I&#39;ve ever tasted. Can also serve as a GREAT hangover killer ;) Much recommended!	1
My prime rib and baked potato was luke warm.  My wife's steak was  over cooked.  She ordered med rare and was given med well.  Finally, both of our veggies were very salty.	1
Beautiful restaurant with a very large, but intimate outdoor dining area surrounded by trees. You can&#39;t even see or hear Sunset Blvd! The Brussel sprouts were the best I have ever had. They were crispy and were topped with balsamic vinegar and sliced almonds. I tried the flat iron steak which consisted of two huge/thick cuts of steak. It was very tender and flavorful. I tried a little of the pork, that too was very good, but I prefer the steak.	1
Damn i really wanted to like this place too...The first time i drove by and saw the old 'Pasquale' sign on the corner of 9th and Irving, i instantly had a one of those "This has to be some authentic Italian pizza" feelings. I vowed i would love this place no matter what it tasted like.So filled with high expectations, i tried it. Hmph.The sauce is pretty good, the pepperonis are sliced pretty thin, the crust ends up a little hard-- it ain't that bad of a pie, but at the same time it really isn't all that special. The staff here seems pretty friendly, and the menu looks pretty big. I'm sure I'll come back here again to try another pizza, or maybe some veal-- but for right now it's just A-OK	0
Very enjoyable evening with my wife. Food was exceptional and reasonably priced given the quality proper preparation and attentive service.	1
I love the Greenbird with shelton farms turkey, crushed avocado, green cheese, butter lettuce, sprouts, and a green goddess sauce.The hard cider was strong, but great with any burger and side of truffle cheese fries.	1
Outstanding food. Loved the biscuit very much. Best I&#39;ve had in 11211 since GOODS shut down. The buttermilk dressing is exactly like my grandmother used to make. Delightful. Can&#39;t wait to go again.	1
not impressed -- everything was a notch below average.	0
Mediocre mexican food, with sub mediocre service.<br><br>This was pretty straightforward: we were ordering our drinks and an appetizer. You go away, then you come back and take our entree order. You don&#39;t disappear for half an hour. I had damn near finished my beer before I even got to order my dinner. No refills while we waited, either. That waiter was one disappearing act.<br><br>We&#39;d come in hoping for a quick meal. No such luck.	0
Good but not worth the price.	1
I really enjoy coming to this restaurant for more than one reason. One, the food... having been there several times, I have tried the short ribs which are excellent, sea bass which is absolutely delicious, lobster mac and cheese, the tuna, the popcorn shrimp (I have no idea how anyone can talk bad about it) and the salad with the quinoa which I am obsessed with. The desserts I've tried are the churros, cotton candy and the "flower pots" which is a banana crumble and a chocolate crumble. Honestly I cannot say anything bad about any of it and would recommend them all depending on what one is in the mood for.Second, presentation... All appetizers, meals and desserts are presented in a very fun and interesting way and definitely not something you will find elsewhere. Other tables are always looking at the tables next to them to see what their presentation is. Third, service... Immaculate! Everyone is so pleasant and attentive and really provide excellent service. The manager is amazing and so pleasant and personable with the patrons. Makes you feel at home and wanting to come back.The place is loud since there's music playing and it's usually crowded but it has never interfered with conversations. I definitely recommend this place for the reasons stated and also because overall it's fun and trendy restaurant.	1
Awesome new spot in bayridge. Outdoor patio is great, might need some more heaters as the weather gets cooler. Beer selection is on point. Food options seemed good, waffle fries were amazing! <br>Definitely will continue to check this place out and hope the beer selection changes often!	1
Their food is good but way too oily. I want my vegan food to be on the healthier side and this is anything but. Yes, they have good stuff but there&#39;s definitely better vegan in NYC. If they cut back on the oil it would be significantly better but I personally don&#39;t enjoy ordering a seitan sandwich and having to use 10 napkins to pat it down.	0
It does not even deserve one star! Over priced drinks, rude bar tenders, ordered a dirty martini was mostly olive juice. Don't waste your time with this place!	0
Well worth the price, the chicken in my ramen was very juicy. Tasted a lot like toto ramen but didn&#39;t have the one hour wait.	1
Was absolutely over the moon when this place arrived in my neighborhood. Happy hour selections are outstanding, the dinners are perfectly portioned and the ambiance at night is super sexy.	0
Get the curry bowl with brown rice and thank me later.	1
Tripas tacos were too salty. Asked for pineapple on tacos and they still forgot. I&#39;ve been here before and I was impressed. But not this time. They really need to set up a better strategy for ordering the food. I would recommend that you order and pay in the cashier and wait for your order to get called. Simple right?	0
Holy moly. GET THE BACON WRAPPED DATES !!!Lamb and black cod also very good here. Will definitely be going back! Recommend reservations at least 1 hour ahead on weekends, to save waiting !	1
I&#39;m very disappointed that they forgot AGAIN my ingredients. No vinegar, oil, peppers, onions. This is the 2nd time it&#39;s happened and it&#39;s been both places on Sahara. This was my favorite sandwich shop but it&#39;s looking like not anymore.	0
Came all the way to brooklyn to try out this restaurant that was featured by anthony bourdain and eddie huang. We tried many dishes and i can say they were all pretty disappointing. Portions were so small for the price. Papaya salad was subpar. I would say the pork belly dish was good but menu listed it came with pork shoulder. No pork shoulder in dish... Desserts were extremely disappointing, especially the pumpkin tapioca cake with sticky rice. Why was the sticky rice soooo salty?? And the pumpkin tapioca was so unbelievably hard. I expected it to be smooth and soft. Quite disappointed. Extra star for the nice ambience.	0
It&#39;s not really good. It&#39;s more of a tradition.	0
So many great sauces for the flavorful chicken strips dont leave without the smoked tomato soup!!	1
Came here on a Friday night and the atmosphere is definitely cool and unique. Started out w a bunch of craft cocktails that were all simple but very well put together. The crab cake is the best appetizer our group ordered but the fried shrimp were huuuge. Now on to my favorite part of the night: the fried chicken. It was juicer, crispier and seasoned better than any fried chicken I&#39;ve had in this city. I&#39;ll definitely be coming back.	1
Not the best but far from the worst. I&#39;d rather eat at Nate &amp; Al&#39;s in Beverly Hills, or brave a trip to Langer&#39;s, but Canter&#39;s is open 24-7, which is handy at 4am when you&#39;re anywhere near the Fairfax district and feel like a corned beef sandwich on rye with dressing and coleslaw.<br><br>I&#39;ve only had a fraction of what&#39;s on the huge menu; it&#39;s sensory overload, but I have a feeling that only a fraction of what&#39;s on the menu is really, really good: chicken soup, towering sandwiches, the lox plate, Jewish deli things like that, but when east of La Brea, Canter&#39;s is definitely one of my go-to places.<br><br>Is it Kosher? I don&#39;t know. I&#39;ve seen Orthodox Jews intheir black suits all over these parts, but never inside Canter&#39;s.<br><br>That said, the sandwiches here are big (and on the expensive side). The menu might say &#34;hot&#34; corned beef or pastrami, but the meat comes sandwiched to you sort of warmish. It might bother you, if you&#39;re that type but there&#39;s enough for two or three normal sandwichs in one Canter&#39;s Brooklyn Avenue. Also, at times, the crust on the rye can be a little unforgiving to tender mouths, so take some care.<br><br>The chicken broth is pretty good, I guess. It&#39;s better than Campbell&#39;s and tastes like the perfect remedy for a cold. I also like the heartier soups, particularly the barley bean soup, and the split pea (if I&#39;m ever there on a Wednesday). The huge bowls come with some bagel chips, some of them sturdy enough to break a crown, but not totally impervious to soup. <br>There are also half sandwich/soup cup combos that are very nice and won&#39;t put you under a food coma.<br><br>There are entrees on the back of the menu that come either ala carte, or as a full meal with bread and butter, a starter like their big bowls of soup, and a simple dessert. I&#39;ve only had their brisket, but that&#39;s because of my weakness for potato pancakes. <br><br>I&#39;ve had the corned beef and cabbage. Not bad, but don&#39;t be surprised if there&#39;s half a head of boiled cabbage underneath that seemingly huge pile of deli sliced corned beef. <br><br>I&#39;ve also had their big serving of short ribs, suitable for sharing, which are on the bland side, but tender as ever.<br><br>Once, a tablemate ordered a salad that looked like it was supposed to feed a family.<br><br>There&#39;s a huge deli case in front and also a bakery section, of which I&#39;ve never been a huge fan.<br><br>Toilets for the main dining room are upstairs, making it sort of a trek after a big meal, but it&#39;s almost the same effort to walk to the back dining room, adjacent to the noisy lounge area, for the first floor restroom.<br><br>Their parking lot is nearby, at the Fairfax/Oakwood intersection, and it validates. There&#39;s also another smaller lot across that can handle a bit of overflow, but with both lots full, you might have a better chance winning the lottery that finding street parking. <br><br>FYI, more often than not, a homeless person stationed between the bright restaurant entrance and your parked ride gets you coming and going.<br><br>The service can be salty, depending on who&#39;s assigned to your section, but I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s intolerable; this place, transplanted from Boyle Heights a faint lifetime ago, is an L.A. landmark. It&#39;s nice to go just to say you&#39;ve been there.	1
Great neighborhood serving restaurant. Valet available right in front. Me and sister had the special for the night: a tomato based squid ink pasta with seafood. deelish! And not fishy tasting at all. Split the arugula salad and the baked polenta to start. Overall a great experience. Didn't have a reservation and they seated us relatively right away even though it was a Friday night. Will definitely be back!	1
This is another one of those places that has stayed constant in my life since I first set my foot in LA. And another place where I used to go for hangover, and now I go to cure my morning sickness instead. They are always in the same place, always open whenever I go, and always have the same food that I can predict. The abalone porridge and the samgyetang are still good, but another soup that helps me now is the seaweed soup. (loved it so much that now I am considering coming here for my birthday soup on my birthday.. yeah only a Korean would understand what the heck I am talking about.) And of course, their jangjorim is still as warm and yummy as they can be (and as my hubby put it, free beef side dish as much as you want it)<br>Please, never go away. I love you guys.	1
The food is good, the place is cool looking, the vibe of service is off tho. It should be like a diner vibe, like Johnny Rockets or something. The girls are quiet. I like the food tho, just think it has potential to be a neighborhood spot.	1
Great food and ambience! Finaly! A restaurant that the music was not a live concert at the arena. Music was actualy nice....food took a little time, but was still good. I recommend!	1
This place is the bomb real cool and nice inside. The staff and the 3 owners are really friendly and down to earth. And the veggies are nice and fresh awesome salads. I came here twice and had awesome customer experience. Oh! And get some coconut water with your salad taste soon good!	1
This place is perfect! Let&#39;s just say if they had one around where I live I would be there every day! Little place with amazing taste and ambiance. <br><br>I had the chicken chaufa (if that&#39;s how you spell it) with quinoa. They had two sizes, regular and large. Now, I&#39;m someone who can eat a lot but today I thought I should take it easy and get the smaller one so I got the regular. I&#39;m sitting in my car writing this review and I am full! The regular size was perfect!<br><br>All in all, this place is amazing and I wish they had one in broward! Also, claim the two free cookies cause they are on point!	1
saw a cockroach and the manager just sad sorry and still brought a bill for 70$	0
Come on there over 400 reviews. no one cares what i have to say.	1
The only fast food chain I eat at. Just ask servers to put on new gloves and you are set for a gluten free meal. Check the Taco Del Mar website for which items are gluten-free before you go. Staff is wonderful too!	1
Awesome food!	1
I have been coming to this red robins location since they opened their doors. While I&#39;ve always liked there burgers and ice cold beers lately the service had gone down hill. The last 3 times I have visited this place the food takes about 45 minutes to arrive. The refills never seem to show up and forget about getting an types of sauces upon your request. I can understand if your short handed or what ever the case be. Over the last 3 visits over the last 6 months it&#39;s gotten worse. They had no utensils or glass cups. They gave us plastic forks/knives and cardboard cups. Needless to say I will never be coming back to this red robins and since this seems to be the only one in Miami red robins period.	0
Good and service was subpar - cool atmosphere but don&#39;t come here to eat or drink they can&#39;t even make a proper martini and it took asking 4 people to get my jacket hung up it also took a hour to get the check -honestly we won&#39;t be going back and def stay away from the fried Mac and cheese balls they were flavorless	0
My husband and I usually go to DaNicos, but decided to try this restaurant because it had a higher rating on Yelp. Big mistake, service is nice, but the food is twice as expensive and incredibly bland. If you want good italian, head to DaNicos!	0
Yes the strawberry fields are good, BUT the service and friendliness of staff is horrible.	0
Went here last night for the 2nd time and loved it even more than the 1st!	1
if i'm in little tokyo, i'm hitting up far bar. everytime i've been, it's been perfect-- not overly crowded, attentive staff, good music, and non-pretentious clientele. there's something fantastic about going somewhere so hidden & mysterious!	1
i had heard good things, but can't echo them myself.the chef's tasting menu was primarily a spread of the appetizers. for a chef's tasting menu, i'd expect maybe half the courses to come directly from the menu. a couple were good, the rest average, none were bad. the drinks were a wash, i enjoyed mine, my date did not enjoy hers.we had no less than 4 different servers, which made for an incoherent experience with each asking the same questions. that doesn't count the clearing staff.the final server forgot to add the meals to the bill and then apologized when i pointed it out. it's a nit, but i'd expect a &quot;thank you&quot; instead of &quot;i'm sorry&quot; when i'm correcting an error in the restaurant's favor and about to fork over an additional $150.	0
My girlfriend and I checked out Mohawk Bend last night. Talk about a shit show. It was pretty busy, but there is no excuse for the unorganized and inconsistent staff. FIrst of all the hostess wouldn&#39;t take us on the wait list because the wait list had lots of people on it. WTF? I walked around and there was 3 open tables. So, we went to the bar and had to wait 30 min for a beer. The bartenders we slow and didn&#39;t have knowledge of where anything was. They needed a bar back to help. Three bartenders and 10 people in the kitchen bumping into each other.<br>Then we found a seat in the bar and the waitress said we couldn&#39;t order food in that area. Huh? Where is the defining line that says this area is food only and this area is drinks only, I asked. The waitress just walked away. Nice service..So, then the manager comes by and says that we can order food anywhere we want. Once we get our pizza and hour later, we were freezing with the AC cranked on our table. So, we moved to the bar that had since emptied out to finish our food. Oh, the pizza was great, but the roasted artichoke was small and very dry for $9. At the bar, a waitress came by and said that we can&#39;t eat food at the bar... Once again, what are we supposed to do here??? Eat at the bar, not eat at the bar, stand up, walk in circles? you tell me. The management really needs to hire staff that can do their job and handle a busy night. I&#39;d love to give this place another chance, but most likely will go somewhere else since they aren&#39;t able to serve customers properly.	0
I've been here twice and have been completely satisfied both times. I've never had to worry about finding parking or waiting for a table because I would take Metro to the Hollywood/Vine station right after work. The restaurant is located within Space15Twenty next to Urban Outfitters and Hennessy & Ingalls. Service is friendly and helpful (mostly young dudes), and the atmosphere is casual and comfortable with optional outside seating. $10 for a burger is ridiculous, you say? Taste it and get back to me.I've had the Umami Burger and Port/Stilton Burger. Both very delicious!!! The meat (juicy! yummy!) is cooked medium rare unless otherwise asked. People complain about the burgers being too small. If it's quantity you're looking for, go get a Big Mac at McDonald's. If you order fries, they come with a variety of yummy condiments. I think I prefer Umami Burger over Father's Office based on taste AND environment (who do I have to bitch slap to order my food and get a table???). Can't wait to try the other burgers!!!	1
had the shrimp pad thai. it was pretty tasteless and had dried shrimp in it. gross.	0
Incredible food, open 24 hours, AWESOME staff!! What more could you ask for?! I had left my cell phone at one of the tables there at 3am after a night out, only to realize my phone is not with me in the parking lot. When we went back, the staff had kept the phone safe and sound! MANY THANKS to OLIVIA and BELLA and the rest of the staff for being so awesome. YOU ALL ARE AMAZING -- THANK YOU!!!! :D	1
This place in my opinion makes one of the top 3 burgers in Madison. Cooked over a flame the Bacon Bourbon Burger with some sort of aoli on it is money. However I have been moderately happy or disappointed every time I have ate the ribs (were smoked days prior), brisket or pulled pork. If you stick to the burgers this place is awesome!	0
Country Walk needed a fast food place like this one. You guys have to try the &#34;Maicitos&#34; is by far the best corn based meal you&#39;ll ever try.	1
We have been going to Mountain branch through all of the owner ships, and the food has been consistent and a nice place to have to have  lunch or dinner. However they have made some negative changes that I think are going to hurt this place tremendously.   When you now order a meal say a steak, for $28.00, that is what you get a steak and a glass of water, no starch or vegetable. This place has lost it's value big time, over trying to make a profit. It is a shame, as long as they keep this policy we will no longer support this restaurant.	0
I&#39;m not sure why it&#39;s labeled &#39;$&#39;. The prices are the same as everywhere else and the portions are smaller. They also arbitrarily tax you - which is odd for a cash-only place.<br><br>The food is ridiculously spicy. I even asked for less spice - it was on the receipt - and what i got was dark red and burned!!! <br><br>It&#39;s sad because the noodles/meat are delicious - you can taste the difference (if you order something without any spice at all). <br><br>If you have a cold though, get a soup mildly hot - it will clear out your sinuses in no time!	0
I love this place!! All it took was for my in-laws to take me and my wife on a first experience and my and I loved it!  Since then, we've been going back for more!!  We have no complaints. The food is amazing and the staff are phenomenal!  I would recommend this to anyone!  Since coming out of the hotel industry on strip, the Charcoal Room is well comparable to high end steak houses that are known for big names!  Thank you for an excellent experience!!  Open Table as well for making this genius app!	1
My wife and I love this place. We eat there at least once a month and every time is better than before. Garlic budies figlets grilled artichoke and kobe burger are our favorites	1
Come early on the weekend! Great breakfast food and great staff. Got the favorite and eggs florentine, really tasty and fresh. Portions were large and came with a cute little muffin.	1
just went in for drinks and watched amazing looking food pass me by... unfortunately the few drinks i tried were not so great. the worst by far was this mango cocktail (to be avoided!)	0
My boyfriend and I went here for Valentine&#39;s Day. We had a five course pre-set dinner menu (but 3 out of the 5 courses had options to choose from).<br><br>Between the two of us we got the lentil soup, bruschetta, hummus and pita, baba ganoush, sea bass and lamp chops, followed by rice pudding and some kind of chocolate mousse (amazing) dessert with crunchy baklava-like pieces in it. The entire meal was super tasty and artfully crafted. Even the zuccinis on our sea bass plate were cut into hearts. Nice touch!<br><br>Also, the lamb chops I had here were the best I&#39;ve had in life. Period.<br><br>The only reason I gave this place 4 stars is the service was a little off. It took a long time to get the first course. I asked for tea and the waitress forgot. We also asked for more pita to go with the hummus (ratio was off) and that took forever too. <br><br>All around great meal, but service could be more on point.	1
Celebrated my 40th birthday at your restaurant. Food was excellent,service was less then mediocre. Very disappointed with the service. Thank goodness the food was so great. I would recommend to a friend based off the food.	1
I guess mark neighborhood casserole shop as one of those things you didn&#39;t know you needed till you got one. Fresh, delicious, friendly, inventive, and just all around with it. <br><br>Had the biscuits and gravy then took home a kielbasa casserole and both were as close to home cooking as I&#39;ve found yet in this city. <br><br>I&#39;ll give this place 10 glasses of water. Cannot recommend it enough.	1
Taj Palace has been our go-to Indian restaurant for the past year for these reasons 	1
Used Eat First Boston web page to enjoy a Sunday Lunch.  The &quot;Fact was a Noisy Jazz Brunch.  Food was tasty and creative.  Service was excellent and attentive.	1
Everytime I land in MIA I head straight to Calle Ocho for Pedro Bello&#39;s cigars and a frita and batido de mamey from El Rey!!<br><br>Que rrrricura! Delicious! ..and best of all.. a fast, cheap bite to eat!<br><br>Truly El Rey!!	1
LOVE the new location in Capital HIll - that's our hood! :) My dear hunny and I did a date night here a couple months ago and we were quite impressed. Reminds me, we must go back (I think their menu changes up regularly):	0
Decor: A-Cuisine: C-Service: D+Working in hospitality, I'm tough on restaurants and hotels I visit. I have expectations and they need to be met or exceeded for my money.I grew up in Highland Park and have been wanting to try Maximiliano for quite some time. It's always seems buzzing with activity and even has valet (really?!)DECOR-I finally took my friend for dinner tonight. Surprisingly small and nosey (similar to Bottega Louie) but had a smart approach to it's decor. The restroom feels and smells like the ones at Union Station :-/CUISINE- The Chicken Ravioli wasn't worth keeping at the table, it was bland. The Pot Roasted Chicken was juicy but the garlic spinach was bland and the potatoes were cold. The veal risotto was nothing to rave about. BUT the Cheesecake du Jour was delicious (it's made in-house but I forgot what it had since the server talked so fast) SERVICE-We got Hector as our server: motor mouth server (he talked so fast we only understood half of what he said), nonchalant (when asked what he recommended, his reply was "everything's good but depends what you like" with no emotion), attitude and no sympathy when my friend sent back the Chicken Ravioli (he asked, "what's wrong with it?" with no apology) AND got charged for someone else's bill (WTH?!)Great potential but fails to deliver once you're there. I wouldn't go out of my way to Maximiliano for dinner. I'd rather deal with the noise at Bottega Louie. But I would go back for the Cheesecake :-)	0
This place is a tiny little hole in the wall that I can see really taking off. <br>When you enter, it instantly has a Mediterranean vibe there&#39;s a bar area to the side and a main dining area. The dining area is actually very spacious and wide open. The table layout though can make the meals feel quite intimate<br>The staff here is extremely nice and helpful. We were greeted with a giant smile and a welcome. My and my friend weren&#39;t too well versed on the food and the host was sure to explain exactly what came in each dish<br>The food was amazing. The skewers were melt in your mouth good and the lemon butter vegetables made me a convert. It comes with beef, chicken or steak. The sandwich was good, it had pork and other goodies slathered with sauce in a bun. I haven&#39;t sampled the pasta yet but my friend raves about how good it was. For dessert, there was mascarpone, which isn&#39;t a dessert I normally like but since the host recommended I decided to go with and let&#39;s just say I wasn&#39;t disappointed <br>--a few points notes, they don&#39;t have their liquor license as of 2/16/14<br>-- related to above, the bar area is really deserted <br>They also have a stage and what looks to be a setup for live music. Whenever this does start being used, I can see it being a huge hit. <br>Overall it a good restaurant, some things that I see them workin on and no reason why this wouldn&#39;t be 5 stars all the way!!	1
Blackened grilled salmon, calamari fritti and burrata with prosciutto were out of this world. The focaccia was also very yummy. I spied some arancini that looked amazing, definitely going to try that my next time here. Nice ambiance, attentive staff and relaxing atmosphere.	1
My wife had salmon that was terrible.  She didn't eat and the waiter did nothing about.	0
Try the new Ghost Burger if you even wonder to this hidden gem in the SCI-arc building. The ghost pepper aioli is a perfect touch to the already tasty burger. Chris and Paris are two of the friendliest guys serving food. These twin brothers are your taste buds. Everything and anything they make is bomb. If you don&#39;t like the food they make you don&#39;t like food.	1
Had a fantastic time - the brunch is simple and presented marvelously. the desserts are perfectly made and delicious. The staff is very attentive and the bartenders are so much fun. Jay is a very knowledgeable manager and host. going back for dinner!	1
My dining experience at Bea tonight was absolutely dreadful. The service here was by and large the worst I have ever encountered in a restaurant and in spite of the all the great reviews, the staff, in particular our waitress, should remember that the customer is always right. Without a doubt there are times that this is not the case, but in tonight, it most definitely was, and she needed to have some integrity and take the fall for her mistake. The only logical reason why we could have been seated at 7:50, placed our orders at 8:10 and been served one hour later at 9:10 is if our waitress failed to give our orders to the kitchen in a timely fashion. The computer apparently showed that our orders hadn&#39;t been put in until 8:30, which leaves an unaccounted for 20 minutes between when we gave our orders to our waitress and the kitchen receiving it. This gap went unexplained by the restaurant manager, our waitress and the &#34;event coordinator.&#34; There were three surrounding tables that had no guests before us, all of whom received their main courses before us, and one of which left before we even got ours. That is simply unacceptable, and particularly so without some sort of explanation from the restaurant staff. Neither a round of the shots on the house that tables with good service also received nor a measly 10% compensation on the check made up for the horrific service that my table received this evening. We will not be returning, and our waitress should get a grip on what&#39;s more important: happy customers who want to come back to Bea, or saving face on a sloppy, but human mistake.	0
Mehhhhhh.. I really liked our waiter, but the food was not very impressive	0
YUMMY avocado salad.	1
This is a good start for DTLA&#39;s upcoming scene.<br>The St. Cloud cocktail is amazing. Actually tried to remake it at home. <br>Food is expensive, I&#39;d advise to go eat somewhere else first for dinner, then come here for some drinks and late night apps. The scene is amazing at night. Live music, comfy seating, and your surrounded by lit up high rises. Felt so shi shi.	1
Pros:<br>Chocolate pudding cake<br>Key lime pie<br>Mac and cheese<br><br>Cons:<br>Waited 45 minutes on line to hear that they were SOLD OUT of beef ribs, beans, collard greens and root beer. Couldn&#39;t you put up a sign and inform your customers??? Nope. You just had us all wait till we got to the front of the line to let us know. No bueno! <br>Brisket was mediocre. Needed some salt. <br>Spare ribs were so dry I couldn&#39;t cut it with a knife nor my teeth. <br>Potato salad was okay.<br><br>There was nothing outstanding. You don&#39;t have to waste a trip down to Red Hook to wait at least 45 minutes on line for mediocre food.	0
Even though we had eaten breakfast a scant 45 minutes before coming here, we still endeavored to get the full experience and ended up ordering the #1 (Grilled Pork) and the #2 (Caribbean) sandwiches. I was expecting a gustatory revelation but instead what I got was a very tasty, very messy sandwich which I am 95% sure that I could recreate to a 95% authenticity level... do the math on that one.	0
Love love love this place. My boyfriend and I tried it for the first time tonite and loved it. We sat at the bar, and the actual sushi chefs were very nice and accommodating, very patient if you had questions about some of the fish as well. I had some tuna and yellowtail and we ordered a few rolls as well, and everything was fresh and melted in our mouths.The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the servers weren't very attentive to us after we sat down. Luckily, we were near one of the chefs who kept an eye on us, and if we needed anything, he made sure we got it right away. There was even a mix up with one of the orders of our dessert (ice cream) and he caught it and made sure it was fixed! For sure coming back to this place :) Totally reminded me of my Grandmothers Japanese Restaurant growing up!	1
I've been going to this place since I was a kid and I give it 1 star for being a historical place and another star for the speedy service. Just check out the speed of the guy on the grill!With that being said, this is a HORRIBLE option for VEGETARIANS! If you don't enjoy enormous pancakes whilst everyone else is eating a substantial meal, don't go because this is a steak and eggs, heart attack inducing restaurant. There is really nothing healthy here at all. My cholesterol is soaring just thinking about it!	0
In my OPINION, you shouldn't have to go to another restaurant to feel satiated after you eat a semi-expensive "meal"...I give Flour + Water 2 stars for taste and decor, but -3 stars for the sub-appetizer sized portions.	0
FANTASTIC ambiance<br>GREAT mac n cheese<br>DELICIOUS fried apple tart thing<br>FULL bar, yummy cocktails<br>reserve a booth with curtains if you want intimacy.<br><br>I absolutely adore this place. This had become my new default restaurant.	1
Went there today and the waitress was beyond rude. Another waitress came over and gave us chips and salsa. Our group thought chips and salsa came with the meal, so we started eating then. Our waitress then asked who was going to pay for the chips they gave to us.... We refused to pay that was not our mistake.	0
My girlfriend and I were searching for a nice dining spot to grab a quick bite, and for some time now I&#39;ve had Deli-In bookedmarked in my queue, so we decided to give this small hole-in-wall eatery a try. <br><br>My girlfriend praised this place for it&#39;s large portions, extremely friendly service and good food, and fortunately she was right. <br><br>As soon as you walk-in you&#39;ll notice that this place is quite tiny, however, once you&#39;re greeted by the friendly Korean gentleman manning the cashier you&#39;ll find yourself smiling and pleased with your decision. The menu is quite diverse offering breakfast foods, sandwiches, dinner entrees, and Latin/Mexican food. And for those of you who speak Spanish, the owner&#39;s son speaks fluent Spanish, so feel free to test his Spanish skills...;) haha<br><br>I ordered the club sandwich on wheat and my girlfriend ordered the grilled tilapia plate. The club sandwich was hearty and delicious, and with a side order of fries to round out my meal I was sufficiently filled and satisfied. Unfortunately, my girlfriend was a bit disappointed with her selection, pointing out that the food tasted a tad bland, and after sampling some of her food I had to agree; the fish was slightly overcooked and the rice vegetable mix was lacking flavor. <br><br>Now you may be wondering why I&#39;m giving this place 4 stars instead of 3. Simply put, the service and experience garners the extra star. Don&#39;t get me wrong, Deli-In offers great food for affordable prices, and if you decide to get some of their main specialties you&#39;ll surely won&#39;t be disappointed. However, if you do decide to order something out of the norm then understand that there&#39;s a 50/50 chance it&#39;ll be good or sub-par. The service here is outstanding however, the wait times can be long, but I suggest calling in your order ahead of time.<br><br>Overall Deli-In is an exceptional little diner that deserves the high praise that it has received, and I&#39;ll surely be coming back for more. To great eatings :)	1
Carrabean Roast was the BEST THING EVER. Ate it in it's entirety. Licked up the drippings and forgot about the hour wait for the food.	0
Great service, uptown burger was awesome best burger I&#39;ve had in a while. Good choice of drafts on tap.	1
Beautiful location, nice decor. <br><br>Don&#39;t expect them to respect your reservation time. We had reservations at 9:30pm, didn&#39;t get seated until 10:45pm. The hostess&#39;s response when asked about the reservation time, &#34;Yeah, but you&#39;re gonna have wait.&#34; <br><br>The food was terrible. The only thing worth eating was the croquettes. But I mean really how can you possibly mess up with those? Really not a place for dinner, more of a casual drink pre-party warm up location.<br><br>I won&#39;t be gong back, wouldn&#39;t recommend it either.	0
Overrated historical place that is ok if you like greasy, oily eggs, saturated soggy toast, long to wait, fast served food. Don&#39;t get the omelet...it&#39;s velvetta cheese &amp; eggs. Norms has better breakfasts	0
Good and very tasty	1
My wife and I recently returned from a trip to New Orleans where we experienced some fantastic (authentic) Cajun cuisine. Yearning for some good red beans and rice we picked up a couple of orders to go and took them home anticipating a culinary re-run of our trip. We were sadly disappointed. The food was so over-spiced we could not eat it. The tiny bits of meat did not compare to the huge hunks of sausage normally served in that dish. I spent 45 minutes trying to get through to the restaurant and could not. I eventually spoke with the manager who was supposed to taste the food and get back to me. (Two days later that has yet to happen.) I want a refund. The food is not authentic cajun cuisine by any stretch of the imagination and not worth your time or money.	0
My rating is based on the service as we never got the chance to try the food.Ordered the penne pasta and grilled chicken sandwich. After 30 minutes, we asked one of the servers where our food was. He said he would check.After another 5-8 minutes, someone else came over to our table and let us know they did not have any pasta. They kept "pushing our order" and taking orders for the pasta knowing none was prepared.Why they couldn't just tell us that right away or even 10 minutes into the meal is beyond me. I asked her that question, but was given no answer.At that point, we left. When we were getting our refund (I think it was a manager, but she never identified herself so I don't know for sure), the cashier was very rude and just stared at us, like we did something wrong.I heard they service was bad and they were very slow in getting food to table. I thought it was due to being new... It looks more like poor management. I won't be dining there again.And if you're in a hurry or have limited time, go somewhere else.	0
The food is excellent but maybe because my family and I went on a late Sunday night, the service was quite slow. We waited about 40 min for our first entree to be served. And they serve one dish at a time. If you are planning to order more than 1 dish, add 10 minutes to the aforementioned time. <br><br>Tl;dr= excellent food, slow service	1
It&#39;s amazing I could be this disappointed by a meal I paid less than $3 for. Looking at the 1000+ positive reviews I have to wonder if the had their d-squad in the kitchen today. The dumplings were chewy and tough. The sesame pancake was cold and the duck was pretty flavorless. I was raised to never waste food but I still couldn&#39;t bring myself to finish the food from<br>Prosperity. If you find yourself on Eldridge st and craving dumplings do yourself a favor and walk the extra blocks to Vanessa&#39;s.	0
Opening in a beautiful new space in Hollywood, Oinkster has arrived to fulfill all your burger-fied dreams. With a full wrap-around parking lot and an incredible truffle aioli, the burgers and fries here NEVER disappoint. Hollywood now has Oinksteraide on tap and ready to serve. Slow fast food has never tasted so good! I love you Oinkster!	1
I&#39;ve tried just about everything from this place. Delivery is super fast, food is always hot and tasty. I am hooked! I order directly from them instead of grubhub and I get to save a few bucks.	1
The mussels and lamb chops were incredible!! Also the cocktails are delicious, especially the cucumber corpse revival! Love this place as a Friday night date night with my boyfriend!!	0
Really excellent food, good coffee, plenty of other drinks to choose from, yummy pastries, warm atmosphere.	0
I can&#39;t even begin to tell you how horrible the food was here... The only reason I give bianca 2 stars is because of the dessert. I have to admit the tiramisu &amp; flan was pretty good. <br>Out of all four different pasta dishes we ordered, only the lasagna was acceptable. The black ink pasta special was not even edible (looked like dirt, tasted like salt and water!). Everything else was not memorable. <br>Would not recommend this place unless you are going for dessert. <br>I don&#39;t even know why this place have 4 stars....<br>But definitely recommend it to people you hate. :)	0
For me to even review this taco spot means I&#39;m in love! I ordered the beef quesadilla with everything on it! Maaaaaaaan, it was soooooooo good! Fresh! Juicy! <br>This is going to be a problem! It gave me that boost to do my Chelsea shopping! <br>Took off 1 star for no seating and because the quesadilla is waaaay too small for $4.50.	1
I stopped here because I was in the neighborhood and I love Mediterranean food. The staff was friendly and welcoming, and it was a great dining experience. In addition to Mediterranean food, they offer wood oven pizzas and sandwiches. I&#39;ll definitely be coming back here again!	1
Canter's may be my favorite restaurant in Los Angeles. Sometimes you just have to have matzoh ball soup. Admittedly overpriced, Canter's will be your Jewish mother if you feel a cold coming on. Why is matzoh ball soup univiersally expensive? It's just chicken stock and cracker meal; two of the cheapest ingredients possible. But I digress. They have yummy borscht too. Latkes with sour cream. Now I'm getting hungry.Don't forget to ask for a pickle tray. Oh yummy, crunchy pickles! Your tangy sourness makes my tastebuds sing. There are crunchy bagel chips too.I usually get the pastrami reuben. Veggies take note: veggie reubens are delicious and a nice change of pace. The fries are average; not always hot which is a big no-no.I guess Canter's easily get two stars from me because I can pretend I'm in NYC. You can even extend the fantasy by going across the street to Damiano's, the pizza joint. Not that you'll be hungry but I guess you could have an unusual beer. I digress again. Canter's marries an East Coast vibe with old school Hollywood gumshoe, tragic romance. The bar is tits. You can practically see Bukowski on a bar stool at 2 p.m. on a Tuesday. They pour 'em stiff and the price is right. Wander in on any given random day and you will definitely see some characters. There may only be three, two, or one person but I guarantee your curiosity will be aroused. They book the weirdest bands (you never know what you will get) and it's not really recommended on a Friday or Saturday night (amateur hipsters, crowded, smoky sidewalk). Please order only respectable drinks like whiskey or scotch. The "Sex and the City" movie may be hot but Cosmos went out YEARS ago (and they are gross). The fact that you can order a real drink in the restaurant contributes to the stars above as well. It was quite dangerous when I lived around the corner. A great neighborhood. That stretch of Fairfax from approximately Wilshire to Melrose being one of the very few reminding me of NYC (where else? maybe Downtown?).I probably haven't eaten that many different things at Canter's but it doesn't matter. I just love the whole scene. The people watching cannot be beat and you will see an occasional celeb. I once saw Mike Myers outside. I'm the farthest thing from a star-f*cker but I had to holler to him how great he is. He and his wife smiled. Yay.Let's not forget the bakery. Authentic bagels-poppy, onion, everything-and some not-so-authentic bagels-pizza-are winners. You will become lost in a world of cookies, cheesecakes, rugala (recommended!), and marble ryes. A very wide selection of breads baked on the premises are available. A sweet-tooth fiend's (like me!) heaven!Canter's is also a good place to go hang out and have a casual meeting or get some work done. Their large center room is not always open (if not crowded) but they will let you spread out and work there, and, obviously, order something. The service can be inattentive and even verge on the border of being rude or hostile. While I normally cannot tolerate that, this only adds a little more East Coast zing in the mix. I have also had cut-and-dry competency which is my favorite type of service. Get it right, get it quick, no smarmy small talk. Canter's you make me misty-eyed for the Big Apple but you offer a little slice to keep me going.	1
If you're willing to ignore the pretentious hostess (she does truly just look miserable to be seating the beautiful patrons of toast) and the generally slow service, you won't have any problems appreciating the appeal of Toast.Every menu item is delicious AND healthy (the portobello press - pesto, mozzarella, portobello mushrooms, olives, sun-dried tomatoes - OMG) and they've the best soup selection I've seen in years (not to mention their dressing options). There's literally something for everyone at Toast, and I've never left dissatisfied with my meal.Although it's clearly a place to 'see and be seen,' Toast is 100% worth the long weekend-afternoon wait. Just try their fresh-squeezed orange juice and tell me you disagree.	1
Great restaurant. Family owned and everything is made by them. True Italian taste. The spaghetti and meatballs are my favorite and the tiramisu is perfect.	1
If I could give this place negative stars I would. The food is just not good! I can't say it any more plainly. Food: I ordered the philly cheesesteak. 1) The meat was tough as ALL HELL FROZEN OVER 2) The onions were not cooked enough and still had bite in them 3) the bread was like an old hot dog bun or something. Also, I don't think their black and white cookies are even comparable to those at other delis.Atmosphere: The ceiling consists of transparent fall leaf tiles that look like they belong on a polyester shirt. In fact, the whole place looks like a wormhole to the 70s and not in a good way (yes, I believe there IS a good way). Service: Rude. Just plain rude. Not even rude coming from attractive men aspiring toward Hollywood stardom, but from mumbling ladies faintly laced with cigarette smoke. The line to buy something from the deli can take forever, especially during peak hours. When you get to the front be prepared for additional rudeness.	0
This place is gross. Food and health needs to inspect this place.	0
Fast, friendly service and they deliver to Lizard&#39;s. It&#39;s always tasty and fresh. Such a welcome addition to the neighborhood!	1
Pretty good but too much fatty brisket. Go to Milk Burger. It&#39;s so much better.	0
When I only ordered sandwiches I was doing it all wrong. The way to go is to get a half chicken and the 1/3 slab combo with brisket. Insane amount of food? Yes. Worth getting to try all the best parts of the menu? Yes!	0
I've been to R&G Lounge several times and the food is OK. Nothing to write home about, but not too expensive considering it's filled with business people. Normally 3 stars, but unfortunately today was a 1 star day. I ordered a chicken cashew rice plate, and the chicken looked like either chunks overcooked fish or malformed scallops. It didn't taste like chicken; tasted like overcooked fish, but the waiter confirmed that it was, fact, chicken.I've hardly ever returned food at a restaurant, but this called for it. I called the waiter over and told him that I would like to return it, and he seemed stunned. He said "I cannot do that." Then he called over the manager. Here is the conversation that ensued:Me: Hi. Sorry, but I'd like to return this chicken. Manager: What, you don't like it?Me: No, sorry. Could I please return it and get something else?Manager: But you ordered it. It's your fault.Me: Ummm... yes, I did order it. Sometimes at restaurants if people order food and don't like it, they return it and get a refund or can order something else instead.Manager: I cannot give you a full refund. You can pay for half.Me: You mean, I will pay for half, and you will give me a different dish?Manager: No, you pay for half, then order a different dish and pay full price for that dish. Would you like to order something else?Me: No thanks. I'll just pay half price for this.So much for customer service!	0
Perfect place to start a party night. Great food great drinks. The view of downtown skyline is awesome.	1
I am vacationing in South Florida, so I have eaten at 3 different Cuban restaurants, and this one was my least favorite. The beef and chicken emapandas taste bland. The house salad was a lump of iceburg lettuce with a few garbanzo beans. If you must eat there stick with black beans, rice, and sweet fried plantains. Stay away from the huge lump of beef in the kid&#39;s burger yuck.. dry as a bone.	0
The guacamole! Oh the guacamole!!! This is a definite must have when you go to Escuela. The tacos are on the small side but they have some really great unique options. My favorite is the crispy beef and pickle taco. I would highly recommend trying that one. <br><br>The service is a bit slow but the place is always crowded so I can&#39;t fault them too much for that. This place would get 5 stars from me if the service was a bit more on their game. But overall this is a really great joint for some delicious Mexican food.	1
**I did NOT eat here**<br><br>Pretentious staff. Overly crowded. Two hour wait. Shallow wine pour. <br><br>Wanted to dine here for a few years now, and upon finally attempting to, I was nothing but disappointed with the experience. I totally expected to wait, but two hours with zero waiting room and a snobby staff wasn&#39;t worth it. I ordered a glass of wine (to drink on the cement outside) and for $12 I received a tasting pour. I noticed an older couple waiting next to me kindly tell the server that their wine pours were very shallow and that they hated to complain but would like to be topped off, and the server basically just said, &#34;Too bad,&#34; and walked away briskly. I took my shot of wine and kept my mouth shut. <br><br>Needless to say I left, and I won&#39;t be back. I am sure the food is amazing, but sometimes even that is not worth it.	0
The reviews citing the small portions and absurd prices are right on. The food is definitely good but the pasta dishes (entrees) take up about 1/4 of a regular small cereal bowl. The chicken liver was great as was the bread. Further, what is a Red Hook restaurant doing with a $24 glass of wine on the menu. What&#39;s more, our server seemed totally unaware of the quality of the wine. My wife wondered which wine was dryest, the waitress read off the menu and based her suggestion on that. The glass was $15.	0
Pancakes are HUGE so share with someone. Cash only, I went early saturday morning and waited about 30 minutes for 2. Not bad but standing there as if I was waiting for an awesome concert ehhh not the business. The also have another line for those who want to sit at the counter and its normally shorter from what I have seen.<br><br>Simple menu, good food and great prices. Love how all the employees have been there for double digit years makes it feel homey.	1
Excellent! <br>I got the large BBQ beef plate and it was delicious. It comes with a good amount of beef and the dressing on the salad is very good too.	1
I'm from out of town and was looking for a place to have some beer and some good food and this place was excellent. First of all, the waitress was very kind with great service and helpful advice for a couple newbies. The beer selection was great and we got a pitcher of a microbrew for $10, which I thought was a great price. The burgers were huge and very tasty along with the cheesecurds and fries. I will definitely visit this place again next time we're in town.	0
Meh. Just meh.Came here for breakfast one morning and left disappointed. I ordered the Pizza w/ Sunnyside Up Eggs and really wasn't a fan. The crust was too thin and too flaky. Boyfriend got the Eggs Fungi Poached w/ Roasted Mushrooms, which was a little better, but not amazing.As for the service, again, just meh. You get "meh" service from little hole-in-the-wall restaurants, not a place like this. For being such a prominent place in the heart of Los Feliz, I guess I just expected more... Especially for the price you're paying.	0
This place is a huge disappointment. Great location, spectacular view...everything else is not worth it at all. They lost our reservation, and once we were seated, we waited 20 minutes until the waitress even came to the table to take our drink order, then waited ANOTHER 20 minutes to get 2 glasses of wine, which were barely even filled half way at $14 a pop. They were out of all but one beer on the menu. The tuna tartar was virtually tasteless and wasn&#39;t made with the ingredients on the menu. The shrimp cocktail appetizer was doused in a wasabi sauce that tasted like it was straight from a tube at the grocery store. They were out of the red snapper and didn&#39;t bother to tell us until 15 minutes after we had ordered our meal. The poor waitress was slammed and the management didn&#39;t bother to help her at all. Everyone seemed so inattentive even though our table was in the middle of the room right next to the bar. The only good thing was their french fries- but they didn&#39;t come until after we had both finished our meal. <br><br>Not worth the money or the view :(	0
Great burger, nice atmosphere.	1
Ordered the penne chicken and mushroom which is 10.75 and and a medium cheese pizza which is 10.85 and somehow my total came up to 26.95. I asked the delivery driver if there was an extra charge for delivery he said no so I'm at a loss as to why they jacked the price up.	0
The service: A - The waiters are friendly & attentive.The food: A+ - Yes it's expensive, but the portions are large, the food tastes great, and the presentation is on point! I was told prior to going that the food was mediocre, however, my entire party thought the food was delicious! Lobster mac and cheese was the best so I highly recommend that as a must!Drinks: A - Everything was tasty and looked really cool. Their drinks are definitely on the stronger side. You're paying about $20 per drink, so at least they don't stiff you on the alcohol.Presentation: A+++ - Very unique!!Ambiance: A- - It's loud and very very crowded. If I could get more than 6 inches to move on either side of me, I would've been much happier. That's my only complaint about Barton G.Definitely somewhere you have to go at least once. But be prepared for the HEFTY price tag!! And I do mean, HEFTY!!!	1
This is a great place to enjoy a wonderful meal with a group. It is clear that the owners of The Kitchen understand their job -- to provide excellent service and outstanding food to their patrons. They carry this through to even the largest groups. We had attentive service on this very busy night. Our waiter didn&#39;t rush us and even took time to answer many questions posed by members of our group as well as offering his suggestions. <br>We all drank white wine by the bottle. I thought it was interesting that the pour was shallow, more like a taste than a full glass. Later I appreciated this strategy in that the glasses were refreshed often and it paced everyone in their drinking.<br>You must try the fresh oysters. The only thing wrong with them was that they disappeared from my plate too quickly, They were so good that I didn&#39;t even share them with others!	1
I stumbled across this place while wondering the streets of Seattle searching for the least romantic place to get a bite to eat on Vday. The ingredients were great and fresh and the price was perfect. The pizza came fast and hot. Great find!	1
I tried the Umami burger, tempura onion rings and sweet potato fries. Keep in mind that they do cook their burgers medium rare. The burger was moist and juicy. I really enjoyed the bun that they used for the burger. The sweet potato fries with the garlic aioli was my favorite part of the meal because it had a nice balance of flavors. To top it off, I found out that one of our friends works there who I haven't seen in years. So that was a nice touch! =]	1
The hostess was wonderful, the man who came to take our drink order was amazing. The waiter was distracted. The salmon was delicious, all 2oz of it. My friend's burger was juicy and delicious. Drinks were quite good. I'd like to give it another chance; but seriously, the size of the salmon portion was a joke. I would have brought it up with the staff but I had a concert to get to. Flavors were good, ambiance very nice. It's been there forever so they must be doing something right.	0
Meh.  It was ok, but honestly, didn't have enough flavor.  Honestly, Popeye's does it better.  The dining room, show venue, bowling alley was really great though.  Would love to come back with a group of friends for a fun night of music and bowling.  Food was a 3 but venue is a 4.5.	1
This place is great. Two brothers making traditional Tunisian food with passion and care. Hummus, pita, grilled chicken and salads are all amazing! Can&#39;t wait to try the rest of the menu.	1
Great experience at Perch. I wanted a romantic dinner for my SO&#39;s birthday with very specific instructions that involved presentation of a gift, champagne, and dessert. They got us a great table with a view, the food was delicious (albeit expensive), the view was beautiful, the live music was good, and the overall atmosphere was exactly what I wanted. The hosts and server were excellent at making it happen. Not sure how to top that next year.	1
Had the bone in rib eye. The meat was cooked to order.  The bread was excellent.  It took a little too long for the salad to come out.	1
Had great seating even after snagging a last minute 7:45pm reservation. The food was great but not amazing, and the service was decent but not stellar. I asked to replace lettuce in my salad for arugula and the server refused, despite having arugula on the menu. Some of the dishes could have had better presentation but still overall pretty yummy. Love the decor, which is reminiscent of a more upscale The Smith restaurant	1
My sister and I had reservations for dinner here on a Friday evening. We were staying at The Orlando hotel, which is where this restaurant is located. It's a very trendy, hipster looking place (i.e. they serve water in mason jars). We sat outside which is a really nice set up with pretty lights - definitely a nice place for a date!We ended up getting their corn pizza, tuscan kale salad, and mac and cheese. The corn pizza was pretty good! It had lamb pancetta, serrano chiles, sundried tomatoes, and arugula. It had the perfect combo of sweet and savory. I don't know if they put it on, but it had an almost truffle oil hint on it. YUM! The kale salad was also good, with goat cheese, currants, raisins, and meyer lemon. Kale can usually taste pretty bitter, but not this one!As for the mac and cheese....ew. I don't recommend this dish unless you like your mac and cheese tasting like nacho cheese/Velveeta. Not only was the cheese too artificial tasting, but the macaroni was swimming in the cheese, which I personally don't like. We didn't like it so much that we requested to switch it for another dish. Our waitress was very accommodating and switched it no problem - great service! We ended up getting their cauliflower dish - recommended by our waitress. HOLY CRAP IT WAS SO GOOD. Definitely made up for the mac and cheese. The cauliflower had a lot of spices on it - reminding me a lot of curry flavors. As if that wasn't good already, there was a creamy sauce underneath the cauliflower which went amazingly with it! Probably my favorite dish out of everything we ordered - highly recommended!!Overall a pretty satisfying meal. Good food (aside from the mac and cheese) and solid service! Wouldn't come out of my way to eat here, but it was definitely an enjoyable place since I was in the area :)	1
Ok Umami, you win.Friday night 8 of us went here for a friend's birthday. My friend and I decided to split 2 of their special burgers. One of which was the Pork Belly burger and the other the Turkey BLTA.The Pork Belly burger, while I'm not ENTIRELY sure what was all on it included a blend of pork/beef for the meat, covered with thick chunks of bacon, some form of special (not too hot) hot sauce, onions, and avocado. This was pure heaven in burger form. I wished we wouldn't have split this one, but I was honestly just about full from that half. My mouth was seriously so happy with each and every bite that I took.Next up was my half of the Turkey BLTA (this might have another special name, but I wasn't paying much attention to the names, just the tastes). Simple: turkey burger, bacon, cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato, and avocado. It was good, not GREAT, but it was exactly what I expected a turkey burger to taste like... a little bland, not as juicy, but still really tasty.We also ordered the Cheesy Tots which I guess are a special menu item as well, I didn't taste much cheese, but tots + their ketchup are more than worth ordering so I disregarded the fact that they were supposed to be "cheesy." As for beverages, most of the table ordered Cherry cokes (the adult kind)... I have no idea what was in them, but they were strong, sweet, and included the rest of the mexican coke that was poured into them. MMM... mexican coke. One of my weaknesses.My table also ordered the pickle platter because they pickle their own... pickles... I'm not a fan of pickles, but it seemed to be a big hit with my table. Last but not least, my biggest gripe with my previous visit... the service. I wanted to murder my waitress from my original visit, but this time, our waitress Erin (what a great name!) was a total sweet heart, she was attentive, polite, and totally kick ass. For a Friday night I didn't expect such wonderful service, but she was awesome and got us everything we needed when we asked for it. I will definitely revisit Umami if the opportunity presents itself, but I think my waistline will tell me stay away. I ate way too much food but was totally and completely satisfied.	1
I end up coming here about once or twice a year on their <a href="/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&amp;s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">restaurant.com</a>. But after last time I think I need to make it more like once a month. Came here with a group of 4 with a 50 to spend 10 deal. <br><br>The food is always solid but the service from Constance was over the top amazing.<br><br>I always get the goat cheese fondue and I will always continue too.<br><br>The potato leak soup that was on special was probably the tastiest thing I had all night. Best potato leak ever.<br><br>The mac n cheese was good but not the best I&#39;ve had in town. It&#39;s very indulgent so get it to share. The salmon entree is exceptional. A perfect glaze on top of a crispy flaked salmon steak.<br><br>The desserts were good but not the best creme brule I&#39;ve ever had. The chocolate brownie was good but also not the most amazing I&#39;ve had.<br><br>Overall the tab for 4 came to $160 with the discount and tip included. Would have been cheaper is we wouldn&#39;t have gone all out (3 apps, 2 desserts, etc).<br><br>To save we brought our own wine and the 12.50 corkage is very reasonable.	1
If you like something different this is the perfect place!! I love their friendly service and all their dishes had the same price of 10 dollars!!! I loved their charshiu pork skewer and also their pork belly some!!	1
This place sucks! Never order their food to go. I ordered the chicken noodle soup and asked them to replace the noodles with vegetables because I dont eat noodles. When i get my order all it is, is greasy tasteless broth two tiny bits of chicken and ALL BEAN SPROUTS! I called the place back and told them that I had ordered vegetables instead of noodles but all I got were bean sprouts. The lady refused to give me a new soup and said I have to specify "MIxed Veggies" next time and vegatables mean bean sprouts... which is total BULLSHIT! I asked if I could get a new soup and she said no... I order from here at least twice a week and they cant replace a $5 dollar soup? F*** This PLACE!	0
After all the hype, I was VERY disappointed with this place. I always order the regular shio ramen with shredded pork. The shredded pork here was so bland and dry. Pork buns were average. There wasn&#39;t enough soup in the bowl and I ended up drinking all the soup halfway through my meal which is always bad. The quality of the soup was not up to par as Ippudo or Momofuku. When I was halfway done with my meal, the waitress plopped my receipt down which was absolutely rude of them. Can&#39;t I enjoy my lunch in peace?	0
If you want to go back in time for a good burger, Apple Pan is the place! <br><br>It&#39;s hard to think of a better combination than a burger, fries, Coke, and apple pie. And when the food is as fresh and tasty as this place, it makes it even better!<br><br>The layout of the place is a little strange. It&#39;s essentially one large counter surrounding the place. Makes it hard to go with a bunch of people since it&#39;s typically packed. The plaid on the walls is hilarious and a great touch showing how old-timey this place is. The service is unbelievably fast and if for some reason you do have to wait, trust me, it&#39;s worth it. <br><br>The burgers and pie taste like something you would have eaten at a BBQ as a kid. Real homemade goodness, nothing like a fast food burger. The old school flair continues in everything from the cash register to the staff to the paper cups. <br><br>Only downsides are the lack of seating, the seating style and line make you feel rushed to eat, the prices are a little on the higher side, and I don&#39;t believe they take credit cards. <br><br>Either way, this is a burger place that is worth every penny.	1
Came here on a Wednesday night for dinner and a cocktail. Had been wanting to stop by for a while but never got to it. Glad I finally did. Went with the filet mignon as the entree. I made a good choice. Full of flavor. Ambiance is cool and the lighting is just the way I like it. The majority of people here are dressed to impress. That's another plus. No kids or hoodlums, very chill crowd. Will be back	1
As many have mentioned the menu is huge and slightly confusing/daunting maybe even a little overpowering. I walked in with my sister and straight off we liked the location and aesthetic. I knew i wanted the banana french toast and she ordered an egg sandwich. I also ordered a chocolate milk (please note I am a chocolate milk connoisseur). <br><br>Well I am sad to say, I was disappointed first in my chocolate milk which somehow tasted watery, yuckkky. And then in my french toast, which I ended up scraping the cinnamon and bananas out of.<br><br>My sister faired better but wasn&#39;t really impressed either.<br><br>This place is not a destination dine, where you&#39;ll come here for the food. Instead, it is a quick fix type of place and not a cheap one at that.<br><br>I might go back because when I mentioned my experience a friend told me I should go for lunch.... maybe I&#39;ll need an easy go to but it won&#39;t be my first choice.	0
Excellent atmosphere, unbelievably fresh seafood, and amazing cocktails that are unique and refreshing. Highly recommended for a special occasion, or just a night of &quot;wow's&quot;.	1
Everything about this restaurant was wonderful, the service made my party feel like family with the Italian hospitality, the food was amazing and was the portion sizes were just perfect. I had littleneck clams in a white wine sauce over linguine and it was absolutely delicious. The tiramisu was very light and creamy and was a great combo with the cappuccino. I was highly satisfied and would recommend Lucia's for anyone wanting a true Italian meal in a cozy setting.	1
Best Bloody Mary!	1
There are so many things that make this place a keeper! It feels like you are inside a postcard of the Los Angeles skyline. The outdoor fireplaces &amp; bench seat tables add a sense of community within your group. Everything I tasted was flavorful &amp; rich. The Brie pastry appetizer, the wild mushroom risotto and the Brussels sprouts we&#39;re my favorite items on the menu.	1
Well, we've found our new favorite brunch spot around green lake. We had the Bailey's French Toast, which was a perfectly cooked, thickly cut piece of delicious brioche. We also had the Winner Winner Chicken Fritter. The presentation was spectacular and the food even better. We will definitely be back, both for the brunch, and anytime we need some bacon or a cheesecake for an event - all their cured meats and pastries looked amazing as well.	1
Great tasting food!!!!	1
Came here for a girls get together after not having seen everyone in a long time. Was looking forward to seeing everyone and having a good time. Now first looking at the place online, it says it is small. But when you get there they really mean it, the place is tiny. Though there are three levels, all are each just as small as the other and one server per floor. We didnt really mind this at first because it creates a cozy and intimate experience. <br>We started off with the happy hour at the bar on the second level while we waited for our table and then were shown our seats on the third floor. The food is good but does not out way the service that we experienced. My friends and I are between 23-26 years old. We were the youngest people there and as such we were ignored and had to call numerous times to get someones attention. The other tables had no such problem. We asked for the desert menu twice before just giving up and paying for our bill, which also took forever to get. <br>Dont get me wrong, the food was good. But I would not go back just for that. Maybe the bar. If they had more people helping, then perhaps it would be a better time.	0
Upper is not as crowded, more spacious and quieter than its lower counterpart. Same great service and drink, the edibles are better here as well as the seating.	0
Banzo knows their beans.	0
Took my visiting brother there for breakfast and was very happy. We shared two different breakfast crepes and they were both outstanding. A cozy homey atmosphere good coffee and nice employees rounded out the experience. I'd definitely go again if I was in the neighborhood.	1
I love that they deliver, and the service is prompt. I'll get them sometimes, but I've never been blown away by how good the burritos actually are.	0
Shhhhhh.....nobody let this restaurant get out, I fear the Goldie will come and blow up this small reesturant in an unassuming plaza. I was going to Zion market to pick up some stuff, and my hankering for Korean anything but BBQ has finally led my footsteps here. I have the ethnic food 3 signs of awesome.<br><br>Number 1. Can I understand the menu on the wall? Nope. So check<br><br>Number 2. Is it filled with it&#39;s intended ethnic group and nothing else? Check.<br><br>Number 3. Is it damn loud and busy? Check!<br><br>I had d the kimchi kal gyusol and it came in a portion bigger than my face. I just couldn&#39;t seem to put a dent in that thing. I brought it home to my boyfriend and he finished it up.<br><br>It was so good! Just...awesome. Perfect for a night of drinking. One thing to note is that don&#39;t expect good service. Service is terrible, but I&#39;m used to it and could care less if the food makes up for it. And it did!	1
Nothing special with this place.	1
I raise them one star for their stance on the micro beer issue.  People are starting to wake up that we have the power to fight back and fight we will. Great Dane is doing the absolute right thing. Thank you Great Dane!	0
Great food and ambience. Had their thai beef salad after the gym. My friend loved their curry! Planning on going back for sure.	1
one star for serviceone star for locationbland tasteless food. if it wasn't for happy hour, i'd be even more pissed. i thought i'd order a variety of appetizers to get a good idea of their food so i got a bowl of chowder, the steamed mussels, the boil and peel shrimp, and cajon corn on the cobb. just horrible. everything was tasteless and quality sucked. for $13, i'd expect the shrimp to be a little more fresh and tasty. But i guess they got it wrong. only thing great was the service. i wont be coming back here again. that's for sure.	0
I went to World of Beer with my friends last Friday and we ordered a bottle of wine and shared it. I didn&#39;t see the receipt until my friend gave it to me which is two days later. When I saw the receipt, I found out that the wine charged on the receipt is not the one we order and it&#39;s more expensive. The wine showed on my receipt is not even on the bar&#39;s menu. I called back the first time and the manager explained that they are going to change the whole menu for next month (Jan, 2015) and the wine on my receipt is one of the coming menu WHICH IS NOT ON THE CURRENT MENU. However, the manager refused to refund the difference because she said that we already drank the bottle! I called back and argued with her that we are not supposed to pay for the bottle which is not on the menu. She said she need to &#34;make a call&#34; before she can reply me. Finally she agreed to refund me the stupid difference. Guys, please be careful when you sign your check because they might put the wrong bottle on your check and charge you more!	0
don&#39;t go here. the potatoes were the only good thing. pancakes sucked. french toast sucked. eggs were good, but that&#39;s hard to screw up.	0
Vegas has it's share of top notch dining spots but you should certainly give B&amp;B a shot.  Don't miss the octopus appetizer which is fantastic!! (and I don't even like seafood that much).Also the salumi sampler is just out of this world.  Everything is cured in house and tastes simple divine.  The cotto and capricola were very good, as were the cured loin but the star, and excuse me because I don't recall the exact name, was the porcetta which looks like proscuitto but its 10 times better.  The fat simply melts in your mouth like butter.  My words can't do it justice.  When ordered for 2, the sampler comes with fried dough which is really the icing on the cake.  The pasta was very good but nothing special I am sad to say. Having eaten at Babbo and Del Posto in NY, I expected better. But I think it would be different had we had  the pasta tasting menu which is definitely more inventive.  Still, don't let me dissuade you, give it a try.	1
Ambitious menu foiled by incredibly bad service.<br><br>I&#39;ve been here many times over the years, I live right down the street. This place is so inconsistent, you never really know what to expect. But after my last visit I&#39;m not sure if there&#39;s anything that can get me to go back.<br><br>The waiter was way too busy to, um, wait on us. When he did grace us with his presence he proved that he knew nothing about the food that was on the menu.<br><br>I asked about a fish dish which he described as, &#34;kind of like a Sea Bass&#34; and that it was &#34;grilled&#34;. What I got was a tiny trout-like fish steamed in parchment paper. It took a lifetime for our main courses to arrive and when my entree came it was barely warmer than room temperature. I was starving so I ate it anyway. I think it would have been good if it was warm. <br><br>My girlfriend asked if her dish would come with vegetables since she was craving veggies. He assured her, yes. When it came it was actually a bouillabaisse in which the vegetables were pureed inside the broth. No visible veggies at all. At least her dish was hot and, despite the lack of greenery, it was pretty good. <br><br>Then our dirty dishes stayed on our table forever as we tried to flag down our waiter for the check. This was on a Wednesday and not even very busy. It seemed like we were at this restaurant for an eternity. <br><br>The ambience and menu is what makes this place so popular and I have had good experiences here in the past. But bad service spoils the whole experience for me so I think I&#39;ll head to Blair&#39;s the next time I&#39;m in the mood for fine dining in Silverlake.	0
Came here for brunch today and was extremely disappointed. My bf ordered eggs benedict and I ordered the baked eggs dish which came with spinach, potatoes, bacon and potatoes. We also ordered the ricotta pancake to share because they ran out of the french toast. Who runs out of french toast on Easter sunday?! I can only assume these people prepare everything in advance and pop it in to cook as the orders come. The fact that the chefs weren't willing to whip up fresh new batches of french toast irks me. The pancake we got was also uncooked. The middle of the pancake oozed uncooked batter. For our main dishes, everything was so oversalted it was inedible. The bacon they serve is really chunks of ham, not the classic crispy strips that I crave. Our service was fine and for being packed, we were in and out quick. Honestly, I am done giving this place a chance. I really had to restrain from sending everything back and complaining. Easter brunch = fail	0
I actually love the food and am a frequent customer of this restaurant. However, my last experience with them left me incredibly upset. I ordered food online for delivery. After the estimated 45 minute wait time was up, I called the place to get an update. The employee I spoke with said he would call his driver and get an update. He then said the driver had already left and my food was headed to me. I live literally 2 minutes driving from this place. No food about an hour later. I call again. The employee says again, &#34;oh let me call the driver.&#34; So now I question whether he called the driver in the first place. So I just cancel my order. A total of 2 hours pass and I get a call that my food had arrived. So this tells me that the employee never called the driver to inquire about the status of my food and was blatantly lying to me. Clearly I went to another Thai spot to get food. I was highly disappointed because I did like this place so much and was a regular customer.	0
I don&#39;t really write reviews on anywhere, but I had to today. This was one of our favorite restaurants until what happened today. The lady who answered the phone has no courtesy/customer service whatsoever. There was a mistake on our delivery order so we returned the food and called the restaurant to let them know what happened. First, the man answered the phone, so my husband explained about the situation and the man was being very kind and apologetic. But all of a sudden, this lady (who took the order in the beginning) snatched the phone and started yelling at my husband saying that it was all his fault. Okay..so if it was our fault and she let us know in a kind way, we would&#39;ve admitted and apologized, but she was being so bitchy and yelled at my husband nonstop. (it was so loud that i could hear her voice over the phone). We couldn&#39;t believe how she treated us/customers like that. Se was very very rude and felt like she needs anger management class. Wish I could give neg stars!	0
I am used to being able to find some dishes such as humus made with olive oil at mediterranean restaurants. I tried to find out if this restaurant has some of these dishes by phone but it was too hard to understand the man. So we then went to the restaurant hoping to get our questions answered. The owner a man was entirely rude. As far as he was concerned he had done any answering he was willing to do on the phone. He refused to answer our questions. Pretty much everything was made with vegetable oil which is GMO oils like soybean corn and canola. I believe his total rudeness had to do with me being a woman - who should be seen and not heard like in the country he is from. Finally I asked if he had tea and he said no basically refusing to serve us. A female relative embarrassed by him tried to help us despite him but we left. We have since found House of Kabob on Colorado Blvd that uses olive oil exclusively. And everything is delicious!	0
An utter disaster.	0
Yum. Yum. Yum.<br><br>My husband and i headed here one crisp fall morning for some coffee and crepes. We were not disappointed.<br><br>The place wasn&#39;t busy when we walked in, but it was early, maybe 8:30 on a Sunday morning. We chose a cute little table and ordered coffee pretty quickly. Their coffee was great. It takes a little bit of extra time because it&#39;s from a french press, but it is worth it!<br><br>For crepes, both of us went with savory after much debating - they all sounded delicious! I had the chicken, mushroom and cheese ( I chose Swiss) crepe, and my husband had the chicken and caramelized onion with avocado sauce crepe. Both were served wit ha side of sriracha. We both tried the other&#39;s crepe and both were really good, but I think the chicken and onion one was just a tad tastier. Maybe it was the perfectly done caramelized onions with just a hint of spice when you added the sriracha, but I&#39;m STILL thinking about it.<br><br>When we left around 10:15, there were a couple of other tables taken, so it still wasn&#39;t super busy. This would be a great place to bring a great book, relax on one of the couches, and just linger. I even commented that I thought this would be great for a girlfriends&#39; lazy brunch or a book club.<br><br>Parking wasn&#39;t bad (we parked across the street), but it was early in the morning. It&#39;s the time of day that I like to say the city hasn&#39;t woken up yet.<br><br>Quite the neighborhood gem. Try this place.	1
Top reasons why they deserve a 5 star from me. - they're open 24hrs - love their chipotle chicken panini - love their plate (grilled chicken)- plain cheesecake have just the right amount of sugar for me - most important they deliver anytime of the day and night!!! Have pretty much tried all their sandwiches but the chipotle chicken panini is what I would recommend.	1
I ate there last month -the food was OK but the place need some cleaning and renewing. friendly staff.	0
I came here with my family for Dine LA, and was not disappointed! For appetizer, I got the heirloom tomatoes with burrata cheese, which was amazing. I loved the combination. I ordered the fish dish - forget the name of it but it was from Hawaii and tasted very mild. Worked well with the savory veggies. And last but not least, I tried the chocolate mousse which was delicious and not too sweet. I also got to sample food from my family, and I really liked the butter lettuce and the panna cotta dessert.This place gets a little busy on Fridays especially with the LACMA events so book an appointment in advance. We were able to get a reservation at 8:15.	1
I hardly ever write a review, but my experience here was TERRIBLE. First, the service was horrid. Our waitress brought out our order wrong but insisted that we ordered what she brought us. We did not. When we kindly asked her if we could have our platter made into a wrap, she told us the kitchen was too busy. Second, the food was atrocious. My beef was full of fat and blandly seasoned. My friend&#39;s chicken was still pink. I will never return.	0
Granted, I came here with an extremely large group, but it was brunch and we were not rowdy. The food was alright, nothing amazing, but the service really sucked. We were all very nice and polite to the waitress but she was snarky and had a big attitude problem. We had all sent in our orders a week in advance, but after waiting for an hour for our food, I asked if mine was ready. She snapped that we had come in last, so no, it wasn't ready. Whaaaaaaaaale, soooorrrry, what was the point in sending in our order a week early then? I make it a point to be extra courteous to service staff, so it really grinds my gears when I get a crock of undeserved rudeness in return.	0
This is such a nice place .. We were early for our opentable reservation and it was freezing out ...and the restaurant was not open for another 45 mins for dinner.. The hostess kindly let us hang out at bar and have a drink and warm up..<br><br>We had a beet salad that was fresh and delicious and I had the pork, for dinner, which was very tasty ... By friend ordered the grass fed beef and they mistakenly put in the order as a cheddar burger.. When that came it looked so amazing I wanted to keep it lol.. They apologized profusely and insisted on fixing it and giving us free drinks for the error.. The manager, waitress, hostess and bartender all over to apologize.. The beef and fingerling potatoes were fabulous when they came.. Dessert was a treat as well.. A custard with pistachios with a caramelized top with ice cream ... The bill was incorrect as we received someone else&#39;s. It took awhile to fix but the food was so good and the service so attentive that we didn&#39;t mind too much.. Nice atmosphere.. Will definitely go back to try their brunch.	1
Pros: -Gorgeous View -Atmosphere/Vibe/Diversity -strong, yet tasty drinks-Heat Lamps outside-cheap $5 parking lot on the corner (rare at a hot spot in downtown la)Cons:-FOOD.Cordon Bleu Poppers- kind of dry, but tastyDuck, Duck, Goose - my girlfriends said it was goodPetite Croque Madam - This was decent and probably the best food we ordered of the 5 dishesPork Confit Cassulet - Good portion since it's an entree, but very saltyRoasted Bone Marrow - utter disappointment. If you want delicious bone marrow, go to "Animal"	1
Beautiful restaurant with decent food, slightly on the more expensive side though. I&#39;d say not worth coming back for the food (however the atmosphere is divine)	1
I've been to the Magnolia Pub & Brewery three times and each time I kept wishing the place would deliver. Always going back at the urging of my alleged, "Hip" friends. This place definitely struck out. I just don't understand the attraction. This is the worst wait service I've come across in this city. The beer is mediocre at best. It has zero ventilation not to mention zero room for diners. On top of all that, just try and carry on a conversation with someone in this place. Absolutely impossible. Definitely not worth the trouble.	0
SO SO yummy! portion size isn't huge, but definitely worth it flavor wise!	1
Amazing Greek food! Shrimp spaghetti is the best I&#39;ve had and the pita can&#39;t be beat, our server was Roslin, definitely the best server we&#39;ve had in a long time, fast, personable, and helpful with explaining the dishes, had the pleasure of meeting and talking to the owner Helen, very sweet lady besides the smell of alcohol on her breath which to me is unprofessional especially considering we can&#39;t have a drink because they don&#39;t have their license yet! Lol I&#39;m sure she was trying to be helpful but she seemed to be trying to talk over Roslin when she was trying to get our order, again just unprofessional maybe waiting until the actual server is done getting our order and explaining the food before she goes to tables to chat would be better or more professional/respectful, the chef came and checked on us and made sure the food was to our liking overall great experience good job and welcome to the neighborhood	1
Appetizers are junk, seafood isn&#39;t fresh, but at least the steak dishes are pretty rad and and the live music is fun.	0
What the heck is going on with Daikokuya lately? That's actually where I was supposed to eat, but with this cold weather, it seems like EVERYONE wants to eat there too! I guess great minds think alike? The wait was 30 minutes minimum and it was a crazy house in there with people waiting around, so Restaurant Oomasa here I go!I've walked by Oomasa plenty of times but had never even been inside. Right away I liked that there were Japanese people (I think authenticity when I can get it) and they had picnic benches as tables! Good for groups!I wanted some soup since I didn't get to have any ramen, so I ordered Miso. Apparently there are different kinds of miso soup! Clam, seaweed, or mushroom he asked. I was confuzzled so I asked which one he liked the most and he said the clam was the most popular. Really???? Who knew right? So of course I had to try it. My friend and I both got it and I must say it was delish! You have to be a seafood/clam person to like it though. There were clams in the soup and the broth was a little clammy as well. MmmMMMm. I got the #4 dinner combination. Sashimi, sushi, salad, and chicken teriyaki. I had the sashimi (tuna and salmon only), the sushi, and the salad. WOW was the meal friggin huge! I didn't even touch the teriyaki but that's where my brother aka my garbage disposal comes in. They even give you green tea ice cream as well! Did I have it? Heck yes I did! I guess that's cheat meal #2 for the week but I'll just work extra hard. Green tea ice cream and sushi! How can I resist!!! Now THAT is the way to my heart. *sighGood service, good food, benches were a bit uncomfortable after a while but not bad, roomy seating, and an overall good time. :)	1
Love the restaurant, Ray&#39;s. They have great food and great service. Stark Bar has great drinks and food, but the service is a bit iffy. That&#39;s why only four stars. Every time I go to the bar, it takes a long time to get a drink and forever for the check.	1
I have definitely experienced better. If you want poke, i suggest going somewhere else. It looked fresh and all but the flavor is just not there. The fish just tasted bland. The Hawaiian style poke was missing something. The spicy garlic and spicy poke were just spicy. IT over power any possible flavors.Not sure how this place got great reviews. <br>location is hidden too. Not the easy to find. Especially if you are a new transplant to vegas. **points to self**<br>This is just my opinion. If you want to go try it out for yourself do it. Not everyone has the same taste buds. Mine just doesn&#39;t like this place.	0
Paseo is delicious.	1
I've been to this restaurant before with my husband this time went with a group of 8 of us. Chips and salsa were pretty good although you have to ask for it. I got the Wagyu beef tacos and they really were just not good at all. The beef was very chewy I even had two friends try it to make sure that it wasn't just me. However the reason I gave it four stars on service is because the manager came by and noticed that I hadn't eaten my dinner and was very apologetic and took it off our bill without us even asking. I did have the tortilla soup which is different than traditional tortilla soup but I thought it was fantastic. Overall I think it's a good place to go, everyone else's meals were really good no complaints and  the service was good too.	1
I had a wonderful dinner at Cliff's Edge for my birthday last night. First and foremost, the food was phenomenal! Chef Vartan has created some wonderful dishes. I was blown away by the potatoe fritters with lemon yoghurt sauce. The Brussels sprouts side dish was delicious! So tasty! For my entre I had the mussels. The only thing that could have made that dish any better is if our waitress had brought out extra bread. I had nothing to sop up all that yummy broth with. We sat on the patio which is the best spot in the house. It reminds me of a tropical rainforest. It's sheltered from the elements and heated. So awesome and super impressive! All around a great experience!!!!	1
Have been eating here 6-7 times and always very consistent. They really know pasta and most of all Meatballs! Kid friendly and staff is well trained. This is now a regular on our list every 2 weeks. Service is a little slow at times or it would be 5 stars.	1
My son and I had the Amazing Grace and Good Night Irene burgers, Belly fries, regular fries, and he had a Vanilla shake. The burgers are chuck and pork belly resulting in a great taste! The default preparation is Medium, which we both had. The Belly fries were to die for. At the bottom of the mini deep fry basket it got a little mush, but the top 80% were awesome. We also received butter cookies with each entree. I ate both of them when I got home. Screw the girl scouts, I want these! Finally, they have a HUGE selection of beer. Great place!!!	1
We came here last weekend for lunch and we were serviced quickly. The waitress was also very nice as she informed us that lunch prices don&#39;t change until 3:00 PM. (It was 2:57 pm). I am grateful for her honesty; so we saved about $5-6 bucks on our bentos.<br><br>We both ended up ordering the #6&#39;s. Very tasty and highly recommended. This was a great Japanese meal in the heart of Little Tokyo.	1
Big fan of this place.<br><br>Love the ambiance for both the indoor and outdoor seating options. Only drawback from sitting inside is small tables. Which do not serve well for party of 3.<br><br>Great food , awesome Sunday scene and waiting staff has always been pleasant as well.<br><br>A 4.5 star in my book.	1
Had to visit two nights in a row to before I could write a review.Highlights for the food:Bison Chili tacos (highly recommend!!)Pork Belly tacos Poc-chuk tacos (delicious and citrus-y).Lobster taco, while pretty good, didn't blow me away for the price.They have a great selection of beers (draft and bottle).We tried the michelada and it was good in theory, but just didn't work in practice.Not sure about the rest of you, but I like to drink my drink when it's served to me.Didn't feel like waiting for the spicy tomato popsicle to melt, nor was I in the mood to eat it while drinking the beer. The flavors were all there, but it seemed like more of a hassle than an entertaining way to serve a drink. Maybe a tomato granita perhaps so it melts faster?Seem like some smart people running the place, so I have faith they'll figure out what's working and what isn't for the neighborhood.	1
for sweet try the french toast. 	1
Ate here for the first time last night and wow is the food good!<br><br>I got the bahn mi burger which was amazing, as were the fries. The couple that work there are super lovely and friendly and you can tell they really care about the food they are putting out.<br><br>Such a great little place and can&#39;t wait to go back and try more!	1
What an amazing spot! If you aren&#39;t looking for this place, you won&#39;t find it. It is a little out of the way. The live music is great and the bartenders know how to mix a mean drink! I can&#39;t wait to come back for dinner.	1
This restaurant is really weird. I heard lots so suggested coming here for my b-day dinner with 2 girlfriends. I thought the shimmering interior design was sleek, but I couldn't connect the dots between such a choice and a Southern/Cajun restaurant. Presenting a type of cuisine with a twist is trendy, but I just couldn't get comfortable with 'fancied up' soul food. The music was alarmingly loud, and a live band came on that was also too loud, and they were tucked behind some booths and pillars. What's the point of having a live band if your customers can't even see the musicians? I had to try the famous watermelon margarita and was very disappointed; the chayenne pepper on the rim gave it a kick, but the drink tasted nothing like watermelon. Maybe the bartender had an off night?But mostly I knocked off stars for the absolutely horrible service we had. Our server seemed totally incompetent and not welcoming. We ordered the autumn salad (bland), candied yam (cold), and salmon croquette (so-so). For entrees we had the seafood jambalaya (hearty), fried chicken (good mac 'n cheese), and crab cake sandwich (humongous). The first 2 entrees were right, but the 3rd entree was the exact same salmon croquette we just had! And the runner even said this was the sandwich. We pointed this out to our server and she was confused. We were like, "Did you not notice that this is the EXACT same dish we just had? We ordered the crab cake!" She finally realized the mishap, apologized, and fixed it. The cornbread were very yummy, but we had to ask twice to get refill. Finally, good thing my friend checked the bill, but we were charged TWICE for the croquette!!$^#$$&** I was about to go maaaadddd! There really wasn't an excuse for service this bad.In conclusion: if you crave for some downright homely and delicious Southern food, skip the frills of Farmerbrown and head to Powell's in the Fillmore District. You get much better bang for your buck, and you're actually served by people who know how to serve.	0
I Love a place in Los Angeles that is open 24 hours!!!.....and to top it off, Fred's has great atmosphere, GREAT people watching, is relax/chill, fun... has a GREAT selection of Yummy things to eat - from eggs to udon (i like the udon!) (oh, and the eggs!)it gets crowded but sometimes a seat opens up at the counter if all the booths/tables are full.	1
This place is amazing. The food is fresh, healthy and so tasty. The people are so hospitable and helpful. The coffee is delicious (it&#39;s Panther). Can&#39;t recommend this place enough. Miami needs more spots like this one.	1
I ordered a pizza because I was hungry and thought it would be fun to try the mushroom pizza.<br><br>Person on the phone was speaking too fast/with an accent and miscommunicated important information (I had to repeat credit card and address info. I speak very clear English).<br><br>She told me that the pizza would be here in 20 minutes (which I thought was fast). But I could barely understand her so I said ok.<br><br>45 minutes later I call back (as the pizza had not been delivered) and tell her that I have to leave in 30 minutes. She then tells me that the driver will not make it and argues the time she told me.<br><br>I don&#39;t care either way, I am more annoyed that she argued with me instead of finding a solution. At this point I don&#39;t care how good the pizza is, I will not be a customers of theres. I would guess that their service is worse at the location. I&#39;ll rush and drive to another pizza place instead.<br><br>I rarely leave reviews.	0
Shortly after you arrive and order drinks and such, the Chef Romeo comes out and asks about allergies and likes and dislikes. After that, your dinner lies solely in his hands. Some dishes were absolutely spectacular but others were alright. Service was great, Chef Romeo came out to check on us more than once. I wound recommend it mostly for experience alone.	1
I stepped into this small and fairly new restaurant for a dinner alone. <br>With a warm welcome I was greeted and seated. As I sat down I was given 5 banchan(side dishes). They were all very clean and refreshing and tasted like my mom&#39;s banchan. They said that their specialty is noodles as that is obvious in their name. I ended up ordering their spicy kalgooksoo noodle(?). As the noodle came out, I was astonished by the size of the bowl. The noodle was nothing like I tried before. I&#39;ve been to Myungdong, Olympic Noodle, and Hangari Bajirak before, but this place was different. It was almost like comfort food, what my mom would&#39;ve cooked for me. And they said that they don&#39;t use any MSG, which is almost impossible in a Korean restaurant. But I think that&#39;s believable because I didn&#39;t drink gallons of water afterwards. If you&#39;re expecting whole lot of shebang and exotic Korean food, this may not be your place but for a cozy and clean home food I do recommend.	1
LOVE THIS PLACE!!! <br><br>Been here multiple times, and they always hit the nail on the head. Pizza&#39;s were fresh and delicious. Papperdelle has just enough kick in the bolognese. I don&#39;t normally enjoy cauliflower, but their&#39;s was perfectly seasoned.<br><br>The selection of craft beers was impressive and I especially enjoy their Sauvignon Blanc!! Definitely coming back and telling all of my friends!!!	1
I was staying at the W in the FiDi and was guided here based on the recommendation from the concierge after we asked for a low key place to grab a quiet dinner with a colleague.<br><br>It ended up being more high end than I was expecting and quite a nice setting. Since we did not have a reservation, we were seated by the open kitchen in a bar setting which actually ended up being the best spot in the restaurant since we got dinner and a &#34;show&#34; by watching the kitchen at work.<br><br>We recognized Floyd Cardozo from Tabla in the kitchen. That explains the Indian flavor in the chicken soup which was really good. The rib eye unfortunately was thoroughly disappointing. It was way too fatty and tough and I ended up only eating like a fourth of it. I had the butterscotch pot de creme which was average. <br><br>Service was exceptional and our waitress was a sweetheart.	0
No. Food was EEHH the crappy service was why I really didn&#39;t like this place. It took our server forever to do anything. Never checked on us. He would come outside stare at us and our empty plates and then walk past us.<br><br>Had artichoke ravioli and it tasted nothing like artichokes. You get semi stale, from the grocery store bread before your meal as well. Mediocure. Skip this place.	0
Great service. Healthy options. Juices and salads. Reasonably priced. The redesign with the Delano rebranding is more organic. The chunky old stodgy chairs were replaced by simply chic wooden ones. Farm to table vibe.	1
Pros:<br>Superbock Portugese beer (bottle)<br><br>Cons:<br>Food was blah<br>Service was extremely rushed<br>Wait staff started cleaning with windex while we (and other diners) were still eating our meals<br>No one checked on us to see if we liked our food (after picking the waiter&#39;s recommendation)<br>Hardly anything authentic about their grilled meat - it was bland and flavorless<br><br>Not coming back.	0
IDEAL PLACE to eat there. Me and family had a chance today to eat food. We tried AFGHANI LAMB LAMB FALAFEL AND PAD THAI These food are very delicious off course mouth watering. 	1
THIS IS MY FAVORITE COLOMBIAN HAWTDAWG PLACE EVER. <br><br>The beautiful thing about Mao&#39;s is that they drench EVERYTHING in SAUCE. I LOVE SAUCE. If you LOVE sauce, you&#39;d love this place. If you prefer to savor hotdog meat, then maybe you won&#39;t like it much. I personally find hotdog meat kind of disgusting. I prefer burger meat. But the anatomical structure of a hotdog in a bun creates a perfect cradle for all that delicious sauce. <br><br>Their other stuff is good, too. Like the corn stuff. But nothing tops the hotdogs.<br><br>Also! It&#39;s open late as fuhhh. By far my favorite thing to eat when I have late night munchies. <br><br>Four stars because the service suck! Some of their servers can go politely suck the fattest perro Colombiano they can find!	1
It is so true when they say that the dingiest and ugliest places make the best food. And this applies here, no offense to any Beehive employees or owners. I have to admit, it&#39;s not the most beautiful place and it is a bit intimidating to enter at first.<br><br>But if you can tough it up and push your way through all the healthy all natural stuff for sale, you&#39;ll find yourself perching yourself up on one of the few barstools in the back of the store. There you&#39;ll find the eccentric chef gladly eager to start a conversation. <br><br>You can choose for him to make you something off the menu and a fresh juice as well. Or you can eat one of the daily specials (which I&#39;ve heard is never the same and depends on his mood of the day). The empanadas are to die-for, literally. Ok maybe not. But they are really THAT good. As well as the fresh squeezed apple juice. I swear 99.9999% of America really doesn&#39;t know what REAL apple juice tastes like until you&#39;ve been here.	1
Not baaad.That's all I gotta say. I got the seafood taco lunch box deal, a shrimp and fish taco with a drink and side of rice and beans all for $9 and some change. Prices are reasonable and service is great. The place looks cool too. The tacos were just alright to me. Nothing amazing but not bad either. I would come back.	1
1st timer to Aussie meat pies and not really being a fan of pot pies (that&#39;s what I had imagined it to be), I was glad to find that it is much tastier. <br><br>We had the ground beef &amp; chunky beef meat pies. Both were flavorful though I preferred the ground. I liked that the crust/she&#39;ll wasn&#39;t thick &amp; doughy. It was light &amp; flaky. <br><br>If it had a beefier flavor (hard to express) I would have given it 5 stars. Overall though, it was very good. <br><br>I&#39;d like to come back to try their lamb &amp; dessert pies.	1
First three times were fabulous. Most recently the service was horrible and the food was fair. When the owner asked how our dinner was, I told the truth. His response: we were busy tonight. Probably not so in the future.	0
After Drive ins Diners and Dives.. I found that I was passing this place almost every week. I grabbed one of my buddies and made plans to stop for lunch. Being New Mexico Native I had to try the NM Chili Verde (Green chili with pork)	0
FINALLY on my FOURTH attempt to try this place, I was able to try this place. -1st time: opps! Came on a Tuesday. They're closed on Tuesday. -2nd time: Had our name on the list, but was turned away because it was going to be 3pm after waiting over 30 minutes.-3rd time: Their list was "closed" already. -4th time: Came 30 minutes after they opened and had to wait about 30 minutes to be seated. But alas! I was finally seated!! VICTORY!I got the cha shu ramen. Edgar G. got the salmon don with ramen thing. Waited about 15 minutes for our food to arrive. We asked for more wasabi and was given a dime amount. *hmm... ok?* Then we dig into our bowls of ramen. I noticed I barely had any green onions, which was good because I usually scoop it out anyway. I probably had about 6 thinly sliced pieces of cha shu *hmmm...* and not one but TWO bamboo shoots! TWO! Not a couple... just TWO! wow! Edgar G. also asked for cha shu in his ramen though I'm not sure how much they gave him. Our bill comes and just for ramen and the extra cha shu our total came out to about $25. $2 for the extra cha shu. I don't know what all the hype is about this place and why people wait so long just to eat here, but this place is sooooooooooo skimpy with EVERYTHING and their ramen isn't even all that cheap! Well, it took me FOUR tries to figure this out. Sorry Suzu, I don't think I'll be returning any time soon.	0
The service was quick, I had the Bowery burger customized to my liking. I enjoyed the music selection and my waitress was cool. Nice energy and prepped me for my allergies so I was able to watch out for my harmful reaction Will definitely be back	1
There is nothing special about this place and it&#39;s certainly doesn&#39;t deserve 4 stars. The food was very disappointing. We won&#39;t come back.<br>&#39;	0
I don't care what any of the other reviews say, this is my favorite after bar food in the area. Ive had the Manhandler, mac and cheese balls, grilled cheese, big dog thing, breakfast burrito, BLT, brownie sunday, and all were just fine. I mean what tastes like gourmet food after 10 drinks anyway? It gets crowded. Service is definitely lacking, but the people watching is fun and the greasy food hits the spot. You can't drink on the patio though and that sucks, but I probably didn't need another drink anyway.	1
This was my first time to Jimmy's and the service, atmosphere although noisy and food was great.  I made my reservations on line a week prior to arrival date and it was the best decision to make.  When I got there it was crowded and folks were waiting for tables.   I just gave my name and my table was ready in less than 3 minutes; and this was on a Friday evening.  Once we were seated, I figured because it is Restaurant Week and the place is crowded, we would have to wait a while before giving our order.  Wrong!  Our waiter was there within minutes to take our order.  The wait time for drinks, soup and salad was very minimal.  By the time we had finished consuming our first courses, the main dishes arrived and to my surprise, our plates were loaded.  I got the crab cake dinner and it was absolutely &quot;yummy delicious&quot;.  Jumbo lump crabmeat with very little fillers.  Other members within my party got the NY Strip and crab cake and the chicken parmesan.  All I can say is &quot;wow&quot;.  The greeters and wait staff are very friendly and accommodating which makes a very good first impression before you even get to the food.  I definitely plan on coming back and have already told several of my friends who can't wait to try it out.	0
I've been to Bluephies only a couple of times, but the meals both times were very good. The menu has a broad enough range of items so that most people you dine with will like something. Many of the items are very imaginative, but there are also popular standbys as well.	0
First time experience (take-out) was totally satisfying. The Casanova Roll was superb.	1
I just noticed tonight that they put 15% service charge on the bill, add that with your bill, THEN tax you on that subtotal amount.<br><br>Why are you charging me tax on the service charge?????<br><br>Ridiculous!	0
This was my 1st of three stops in search of decent Cuban food on mothers day this year. This place came in second ahead of Mojitos (I&#39;m not sure if that should be considered a compliment). The food was OK. I ordered a Ropa vieja and so did my friend. We were both so very disappointed. It&#39;s Cuban food for goodness sake you should try to add some flavor, salt, adobo idk something. I digress, the drinks were not that great. It tasted like water and alcohol...all of them eww. Will I come back. Nope not ever. Oh yeah before I forget where was our waiter???	0
Such a fantastic place to eat. Great to order in waves. I would suggest the carrots, radishes ( and I usually don't really like radishes) to start. Followed by the collard greens and kimchi- that was my favorite dish. I would skip the salads- not that amazing. Finish with the clams and a burger- both of those were so expertly executed. Also so many new flavors- Roy choi is kind of genius. Drinks are meh and a bit inconsistent. The pomegranate beverage tasted different and came with different garnishes everytime someone in my party ordered them- also they sell out of them quickly as well. Service is fantastic. We waited less then 30 mins ( the wait at pot was 1 hours and 45 minutes) and our server was super knowledgable and helpful. Can't wait to go back.	1
The venue is good and the food was good but a bit overpriced for the quality of the food.  Service was mediocre considering the prices.	1
I had the steak and egg breakfast. The steak was overdone with no seasoning and it had an odd liver-like aftertaste. My son had pancakes which were underdone and quite flavorless. The coffee was watery and hard to come by and I hate to say it but the waitress was fairly forgetful. I will not dine there again. I had previously (recently) dined there for dinner and was not impressed but wanted to give breakfast a try.	0
I went there yesterday and it was awful there were a lot of people waiting, horrible service... one of guy there started to be rude just because we didn&#39;t understand him when he asked about which kind of tortilla we wanted....Tacos are good I mean like real Mexican ones but not so spacial for wait 30 min for your food and horrible costumer service.	0
Get ready to spend atleast $25 for a meal here. And MORE if you want beers ($7+) That puts Badmaash out of my &#34;OOOh I can eat here once a week!&#34; bracket and into my &#34;I really really really need to want this more than some other $25 meal&#34; bracket.<br><br>The food is great but the prices seem a little unreasonable. Why are you going to charge $3 for a bowl of rice. It would be like restaurants charging for bread and butter. Maybe it&#39;s cultural. I&#39;m Korean and every Korean restaurant gives rice, freeee rice, with your dish since you need rice to eat your dish. Would make sense with curry since you can&#39;t eat curry on it&#39;s own. Would it kill you to include rice since we&#39;re already spending $14 for a little bowl of curry? Instead of making my curry meal nearly $20?<br><br>We ordered the tandoori shrimp. It was $16. It came with 6 shrimp. Sdfjasdlf? Value? Where? We also had the lamb vindaloo, butter chicken, chicken tikka masala and several helpings of nan. I love spicy food and the lamb was very good but I couldn&#39;t help but compare this place to other Indian restaurants I&#39;ve been to and question the price differences.<br><br>I love Indian food and Indian culture. I spent some time in India so I&#39;ve had my fair share of Indian food. The food at Badmaash is very good! But not good enough. I get when restaurants charge more for using better ingredients (local produce, grass-fed animals, etc) and I&#39;m happy to pay for it... but what irks me is when &#34;hip&#34; restaurants charge more just because everything LOOKS and FEELS hipper.<br><br>It&#39;s also crazy to me that this is considered a &#34;gastropub&#34; when they have NO BEERS ON TAP. I&#39;m going to say it again. NO BEERS ON TAP!?!<br><br>Also everyone is harping on how amazing the service is. Half of the wait staff were standing around on a busy friday night and I kid you not, three of the girls swooned at a guy (I admit he was quite dreamy) who said &#34;bye&#34; to them as he was leaving the restaurant and started giggling and gossiping like I was back in jr. high. I can&#39;t lie... as an observer, I was quite entertained, but really? So unprofessional. Also one of the waitresses or hostess ? came to drop off our food and I asked if they had hot sauce and her response was, &#34;You can ask your waiter&#34;.... Oh ok, thanks for that info I&#39;ll go ahead and do that since you&#39;re a lazyass.<br><br>Meters in the area stop at 8pm and are 1-2 hour parking before then. A few doors down from Edison lounge but nix that. Who feels sexy when their breath is currified?	0
I want to like this place so bad, but after tonight I will never be returning. First of all, I ordered ONE burritto and it took 30 minutes. On top of that it was $10, which doesnt bother me except for the fact that i waited 30 MINUTES. Who ever is running this restaurant has never taken a course in operations. The have two girls working one cash register (when there are two of them), a huge line to order. Their chefs not only are preparing the food BUT they then have to walk the dishes out to the tables to serve the food, which completely slows down the whole joint. Again, this is all happened while two girls work the cash register- when the spare girl should have also been serving the food. Anyways, great food, TERRIBLE TERRIBLE service. So bad that I wont be returning and dont think anyone else should either.	0
The food was excellent although very expensive. The steaks were not accompanied by any sides. We ordered several sides to share and the portions were small for  sharing. Our waiter kept taking plates away before everyone was finished eating making us feel rushed. The restaurant was empty when we arrived and never completely filled up. In spite if this we had a very enjoyable time and the food including dessert was excellent. I would go back.	1
This used to be my favorite burger joint.. That is until they changed their fries. Can someone please explain why? Was it to cut costs? If it was I know a heap of people who wouldn&#39;t buy the fries because quite frankly they taste like crap. So there goes some of your sales shake shack.<br>Your crinkle fries were so good and set you apart from all the other burger places in New York. If you were going to make the change at least do it for the better. Not to replace them with soggy, tasteless run of the mill fries.<br><br>I&#39;ll also say that the girl at the register didn&#39;t smile/say hello or barely acknowledged us. When the burger came out they didn&#39;t have onion like I&#39;d asked and the wrong one had pickle on it. Also mine looked like it had been squashed. QUALITY SLIPPING PEOPLE!<br>Shame on you shake shack for being so cheap. You&#39;ve lost a customer and I guarantee I&#39;m not the first..	0
I used to love this place a few years back, but over time I felt the quality of the food drop dramatically. The food just didn&#39;t taste as good. The three most recent times I have eaten here, I ended up with an upset stomach, so I&#39;ve given it up for redemption.	0
I want to really love this place. The food is really just lovely. We came here for brunch.	1
I was a bit dissapointed....I second what someone said about the hanger steak, it was incredibly tough and had an odd almost metallic taste to it. That being said the cornmeal pancakes and arugula salad were excellent, so I&#39;ll go back, try something else, and give it another shot.	0
Spicy shrimp soup is hands down the best soup in this restaurant.I don't recommend coconut soup.I love the ambience, price, and friendly service.All the staffs i met were friendly.Parking may be inconvenient as it fills up quickly, but at least you don't pay for valet parking.You may have to drive around a block and find a street parking.	1
Blend abalone porridge. Quality went down? Maybe when magazines give good review this place, they put extra crack or something that normal customer don't get. Grumpy ajummas need vacation days and rest! They are not the friendliest....	0
it is in mandalay bay las vegas.  it was great. Had an awesome time.	1
Highly recommended! <br><br>Not much room to sit unless you are just popping in for a quick bite at their counter, but a lovely delivery and take out option. <br><br>Food tastes very fresh and not previously frozen. The dumplings are super good - with a thin enough skin and a variety of pork, seafood (mmm shrimp and garlic chive) and veggie options. The sauces show a good amount of care, with cilantro, chili and scallion added to the standard clear dipping sauce. Prices are very fair for most dishes - those used to ban mi sandwiches from Chinatown might notice they are a few dollars more than their Southern neighbors, but the appetizers and other dishes fit right in with neighborhood prices. <br><br>Also they have delicious bubble tea, a major bonus. <br><br>All in all, a tasty addition to the neighborhood and quality delivery option.	1
Good Food, NOT Cuban	1
The worst italian food we have ever had! I ordered farfalle primavera. it was tasteless and bland. Pasta were floating in a white sauce that had a bad taste. My friend has spaghetti carbonara. Same scenario here... Spaghetti were soaking in a milky sauce and it was tasteless... So disappointing!!!!	0
Best pork chop I've ever had	1
This place was good, but not super memorable. You'll want to order well in advance if you are doing pickup or delivery since it takes a long time to get your food. I've never eaten at the restaurant itself.	0
It&#39;s over. The masses have ruined this place thanks to an over abundance of press. When the line spills out the door and stretches down the sidewalk (even on weekdays) and the espresso drinks take longer than the fried eggs, it&#39;s no longer worth it. If you&#39;re an early bird then go for it, you&#39;ll probably be fine.	0
I dined alone and had great food, kind service and a wonderful overall expereince.	0
REALLY CHEAP place for drinks and thai food in SF.some cons,- food is MEDIOCRE, probably the worst thai food i've gone back to after the first try (you really get what you pay for...)- service sucks -- they always forget to bring you things you ask for; their english is minimal for ordering; THEY CAN'T DEAL WITH BIG CROWDS. (it took 30 minutes for them to bring a bucket of beer. HOW HARD IS IT TO OPEN 5 BOTTLES AND PLACE IT IN A BUCKET?)- not good for big groups! (they always mess up the orders and try to charge for extra things)BUT STILL. REALLY, REALLY CHEAP DRINKS.	0
So not alot of restaurants serve Chazuke, it's sort of a homestyle thing but i really like it, and despite being able to buy the chazuke mix at places like nijiya, it never comes out quite as well as i'd like.This being said Oomasa serves chazuke, which if you don't know is rice in a soup made of green tea, seaweed, and bits of salmon or pickles on top, and it is really pretty awesome. If you've never had it, go to Oomasa and get it, esp if you're not feeling well since it always makes me feel better.	1
Great bar for a low key night with a group of friends. Head straight to the backyard for that chill Brooklyn ambiance. <br>Pros:<br>- cute rustic decor<br>- very affordable (had a burger for $12, sangria for $8, they had specials going on like a shot &amp; a beer for $6)<br>- great food<br>- you can very well hear each other even on a Saturday night, which not many bars offer<br>- also on a sat night it was not extremely packed, which made the experience a lot more pleasant<br>Cons:<br>- the only thing I wasn&#39;t a fan of is that there&#39;s no waiter service - you have to go to the bar every time you want to order something.<br>Overall, very much recommended!	1
This is for the Dells location which didn't come up on Yelp but I'm sure it would be the same review anyway...so would you think Devil's Spit BBQ sauce would be spicy? You'd be wrong here....no heat just endless sugar and salt...even the broccoli!	0
Cute upscale neighborhood restaurant that serves up a cornbread with maple butter that is essentially like starting out your meal with a cake. I highly recommend ordering this for the table the minute you get seated. So.freaking.good. <br><br>Cornbread aside, their menu offers up something for everyone - salads, burgers, sandwiches, and meat from their rotisserie. The veal brisket stroganoff won the contest on a cold night, and was rich and satisfying. <br><br>So, for your cold winter pre-Jeni&#39;s nights (because you can still eat Jeni&#39;s in the winter time - YES YOU CAN), come here for some comforting dinner. Sit close by (but no by) the fireplace (or you&#39;ll roast), and you can have a cozy Southport Corridor dinner, complete with all the families and children surroundings that you could possibly want, and cornbread in a skillet that will chase away all your winter blues.	1
I have to say, I was a bit dissapointed in the place, reading all the good reviews. I know now why people wait 2 hours to eat Boilng Crab.. their quality of food is just better. Thw shrimp was fine.. BUT, the crawfish wasn't fresh.. I'm sure it was frozen and over cooked.. they were mushy , broken and the tails were a bit rubbery, discolored and tasted super fishy. We also ordered the fried catfish basket.. it was ok at best.. Boiling Crabs version just tastes fresher. I WILL however give this place credit, as you can bring your own booze! I thought that was cool. I'd come back if I didn't want to wait for boiling crab and maybe if I was just gonna order shrimp... at best, I give this place a C+.	0
i can't think of a better setting for a dinner date or special occasion. we enjoyed an intimate dinner with friends to celebrate their recent engagement. the bf made reservations for a table outside in the "tree house." the food was superb! for starters, we shared a few appetizer specials including the roasted quail, grilled lamb chops over arugula (absolutely delicious), and haricot verts salad with fresh figs, and we also ordered the ahi tuna tartare with wonton crisp. for entrees, the bf and i shared my favorite fish -- barramundi and it was prepared perfectly. as for dessert, we sampled the flourless chocolate cake (the favorite among the men at our table), the chocolate pot de creme (my favorite), and the red velvet cake (the bride-to-be's favorite).service was a bit spotty but it could also be due to the 45 cancellations they received as a result of the sunset junction street festival this weekend. the road in front of the valet parking lot to the restaurant was blocked. i would definitely come back for dinner or even grab a drink at the bar.	1
Hands down this place has the best gyros and Greek fries I ever had! My family and I enjoyed the whole dining experiences with great food and top notch service at Bellas and we can't wait to be back!	1
Good food, nice atmosphere, friendly service, reasonably priced and plenty of parking.  Also good wine and delicious martini!  The place was hopping for a Tuesday night!	1
I hope this was an aberration. The building was cool and the idea behind the name (all ingredients sourced from within 360 miles) is excellent, but the execution was awful. Reservation was forgotten and we had to wait for them to figure out how to seat us. The host was pleasant and apologetic though, so we moved on. The server was indifferent at best. After taking orders, including a request for PLAIN yogurt (without the honey and fruit) to come out right away for my ten month old, noting came for twenty minutes. When food did come, only four of the seven meals arrived and one was Ice cold eggs. The yogurts took another ten minutes and arrived with honey and fruit mixed in- Forgetting that having honey could make a less than one year old very ill, my five year old does not like berries and we wanted to limit her honey intake, didn't feel like an extraordinary request. The returned eggs and another egg dish did not arrive until the other three diners were done and when they did, there was hardly any egg to speak of in the scrambler. The yogurts never came back right and we were then told that the chef is unwilling to change his yogurt creation because then it would no longer be his/her designed dish.	1
So we are basically forced to order another round of drinks AND leave this place because someone else has been waiting for the same table. A hundred dollars well spent.	0
Great little hole in the wall, delicious hot food! Only negative it&#39;s a very small restaurant feels like you can reach in someone else&#39;s plate you&#39;re that close.	1
Good food.	1
The food is amazing, the prices are very reasonable, the service is as friendly as it gets, and the ambiance is beautiful- especially the outdoor patio. A wonderful place for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, with a perfect blend of Mexican and American foods on the menu. The New York strip steak (my favorite) is so tender that I could easily cut it with a butter knife. I highly recommend this restaurant!!!	1
I have been to this restaurant several times and had a very good dining experience however, this time I made a late reservation 10:45 PM due to a late flight. The filet steak seemed as if it was more microwaved tthen grilled and was underooked. The sides were good as was the wine but since the core part of the meal was sub par  it was disappointing especially considering the cost of dining at the Capital Grille.	1
Mediocre food<br>Waitress with major attitude<br>$25 cutting fee for a cake<br><br>Me...think...not...	0
Love this place! The food was great.The service was excellent. The place felt like we were Somewhere in Italy. Can&#39;t wait to eat here again.	1
A friend of mine recommended this place and I am glad she did. We enjoyed the challenge of finding it after taking a stroll through Pike's Market. We walked in and sat at the bar for drinks. From the bar, you could watch the cooks working, which we really enjoyed. The drinks were innovative and tasty. The servers were knowledgeable of both the beverage and food menus. They were also flexible in helping us make reservations. We were only in town for two days, so we were able to make a reservation the same day we found Radiator Whiskey, but we really wanted to order a pig head, which you have to pre- order. The staff was flexible in helping us change the reservation. Unfortunately, they checked again and found that all the pig head for the next evening was also pre-ordered (they only make 3/night, so if you want one, be sure to pre-order in advance...this is the main reason I've docked my review by 1 star).	1
The cuts of meat are brilliant and the  service staff is very attentive and prompt. I will definitely come back again!	1
Good food!	1
Relaxed atmosphere, great beer selection, downtown arts district, what more do you need. Great place for a pre night out beverage or to just chill with the mates and kill a few pints.	1
This is not the place to be in a hurry at. Go with time, and all will be good. I tried the Shanghai Salad, and that was delicious! The iced coffee was also exceptional. It's only a couple blocks away, and there are plenty of items that are calling my name from the menu, so I'll be back soon!	1
Blue Agave has the perfect atmosphere. Amazing food and great service as well!!!	0
Delicious healthy food, nice decor and location and the service is really friendly. Love it!	1
Paid $30 dollars for sucky cold burned taquitos, a California burrito that was all tortilla and room temperature, a side of chips &amp; salsa with a ton of chips and a condiment side of salsa, and a &#34;medium horchata with extra ice&#34; that came with no ice. Such a rip off.	0
Best. Brunch. In. Town.	0
Great matcha green tea lattes! The best I've had	1
BEAUTIFUL view at night of DTLA! i take my friends here all the time!excellent food! love the atmosphere....love the french theme and cuisine...classy...jazzy!my fave rooftop lounge/restaurant in all of l.a.!	1
Overpriced and underwhelming! Really...4 small ricotta raviolis for $16, and it&#39;s called the dinner special? That is just rude. Also they pour the smallest glass of wine I&#39;ve seen and then charge $14. I love to go out to eat and never mind spending money, this just felt like one big opportunity to take advantage of people. Disappointed party of 4 and none of us are going back!	0
Ugh. Cesspool of a college bar, the only place at which I was ever, as far as I can tell, overtly discriminated against on the basis of (perceived) sexual orientation.	0
I had this place on my list for over a year but finally tried it out and will never go back again. I went there sober on a Saturday night around 10 pm and was one there in addition to a couple who seemed to know the waiter pretty well. The (asian) customer dude was picking at his toes in the booth. Is bimbimbap bimbimbap without the stone bowl? I'm not sure but this is the only place I've been to where it was served in a plastic bowl. There wasn't much flavor and the beef seemed to be low quality. The veggies and rice were mediocrely warm. It seemed more like a bunch of fried rice ingredients lazily placed into a bowl.Also had the garlic chicken which had way too much batter and the chicken was overcooked.I was the oldest guy there and I'm not even that old.The service was great but the food just plain sucks.The place did fill up with a bunch of young Korean hipster douchebags when I was halfway through my meal.---Redwings has higher quality food at similar pricing.	0
Cafecito...I wanted to like you so much that I ate here again after a very mediocre first experience. I tried two sandwiches: the Cubano (recommended by the cashier) and the Guava BBQ. Both times I was disappointed. The Cubano was good, but just ok. I could&#39;ve gotten the same thing anywhere else. The Guava BBQ was slathered in so much sauce that it was truly overwhelming. The meat was also nothing but fat. I was disgusted eating it. <br><br>The cortadito was ok, but I wouldn&#39;t come back for it. The cafe con leche was extremely good. I don&#39;t think I&#39;d go out of my way to come back just for the cafe con leche, but if I was in the area I&#39;d definitely stop by and grab one. But only the cafe con leche.	0
Very average. We came in here, hopeful that this place would satiate our Korean food cravings, but unfortunately it left us still wanting. We ordered the Ginger Brussell Sprouts (too oily), the KFC (eh, can&#39;t compare to my beloved BonChon!), the Bulgogi Bowl (very meh, the beef looked so lonely on top of the rice), and the Bo Ssam (which was ok, but the kim chee that was next to it was pale and sad, not flavorful like I wanted). <br><br>Don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be coming back. The servers were nice, though.	0
I am SO freakin glad that this place is open on Sundays now.....I&#39;m always at Mosaic for church on Sundays, and we were getting tired of the handful of places we could go to within walking distance. <br><br>This place is D-lish!! Everything is good. EVERYTHING. I haven&#39;t had anything that I didn&#39;t like. The spicy ramen is my fav. <br><br>The only reason I didn&#39;t give it 5 stars is because the decor and ambiance is only average, and it&#39;s not a place to bring huge groups. But for a nice meal between close friends that&#39;s not stuffy or pricey but home-cookin&#39;-satisfying, this is the place.	1
Food was good. I really enjoyed the drinks. My problem was that the waiter tells my friend, "we work off tips here." This happens as we buy our first round of tacos and beer! That comment really had an experience on our group.	0
The services is horrible. I went today, my boyfriend and I were waiting for 10 minutes for someone to come to the table. Finally, Sarah came to the table. Really bad!	0
Seattles favorite sandwich hands down.	1
Waited over 40 mins for our food. When it came out it was missing my order! Only my boyfriend got his food, which was a fried chicken sandwich and i was left waiting for my warm goat chees argula salad. after a few minutes i had to walk up to the register to ask where my food was, and i could see the hadn&#39;t even started it on it! ok whatever i decided i didn&#39;t even want it anymore, and told the cashier to cancel the order and he gave me a freaking attitude about it! Saying &#34; well i already put the order in and you already paid for so i can&#39;t cancel it&#34; Are you freaking stupid? what the heck kind of customer service is that, he never apologized or seemed even slightly concerned that we waited so long in a not crowded restaurant and that my food never came out. Long story short i had them change my order to a fried chicken salad and it sucked. Wont be going back there.<br>side note: my BF really liked his fried chicken sandwich and didn&#39;t mind the wait because he wasn&#39;t really hungry to begin with, maybe he will write them a better review.	0
Was looking for a place that served Dominican food and this hit the spot. So yummy and affordable. I got the roasted pork and my friend got the shrimp. So delicious! Also I love the little mama/auntie who works there. She was so cute and kind to us and we felt immediately at home. Love that this is a family operation. Also one of my favorite thing is the pickled onions they serve with the entrees...so delicious!!!	1
During the summer, I go to the Dane twice a week or more. This has more to do with them being a sponsor of MUFA (Madison Ultimate Frisbee Association) leagues than anything, but off season, I go nearly once a month. The food is great, the service usually stellar, and the beer is the best in Madison. Try Potters Run and Texas Speedbump for pale ale's , the Stone of Scone scotch ale is spectacular, and if you like wheat beer, the Crop Circle must be okay, since even I will drink it. Summertime will give a selection of fruit beers, which I don't consider beer, but if you dig that sort of thing you'll be good to go! Overall, it's a great place to be, and I definitely recommend the garden during late spring, early summer unless it rained in the last 24 hours, as the garbage from the restaurant next door can get a bit rank. If you want to eat right away, avoid Fridays and Saturdays after 7:00, you won't get a table until around 8:00.	1
Had tokatsu ramen and spicy miso ramen with side of gyoza and egg roll... Service was fast as was the food... Tasty broth and very filling... Good for a quick and easy meal	1
Delicious dishes (heirloom tomatoes; market veggies with ricotta; malt ice cream sundae); but dollhouse-size portions; and the beer selection was odd. I personally didn't think it lived up to all the hype: the waitress was not attentive to our table, or knowledgeable about the menu. Also the sour beers -- their beer menu is currently featuring ONLY sour beers -- were just plain weird. A little sour sounded interesting, (or maybe the waitress had meant to say hoppy/bitter? we wondered), but these beers were actually sour with an aftertaste of apple cider vinegar. Whose bad idea was that?! A fun experience, but for that kind of money-- well, I'd rather save my money and splurge at l'Etoile.	0
To be clear, I&#39;ve visited Forage several times over the past six months. At times (well, mostly past visits), the food has been gourmet excellent, which is to say I honestly felt that at times Forage rivaled the top dining venues in the city. But, I digress. Food alone does not spell a dining experience. There is the fluid concept of atmosphere, service, presentation and many other intangibles to consider. My main beef, pardon the pun, is with the demeanor of service. <br><br>Cheap-Out on Portions <br>================================ <br>On food alone, at least over the whole of my dining experience, Forage would receive a 4.5 or even 5. As we have it, though, I&#39;ve grown tired of dealing with tattooed, hemp wearing servers who cheap out on portions and expect you to love them! So that alone takes them down to a four. <br><br>Overcharging and Weighing Meat <br>================================ <br>What takes them down to a three is the shrinking size of the containers coupled with outrageous prices and ... the OVERCHARGING. Okay, it&#39;s 50 cents, but it&#39;s still OVERCHARGING. The big chalkboard says that two sides of &#39;greens&#39; and a &#39;protein&#39; will be $11.50, and almost every single time I&#39;ve ordered the food to go I&#39;ve been charged for the items separately, which adds to $12.00. Now being OVERCHARGED is one thing, but then having to deal with being OVERCHARGED for shrinking portions is another. Forage, like other establishments it appears to seek to mimic (Boston Market obviously comes to mind), has instituted a policy of weighing portions. This is on top of recently and very visibly, I might add, reducing the size of their to-go containers. Except, they try to hide it, unlike Boston Market. The SCALE IS HIDDEN BEHIND THE COUNTER under a shelf, so when you see your service attendant dilly-dallying with meat, they are trying to weigh it. My guess is they never go over some number but always under. (It would be hard to size meat portions just right enough to get an even-numbered value.) So the customer gets a half-full container that is barely a shadow of what they ordered. To put the container size in better perspective, it&#39;s maybe just a bit bigger than the size of a baby food jar. <br><br>Then, what takes them down to two, is simply being stupid and arrogant. WEIGHING FOOD SERVINGS? REDUCING PORTIONS. They are on a severe flame-out trip. <br><br>C&#39;est la vie. Great things, nary good things, cannot last forever.	0
What a spot! They have a great selection of craft brews and food was tasteful. Friendly bartender and music was jamming. Will definitely come here again. Cheers	1
With the addition of Saffron, Bunker Hill finally has a great Indian option to work into the take-out lunch rotation. The food and pricing seem identical to that served at Saffron in the City National Plaza -- but without the schlep three whole blocks from Bunker Hill.<br><br>I recommend a combination with chicken tikka and saag paneer. Only the white rice is basmati (the brown rice is just regular brown rice), so the rice selection is a no brainier.	1
On my quest to find good Italian food in LA...Came to Little Dom's early on a Saturday night, and the place was already hopping! Good thing we had a reservation. Food was good. Ordered the brussel sprouts w/ boar bacon, and now I'm a believer in the power of a good brussel sprout. We also had the spaghetti & meatballs and the margherita pizza which were both good. The food and atmosphere was good but the tables were very small and the menu seemed kind of limited to me... Things were good, but not mind-blowing.	1
I'm surprised that I hadn't been to Franklin & Co. sooner, having lived close by and frequented other places in Franklin Village for over a year. Despite it being a very small space, it was a great dining experience. On a whim, a group of six of us walked in around 9:30pm on a Saturday night and we were able to sit at the long, farmhouse-style table & benches upstairs. Sitting up there was actually preferable to downstairs, where the tables were pretty cramped unless you were sitting outside. We ordered drinks, dinner and dessert, all of which was amazing. I ordered an Eastside cocktail ($11) that was made perfectly, and the table ordered salads, the duck-fat waffle fries and the baked mac n' cheese. The best thing by far was the chocolate caramel brownie cake that we shared! It was so delicious. The service was a bit slow but we could see how busy it was downstairs and it was obviously more difficult to catch a server to ask for more water, the check, etc. This is definitely a trendy spot, and more of a bar scene than a relaxing restaurant, but we'd definitely come back for the food!	1
I was excited to try this place out for brunch on the weekend. While the service was adequate and the atmosphere pleasant, the food left something to be desired. I purposely didn't order the buffet, because I wanted fresh(er) food. My plan didn't work. As my dining companion said, "Everything feels like it has been sitting under a heat lamp." I couldn't get through my generous portion of tired bacon.	0
We were skeptical about food quality since we heard about the over the top creative presentation of the food. But food was equally delicious!! Party of 5 dined there on NY Eve and we all loved it. Our server Alycia was awesome and super attentive with all the other servers and food runners pitching in so all food was served and cleared efficiently. The following were awesome: popcorn shrimpLobster mac and cheeseLamb shank Cod fish Steaks Bread donuts It is a bit pricey but with it ! We will be back for sure	1
Tried it for the first time after hearing many people brag about it. Has it's ups and downs like every place. I had the SoCal Burger (the closest thing to a traditional burger) +Juicy fat beef+flavorful + you know a burger is good when a neat eater eats something sloppy! overall, it was amazing, very mouth watering and mouth orgasmic! negatives: - small! REALLY SMALL, size of a palm ( I have a small palm) for 10$'s? -no bbq sauce! :( I love bbq sauce lol worth going again :)	1
A nice surprise.As you can see from my previous review, I only popped into this place when Yelp hosted part of Sunset Junction's VIP lounge a few years back. I thought it was a cool place on the whole, but it never really jumped out as a place to go back to in a quick minute.But then the other night, while zipping through Yelp to find steak on the east side, this place popped up and my friends and I decided to give it a try again. When we walked in I had forgotten how beautiful it is inside. Perfect for a nice warm LA night or even a crisp cool one since they have heat lamps all over the place.We ordered a nice bottle of wine per our server's suggestion and ordered the calamari and a round of steaks with Gorgonzola and this au gratin potato thing. The steak was prepared perfectly, but I am still a bit confused by the random chunks of Gorgonzola on top of it. I was imagining some sort of sauce, not chunks. Weird. The potato thing however, was in the category of crack. Soooo amazing and almost tasted like a crispy mac n cheese with truffle oil thrown in for good measure. Definitely worth licking the plate for :)Overall, I had a really nice time here. The service was good and even though she initially forgot to put our app in when we ordered it, when we asked about it she came totally clean and went, "Doh! I'm so sorry, let me go put that in right away!!" I respect that, just be honest, I can handle it :) I would definitely return again if I was in the neighborhood :)	1
This place is first class all the way. First off, I did want to mention Stark's bar which is outdoors and right outside the restaurant. It is a cool modern vibe (of course since it is at LACMA) and so is Ray's. We were seated at a corner table and that's when the fun began.The silverware is in a drawer in your table. So cool!! Our server was extremely knowledgeable and his service was great. Answered all of our questions but not too snooty. The attentiveness was at the right level.We got the Chile and Corn pasta as an appetizer. The pasta was surprisingly sweet and delicious. The Chile was okay for me but my wife loved it! For my entree, I had the hanger steak which was cooked to perfection at medium rare. The vegetables were also perfect and the sauce was heaven. I still don't know what was in it, but it hit all the right taste buds. I don' go into much further detail since the menu constantly changes but they used all locally sourced and organics ingredients.HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!	1
This dinner was not as good as the terrific experiences in the past have been. Although a specific table area was requested in the OpenTable reservation, and some decent tables in that area were available, our party of 4 was initially squeezed around a small round table. Within milliseconds, it was clear that this would be miserable, and we asked the hostess for another table - no party of 4 should ever be seated there. We were give a table a little further from the area initially requested, again despite the availability of tables in the area asked for,  but at least there was adequate room for 4 people. Service was neither speedy nor attentive.  I ordered a round of drinks, and they came back completely wrong. Dinner was fine. It is important for diners to note that for the wines on tap, a 'carafe' is only 0.375 liter - half a bottle, which makes the wines on tap fairly pricey. I ordered a $ 55 carafe of a pinot, but when I realized it was only half a bottle, it made much more sense to order a very nice, unopened pinot at $ 123. The bottom line is that when the Beat opened, it got off to a very strong start and quickly became quite a popular place. However, if not managed carefully, early success can turn into complacency, or even arrogance, shortening the arc of of the business. I hope this less than spectacular, but nevertheless still fairly decent experience, was just the result of a couple of unrelated, unfortunate coincidences, and not reflective of taking success for granted. I didn't feel great about that experience, but I will go back hoping it was an anomaly. If not, I will let you know.	1
Yum! Service is fast and efficient, better than most sushi restaurants I've been to in California! I recommend the Lady Gaga & Fashion rolls! Best rolls my husband and I have ever had!	0
This place is awesome! Here is how you do it:<br>1. Is it winter? Is it cold? Do you need vegan comfort food?<br>2. Go to half acre down the street &amp; pick up beer (or cvs across the street if u have to)<br>3. Put 2 hrs in the meter if u drove<br>4. Order one of their delicious vegan casseroles<br>5. Sit back, slow down, drink beer, color with their crayons, relax<br>6. Enjoy their delicious comfort food in a warm cozy little place<br>...mmmmmm...dreaming of the tamale pie	1
Although I wasn&#39;t necessarily disappointed I wasn&#39;t overly &#34;wowed&#34; by Ocho Mexican Grill. Finally met a friend for lunch and he chose this establishment so we could have more time. Anyway, just like Chipotle it was assembly-line quickish. The problem is that I could not understand either of the two people who assembled my bowl...I just pointed or said what I wanted. I felt rushed and - as it was my first time, I wanted to understand what ingredients were available. <br><br>I had white rice, black beans, shredded chicken, a little cheese, cilantro and lettuce. I believe there was also pico de gallo and medium sauce involved. I dashed some tabasco sauce in it for a little more kick.<br><br>It really was just okay. I mean, the flavors were alright but my tastebuds didn&#39;t do the happy dance or scream &#34;More! More!&#34;<br><br>Will I go again? Probably. But more out of convenience to my friend&#39;s workplace than anything.	0
So i made a reservation, and when we arrived, I asked for a booth.  They put us in a booth next to a 08-00 top that was half children under 00 years old.  Not only were they disruptively noisy, but our waiter was also waiting on them and seemed to spend his entire time appeasing the.  Needless to say, it took a long time to order drinks, receive drinks, order apps, order dinner, get water refills and drink refills.  He entirely forgot my glass of wine with dinner.  The 2 old-fashioned cocktails I ordered, with had entirely too much cherry juice, and when I ordered the second one I asked for a second cherry, resulting in a drink with about 6 cherries.As for the food, it was a little off from what I've grown accustomed to expecting.  Ive had the shrimp cavatappi a few times before, and now I have no idea what its supposed to look or taste like...inconsistent.  In the past, it s had a light broth and was a little spicy.  Its also been  little thicker and spicy.  This evening, it was almost devoid of sauce or flavor.	0
The pretzel croissant doesn&#39;t appear that special at first, but it really does combine that distinct lye flavor with a a lighter flakier croissant. Yum.<br><br>The BeeSting cake here is more bready than other places. But the honey almond top keeps me eating this one.<br><br>The apple strudel has a wonderful duel personality crust. Shortbready on the bottom and flaky on top. Too bad its &#39;bakers canned apple filling&#39;, but unless they double the price of the strudel, this is perfectly understandable.	1
I love Alameda. I have been lazy about writing reviews, except in horrible encounters, but I&#39;m writing about Alameda because It&#39;s so great.<br><br>Short but well-curated/diverse list of beers on tap. Great craft cocktails (interesting ingredients and riffs on classics). Again, well-curated/edited wine list.<br><br>I&#39;ve eaten here 6+ times over the past 6 months, almost always on Sunday nights. My boyfriend LOVES the cheeseburger and fries. He said it&#39;s possibly the best burger he&#39;s had in NYC because it&#39;s simple and pared down- just juicy meat, a slice of Cheddar, and he puts mayo on the bun.<br><br>The boquerones, corn dish (summer seasonal), oysters, and trout have all been delicious. The first time we came for food, we had low expectations... but it was so delicious that we kept coming back. <br><br>One very consistent thing: the staff have always been AMAZINGLY attentive. Not intrusive, but always present, accommodating, and quick to bus table/bring drinks.<br><br>The lowdown: not for an anniversary dinner, but a great, casual, fun, delicious place to bring your friends, family, co-workers, ANYONE, and have a great time.	1
Simply put, you won't find a bar that has as wide and tasty a selection of custom micro brews in all of Madison - capital of American Beer country.	1
a hidden gem in dtla. the scene of dtla is beautiful here. can get a bit crowded at night but def. give this place a try if you want to go somewhere chill with your friends.	1
This was fun. Many different spaces to enjoy all in one bar. Oyster stout! Haven't seen it anywhere else.I just had drinks here, haven't tried the food. Doesn't matter - the atmosphere is perfect.	1
This place is excellent if you like old school, heavy Italian. Thick bread with olive oil. Rich goat cheese with veggies. Giant heavenly arancini. Baked heavenly pastas with savory marinara. Good North End spot.	1
Pure goodness.	1
Perhaps the hasty angel that left behind ONE KyoChon chicken wing for us mere mortals to recreate was the saint I shall now worship. I make the trip from the San Fernando just to satisfy my craving for that brief taste of heaven, and hell because with spice like that I can't tell if these are tears of Joy or pain, but I secretly like it. Service: excellent. Quick, efficient, friendly, and fluent.Food Quality: HeavenlyPresentation: Picturesque.	1
I am sorry but I seriously don't understand why people are giving this place four or five stars. The food was definitely not even a three stars for me. The service was super fast and I guess the servers were kinda friendly.My first impression of the place was actually really good. When we first walked in, we were greeted with a huge whiff of freshly grilled hamburger patties. It was a cute, little diner with very limited seating. Luckily only two people were there before us. There was no sign up sheet or anything. People just waited out of respect and courtesy. Although there were two ladies that tried to jack the seats before it was their turn. They were super rude and made it seem like they were there before us by standing really close to us and at one point, pushed my friend without saying sorry after!! That kinda ruined the mood for me but whatevs, people started leaving and seats opened up for us.We sat down and quickly made our decision of getting the Steak Burger and Hickory Burger with an order of fries. The fries came out immediately but unfortunately, they were not that great, and slightly burnt. The server asked if we wanted ketchup and dumped a third of the bottle onto a plate for us. I'm sorry but that was just wasteful!! Our hamburgers quickly came after. I was so excited to take the first bite of my Steak Burger...I was definitely in for a surprise, but not a good one. Their "special" sauce overpowered the whole burger and the only thing I tasted was that disgustingness. The only good thing about that burger was the fresh lettuce. I took a bite of the Hickory Burger and it tasted sooo much better!! I think they used a special BBQ sauce for this burger and they definitely didn't put a ladle full of sauce on this burger like they did on the Steak Burger.So disappointed by the food, I was still willing to give this diner another try by ordering a slice of their apple pie with ice cream ($7.50!!!) because after all, this place was called The Apple Pan. Well folks, my disappointment continued. The apple pie wasn't anything good or special....nor was the crust.Final words.....NEVER coming back to this diner.	0
While the food is good, the &#34;better-than-you&#34; attitudes of the staff and slow service make this West Hollywood restaurant a true thumbs-down.	0
Overall food quality OK but pricy,especially wines and drinks.     Their pasta good but pizza not impressed as it taste better at Pizza Hut.	1
There seems to be a huge communication problem between the front staff and the kitchen staff. The last couple times my girlfriend and I have ordered from these people the orders came completely screwed up. We specifically asked for no onion on our steak, it brought them, we said we wanted very little to no oil on the vegetables... They were drenched! I ordered extra butter for my mashed potato since they don't have gravy... They sent me an extra order of MP! On top of everything, they totally screwed up my receipt and charged the wrong amount on my debit card. Also, I ordered our steak med well, it came med rare! I would honestly suggest that if it's b4 2am, go o Ralph's and get something to cook at home or just go to the downtown ihop!	0
My cousin recommended this place for breakfast, so I thought we&#39;d try it out. Came in around 10 on a weekday and were seated right away.<br><br>The interior wasn&#39;t what I was expecting. It feels sorta like a throwback diner, but it&#39;s got a nice vibe. Service was very friendly, despite the fact that it got quite busy around 11. <br><br>I had the french toast souffle and my cousin got the blueberry ricotta pancakes, and we got a side of the fried potatoes. Everything we ordered was pretty good. I thought the french toast souffle could have used a bit more cinnamon, but the maple syrup complemented it nicely. I had a bite of my cousin&#39;s pancakes and almost wish I had ordered the pancakes instead. They were really, really good! Super light and fluffy and full of deliciousness. The fried potatoes were pretty impressive too. They were nicely seasoned and tasted vaguely of something citrus-y.<br><br>We took our time eating (girl talk + large portions) but didn&#39;t feel rushed to leave. Once we finished our food they gave us these awesome super minty mints that seemed to last forever. <br><br>Overall, this is a nice place for a good, hearty breakfast :)	1
I love watching The Best Thing I ever Ate on the food network. So when I see places in Los Angeles I take note. This episode was the best thing I ever ate with chop sticks. So one of the &#34;food experts&#34; recomended Yang Chow in China Town and mentioned the slippery shrimp. So off I went with two friends. For starters we were crammed into a really small table aginst the wall. The service was pretty good I must say. So we ordered several items including the slippery shrimp. I really this food expert from the show has never tasted his own food because if the food from Yang Chow is among the best food he&#39;s ever eaten I really would not want to taste anything he&#39;s cook. To say the food at Yang Chow tasted bad would mean that it even had any taste at all. The slippery shrimp that this food expert claimed was the best thing he ever ate was nothing more than tiny shrimp in way too much breading that was completely devoid of taste the other dishes were slathered with too much MSG and sugar. The place was packed so there&#39;s no accounting for taste. But I really don&#39;t see how anyone could call this the best thing they ever ate. If someone tells you about this place pass them by. I give them one star because there&#39;s nothing lower	0
I went to the Ravenna branch of India Bistro last night with my wife and another couple.	1
super sweet secret spot. if you happen to find it please don&#39;t tell anyone else :)<br><br>(there would be 5 stars if it weren&#39;t for the awful euro-trash techno blaring above our table over dinner).	1
I really like this place. Since I live within a block, it&#39;s refreshing to have a cool cafe business. Plus, the coffee is really delicious. If you&#39;re used to Starbucks or a generic coffee, this place may throw you off at first. Real quality coffee has a cost so I don&#39;t find it expensive for the quality. <br><br>I kind of wish they had more events or something outside of the dance stuff. I check their website sparingly, so I might be talking out of my ass. Haha	1
my friend has been raving about this place for their turkey sandwich, also called bobby&#39;s sandwich,<br>ingredients: its filled with turkey, cranberry, stuffing &amp; a light mayonnaise on a French roll.<br>Upon eating it, I think ive had better, the bread is cold, and would taste much better if it was toasted, also since the bread was not toasted, it the sauce made it soggy quick, and over all nothing that great, I can make a better turkey leftover sandwich at home.	0
The first and obvious question about this place is: Why will I buy a Mexican food inside a gas station?<br><br>Why not?<br><br>Try the Chili Verde plate, especially the Chile Verde (making the 2014 Desert Companion list of Delicious Meal under $10), Carne Asada Fries and the Rolled Taco with Guacamole, and you will be a fan of this one-man-chef&#39;s cooking. 91.37% guaranteed.<br><br>Disclaimer: prepare to wait longer because of the solo service mentioned above.<br><br>If you&#39;re comfortable eating on the counter or on a bench outside while watching the car detailing, treat yourself casually with the experience. Did I not tell you this fast food is INSIDE the gas station? Or if you&#39;re like me, bring it at Exploration Peak Park. Enjoy!	1
High quality, healthy place for a wrap/salad with any kind of green and any kind of toppings you could want.	1
Bring cash and get yourself a great Gyro! The line is usually out the door at lunch. Not open Sunday's and closed right after Thanksgiving until sometime in January while the owners go to Greece!	1
Oh, goodness gracious me, the Apple Pan. Because LA is such a brand spankin&#39; NEW kind of town (meaning &#34;oldest restaurant in town&#34; is 1919), anything that is remotely redolent of retro-kitsch-history is exceedingly appealing. And if they serve on of the absolute best burgers in town, WELL .....so much the better.<br><br>The place is always packed- you will usually have to cool your heels for a few while waiting for a seat at the circular counter. You&#39;ll get a gruff waiter who has been there a good solid 20 years (they have great stories if you charm &#39;em out of the gruffitude) and a minimal selections of a couple kinds of burgers, a tuna sandwich (I think), fries, drinks, pie. I go for hickory steak burger with fries.<br><br>Everything comes in paper wrappers or el retro plastic holders. The meat is top-quality (and I am a girl who usually does not touch red meat- basically if it is not Apple Pan or In&#39;N&#39;Out I am in the world of tofu derivatives). Super fun place to take the same kind of person who would have loved the old Farmer&#39;s Market.	1
Had such an amazing time last night! This place is over the top with their presentation! The food was delicious too! Will go back again for their popcorn shrimp YUMM!	1
The Big Apple Deli is great. The food is amazing. Huge sandwiches. Good breakfast. Try the kinish. Yumm.	1
I dont live in miami- I live in two different cities (LA &amp; NYC) where the sushi is 5 stars always....<br><br>but this place is delish.... the owner is super cool and the food is really good for being where it is. love it.	1
Food was great, except the hamachi dish which was just ok. <br><br>Big problem we had was that the service was just abysmal. I had to go ask someone else for help more than once and the help only showed up after the second request. If it is busy like it was last night all the time, management should staff up. Just one or maybe even two more servers will help your guests leave happy. <br><br>Tip: sit at the bar (where I ended up going to get my own drinks) - it looked like they actually paid close attention to their patrons! <br><br>Overall, bad service will prevent us from returning.	0
I've been going to Marigold since it opened and am a fan. I love their french toast and when they have it, pancakes with the marscapone cheese. YUM.	1
Good chinese food!	1
Man (and woman - I&#39;m an equal opportunity exclamationist)! This establishment came highly recommended, and the Yelp reviews were superb. Which made it all the worse when we came in, snagged a seat in the lounge, and were then treated to a subpar meal. <br><br>Which is really too bad. The service was good, the ambiance (especially in the lounge) was welcoming but upscale and almost intimate. Oh, and make sure you don&#39;t take the recommendation of 2-3 dishes per person. That was way too much food, and we only ate about half of everything. Imagine if we&#39;d liked it. <br><br>Oh, the food. <br><br>The broccoli-cheddar bread: chewy. Underbaked maybe? <br>Goat and lobster dish: eh. Lobster wasn&#39;t cooked well, neither was goat. <br>Escargot ravioli: couldn&#39;t finish it (and this was two hungry people). <br>Shishito peppers: Kind of like mac n cheese topping on peppers, which could have been good, but was really just heavy and slimy. <br>Mushroom ragout: also slimy and heavy<br>Chickpea fritters: mediocre at best<br>Kohlrabi salad: probably the best thing we had<br><br>Mostly, the food was heavy, bizarre in texture and overall disappointing. <br><br>Admittedly, we are from California and perhaps have different taste-buds than Chicagoians? Regardless, I&#39;d steer clear of this place. Unless you wanted to sit at the bar for a beer. Probably can&#39;t go wrong there.	0
The worst. Philly Cheese steak consists of cold mystery meat and a hunk of cheesish run under a broiler. I got my money back and went to Subway.	0
Not sure entirely why I love this place. Is is the beer, the cute location and ample seating? Or the food, I have to say they have a great selection and wide variety of foods to feast on. My favorite is their Brussel sprouts, amazing, I crave these like no one's business. The farrow salad with steak was pretty good, steak was slightly overcooked though, still enjoyed every bite. Their mushroom cake/tart amazing, a generous mound of mushrooms in cream sauce, this was gone quick. Their sandwiches are also pretty amazing. I've been here way to many times to talk about every dish I've eaten. Service is a-ok, not awful not amazing.	1
Like all other Asian girls out there, I like a cute cafe where I could fantasize that I were sitting in some sort of K-drama scene with my prince charming. Obviously, it&#39;s a fantasy. =) But Cafe Hanamizuki fulfills that longing. =)<br><br>After discovering this tiny cafe via Yelp, I have been visiting the cafe quite often. The decor just makes me happy, what can I say. They have many types of onigiri to choose from. I like that it&#39;s not too loud in there and it&#39;s a nice place to study.	1
This place blows more than Jenna Jamison. Horrible place, they think they&#39;re the shit and they clearly aren&#39;t. I wish I could give zero stars.	0
I would give this restaurant zero stars if Yelp afforded me the privilege. <br><br>In summary: <br>- Fake $6 orange juice (lies that it was fresh squeezed)<br>- women&#39;s bowling on TV (weird vibes)<br>- Scolding hot plate<br>- Less than mediocre food<br>- Messed up orders<br>- Empty<br>- Terrible service<br>- Smells like sewer<br><br>We attempted to get brunch at Westville around the corner, however Westville had a 45 minute wait. We noticed Union Bar &amp; Kitchen as we walked by, and thought we were about to discover one of NYC&#39;s hidden gems, as it is fairly new but has a 4.5 star Yelp rating-- boy were we wrong. <br><br>I have had VERY few poor dining experiences in NYC, and this was one of them. We were craving fresh squeezed orange juice, and while we were perplexed by the $6 price, we went ahead and ordered. The first thing we noticed was that it had ice. What fresh squeezed Oj has ice?? The second thing we noticed, was that it tasted worse than what is typically served on a flight. Fresh squeezed? LIES. It wasn&#39;t even Tropicana. How disappointing. <br><br>The chef/waiter handed by friend a scolding hot plate that almost burned her hands, a plate that had a different side than what she ordered. The staff seemed flustered and confused, even though there were only three full tables in the empty restaurant and messed up our order. The ambiance, with women&#39;s bowling playing on the tv in the background, was sterile and unwelcoming. <br><br>The food itself was less than average. Brunch is easy to master, especially in NYC, but man, this did not satisfy our hungover cravings. In fact, we had to stop by Dominique Ansel&#39;s bakery after to redeem our taste buds. <br><br>I am convinced that the 30 previous Yelp reviews raving about this restaurant were staged. As are the professional-grade photographs of the food, which absolutely DO NOT appear as pictured. <br><br>I would not wish this dining experience upon anyone. There are so many restaurants in NYC, and most of them are worth a long wait.	0
A fun looking spot that is part of a Russian chain; hence, the old farming implements hanging from the ceiling, the waiters in costume, the complimentary parting shot of spicy vodka and slice of pickle. Lovely and friendly staff.<br><br> One expects crowds on a Thanksgiving weekend Saturday evening. The nearly empty restaurant (when we left at 8PM) may speak to the lackluster food. Borscht was good, but the Ukrainian dishes, such as latkes, dumplings, etc. were flavorless and mostly flour and bread. A non-alcoholic home-made &#34;beer&#34; is unusual tasting and definitely worth a try (&#34;kvas&#34;).<br><br>I was hoping for some exciting food, which is why we went with a friend from Kazakhstan. Not sure why other reviews rave about the food.	0
I gave this place 3 tries and only one was decent enough to make me think it MIGHT have been worth the price. Off the bat, let me just say that this place is overpriced in my opinion, especially considering the amount of food given.I've seen Subway 6 inch sandwiches bigger than their's, and the fries definitely did not do the price tag justice.My first experience was with the Fried Chicken Sammy. Taste-wise, it just met the bare minimum. I probably could have gone to Carl's Jr. and gotten the same sandwich. However, what I really disliked was that the actual chicken part was about half the size of the sandwich itself. I mostly just got bites of bread and vegetables.My second time was the better experience; I ordered the Young Turk Hoagie, and this was the only sandwich I felt I actually enjoyed eating. Plenty of turkey, cherry peppers were on point, everything tasted good, etc. If I, for whatever reason, ever decide to come here again, this is what I'll be getting.My third (and most likely last) experience was with the Whiz Wit, which is their standard Philly Cheesesteak. It turned out to be nothing more that a mushy lump of meat, cheese, bread, and salt. I couldn't even unwrap the thing without performing some minor soggy wrapper surgery. The only reason I ended up finishing it was because I was practically starving and my Korean cheapness would not allow me to throw away the $8 I paid for that sad little unimposing excuse of a sandwich.Food aside, the establishment itself seems pretty clean, and the workers are all young and friendly. That and the Young Turk Hoagie are the only things keeping this place from falling to 1-star in my book.Recommendation: Boo's on Wilshire	0
Really awesome burger at The Bowery! My burger was perfectly cooked and loaded with &#34;the works&#34; (cheese, bacon, mushrooms, onions) for $12. Sweet potato fries were just okay, and I wouldn&#39;t pay extra for them in the future (they&#39;re $3 for a side). Beers were reasonably priced too. The place itself is really small, but it&#39;s got a casual/cool vibe that&#39;s not at all Hollywood pretentious... definitely a great spot for a quick dinner or some beers before a movie.	1
From the moment I stepped in Hollywood Corner (no, it's not a strip club), I knew I would be well taken care of. They must have read me like newspaper headline, "Desperately Seeking Outlet," because I was immediately directed to a large booth with access to juicy power. Ahh, this place gets me.The three gentlemen that helped me over the course of my 6 hour play date with my laptop were charming, courteous, helpful and all around good guys. They made it seem as if they were there to serve me, and me only, and I like that kind of service!I ordered an iced soy vanilla latte (shocker!) to hold me over until I was ready to chow down on their lunch menu later in the day. It was the most supercalifragilisticexpialidocious non-alcoholic beverage I have ever sipped on. I mean, this thing was the most flavorful, creamy drink ever. Like a candy cloud in my mouth! I tried not to go to town on it so that I could savor every last slurpy. It really was the latte of my dreams. Just writing about it puts a grinny grin on my chinny chin.The salad (chicken, spring greens - meh, pine nuts, and some other things) was delicious as well and really did the afternoon trick, but man oh man, was that latte the breakout star of this caffeine scene!	1
Almost hidden away, deep into the abyss of a dark narrow alley in Little Tokyo, is a quaint and charming bar lounge with an atmosphere that is inviting, relaxed, slightly dim yet cheery. Unusually sandwiched between two brick buildings, the venue is narrow in width and long in length.They offer artisan craft beers such as those brewed by Stone, as well as a vast selection of Japanese imported beers. They also offer rather hard-to-find Allagash Curieux which is an eclectic beer fermented in whiskey barrels. Ask for wasabi fries if you like garlic fries smothered in a light wasabi sauce. I find this unusual combination to work harmoniously and deliciously.The bartender is extremely helpful by giving small beer samples from tap for your tasting notes. There's no way you can order a beer you don't like. Overall, I give 4.75.	1
We went to this place after seeing Alvin AIley perform that Dorothy Chandler Pavillion. Hungry, we knew this place was still open and went in. We had to pay to park for the place right across the street, even at midnight, which wass like $3.We went in and didn't get service until we asked the cashier if we could just save them some time and seat ourselves. After looking at the menu of greasy, fattening, starchy, fried foods, we decided our orders. Even though the place clearly served chicken, the waiter refused to subsitute chicken on by friend's beef sandwhich, so he ordered an omelette instead.The waiter brought us an omelett, and my friend cut it open while oil poured out of it. The waiter then came back and said he brought us the wrong order. After my friend saw how the omelette looked, he asked if he could changed his order but the waiter refused, saying that they already started cooking it.My friend being from New York, he didn't let that settle easily, so the waiter just walked off while they were talking, and brought back his order, and walked away--basically forcing him to eat his food. Never going there again because of that. Shouldn't be forced to eat something if they wanted to change their order. Place is also a bit overpriced and isn't the healthies menu at all. We should have just walked out LoL.	0
Major food group has done it again !! From the moment we enter we know we are not in Kansas anymore. Beautifully dressed hostess seems like she stepped out of a Caribbean paradise fashion magazine greets us passionately. Eyeing the beautiful Booths in the middle of the dining room we ask can we? And she tried and we can ! Thank you ! As we look into the menu, the server immediately comes &amp; make sure we know what we are looking at, answering every question we have and then some. So our foodgasmic experience begins, first off the cocktails !! Presentation&#39;s a plus. Flavor Strong, balanced &amp; soooo good. ZZ clam bar should be proud. Second...appetizers~<br>Calabrian tuna Cecina &amp; squash carpaccio WOW super good. Came with two house sauces that&#39;s amazing also. Then we had the artichoke grape &amp; octopus skewer WOW again ! Four apps and two cocktails in its safe to say that this will be in the top five new hotspot in the summer of NYC baby. So book that reservation NOW. Ambience can not be more banging, great unique music selection ! Great bar scene ! Two more cocktails please with our grilled porgy...also delicious. Now down to the last act..desserts. We ordered the cannolis trio and the lime meringue, not impressed. Dirty&#39;s french desserts we yearn for. Santina is not just another restaurant in the meatpacking district...it&#39;s the heart and soul(food) of the MPD.	1
Brought my gf to Hollywood for a one night visit. She had never been before. I told her I wanted to go to Little Doms. I had gone there last year and sat at the bar and had a yummy neapolitan thin crust pizza. I went online to make a reservation since it was a Saturday night. We couldn&#39;t get a table until 9:30pm. But that was ok because we were willing to wait. I ordered a pizza with sausage and an egg on the top. I had seen it on the Food Network and thought it sounded interesting and I love eggs. The pizza was good, my only complaint is I like my egg cooked a little longer. The whites were a bit runny. My gf had a pasta dish which she thought was just ok. We ordered a bottle of their red table wine, which we loved. Little Doms is a cute place and I can&#39;t wait to go back!	1
If you're craving a REAL donut this is the one to get. Sinfully delicious!	1
This is one of my favorite spots in the city! I work around the corner and come here for the lunch special all the time. I highly recommend the steak sandwich and the shrimp roll. The deep-fried burger is a MUST TRY. Great quality food and bonus points for being well priced. Their menu is surprisingly extensive for such a cozy spot. Can&#39;t wait to come by for dinner.	1
My go-to KBBQ place. This is the place I recommend to all my out-of-towners. <br><br>I prefer to go on weeknights rather than weekends, as I know most KBBQ places get packed on weekends. 7-8PM on M-W barely has a wait, and there&#39;s lots of free street parking in the neighborhood behind this plaza. There&#39;s also valet parking in front available for $2. <br><br>For $17.99, there&#39;s a variety of meat you can choose from and the quality&#39;s pretty good. I love the options of all the side dishes, more than the other kbbq places I&#39;ve been to. They even have a little bit of ddukbbokki as a banchan. The only thing I miss at this place are the pancakes, whether it be kimchi or seafood pancakes. They have dwenjang jjigae and kimchi jjigae available, steamed egg, and two types of kimchi mixed rice. I like the one that comes in the round pot (yang-bap), rather than the traditional lunchbox where they shake the rice, but you can get both to try. Rather than a salad, they have a really good onion mix that pairs well with the meat. The servers are attentive if they&#39;re not super busy, and also when you&#39;re slightly aggressive (as you have to be with most Korean places). They can also be a bit sassy, but I think that&#39;s part of the fun. They&#39;re also good at changing the grills without being asked. <br><br>I recommend not bringing in jackets, and also putting purses into the round seats where the tops open up, to save from being contaminated with the long-lasting kbbq smell that is ever so pungent. There&#39;s also a late-night special they have if you&#39;re looking to drink/eat kogi after 10pm. <br><br>The only con about this place is that they seem to have a new policy of a minimum of $20 on credit cards. It seems new because I&#39;ve never had this problem all the other times I&#39;ve been there...	1
I love this authentic Japanese restaurant! It delivers, every time. I like their staff-the chefs are ultra poised while serving their 110% best for their customers. The waiters are prompt, friendly, and knowledgeable about the menu/area/etc. I like the atmosphere! It is located in such a perfectly quaint nook in Little Tokyo. Clean. Bathrooms are clean, too. The prices aren't through the roof either-Plus! Lunch is great, dinner is great, although sometimes it gets pretty packed at night, esp on weekends.	1
Good looking, bad tasting food. Definitely didn&#39;t live up to the hype. We ordered the kale salad and pizza with mushroom, tomatoes, caramelized onions (the last item on the pizza menu). The kale salad had a really heavy sweet dressing. It was so sugary that I couldn&#39;t continue after a few tries. All I tested was sugar. Why ruin something so healthy as kale with so much sugar? It beats the purpose. The pizza had so much onion that you couldn&#39;t taste the tomato or the mushroom. I only finished it because I was hungry. So much for a $16 pizza. In the end we spent $70 for just sugar and onion. Italian food is about making the best of every ingredient while preserving the simplicity. Seeing one ingredient dominate all else made me feel like I was eating cheap Chinese take out.	0
Still a solid 5, but wish I could add a few more stars for standout service today!	0
Great food and imaginative dishes.  Excellent wine choices.	0
Oh, Precita Park Cafe, how I've tried to like you. You just continually fail miserably. Despite these failures I keep coming back and coming back, but today was my breaking point.Since moving to the neighborhood I've frequented PPC out of convenience, I enjoy the coffee and I must say the front of house staff is wonderful. This review has nothing to do with these folks. I believe that the problem is ownership and the kitchen and what I perceive to be a constant and total breakdown of communication between the customer and the skillet. I cannot even begin to fathom the number of times I've received food that was either not what I ordered, undercooked, overcooked or even rotten (on one occasion). Nor can I count the number of times I waited an inordinate amount of time for the simplest of orders.Rather than list every bad experience I've ever had, I'm going to outline the final bad experience (which just occurred) and why I'll never set foot in Precita Park Cafe again. As I do, I waddled down from my house and ordered one of my go to dishes, the Cobb salad, substituting the blue cheese dressing with balsamic vinaigrette. After the dish came out I noticed (after eating some of it) that the chicken was raw in the middle. I discreetly brought the dish to the counter and quietly told the first person to ask what I needed what the problem was. It was the owner, I'm fairly certain. She offered no apology, just to cook a new chicken breast and make a new salad. Fine, I said, but I'll skip the chicken. So the new salad comes out and the very nice employee (I wish I knew his name but he's fantastic and always made me feel very welcome) gave me a $5 gift card. Ha! If I was the owner I'd make damn sure I'd personally speak with a long time customer after serving them RAW CHICKEN and that the gift card I offer COVERS THE COST OF THE MEAL! She has her employee apologize while she fiddles on her laptop? Unbelievable. I'm starving and write it off and dig into my new, chickenless Cobb. I take one bite a realize that it's covered in some kind of Asian style miso dressing. Miso and blue cheese. Ever heard of that? I walk out in disgust. Sounds dramatic you say? Why walk out? Why didn't I demand my money back? Well, this is long the pattern of experience I've had and rather than ask for a mere $12 back, I'm going to not give them another dime. Not a dime. Also, it's shitty for the cashier to have to deal with a million complaints due to an inept kitchen and owner. I just wanted out of that place. Until new ownership takes over, PPC has lost me as a customer for good, and I'm just fine with that. I just hope that the homeless man I gave the gift card too has a better experience.	0
I wanted to like this place. Great food and huge beer selection but the whole toddelers running around really ruined it for me. If you have plans for a nice, romantic dinner they will soon be ruined by crying and screaching. The children also distract the waitstaff to the point if it being maddening. <br>I won&#39;t be back.	0
I had a Groupon for this place $15 for $30, best Groupon I have ever purchased. I had the Ribs along with the southern mac n cheese and coleslaw. All I can say was wow. Best Mac n cheese I have ever had!!!!! I eat at alot of BBQ joints and I can tell you that these ribs were terrific.	0
I was a little concerned about the Elliott Bay Public House and Eatery on my first visit. When my wife and I walked up to the hostess desk we weren't greeted warmly and it wasn't very busy.	1
I&#39;ve been to other PF Changs that were better, much better than this one. The wait time for a table was alright. The hostesses did their best to get people seated and that was understandable. It was busy when I got there so I had to wait about 30min to get seated.<br><br>I don&#39;t know which was worse, the waitress or the food. The server was pretty rude and lacked manners. No smile whatsoever and a &#34;I don&#39;t want to be here&#34; attitude. She walked by many times pretending not to see my table. Always in a hurry and always pissed off. <br><br>The rice was undercooked. By that I mean the little pieces of rice were stone hard when it met my teeth. Heck, chewing grass would&#39;ve been an easier task. The flavor was alright but it was nowhere near impressive. <br><br>No, I&#39;m not going back.	0
KenScale: 8.0/10<br><br>Wallflower is a cocktail bar/restaurant from Xavier Herit (who used to be the head bartender at Daniel) and chef Jared Strafford-Hill. I&#39;ve been meaning to check out this place for cocktails after a dinner perhaps, but then heard the food here was also a nice surprise, so decided to show up for a full meal and cocktails instead. Overall, I was pretty impressed with the French-influenced dishes as well as the cocktails.<br><br>My meal went off to a great start with black sea bass crudo with apple and seaweed, which was very tender and flavored perfectly (not too much spice or lemon that so oftentimes undermines crudo dishes). Brebis with eggplant, chorizo and almond oil was also a pleasant bite. I couldn&#39;t stop thinking about the brandade (a type of cod) sandwich with tomato and arugula, which was another small dish that, while simple, had great balance of flavor and texture. Beef short ribs with bacon, onions, mushrooms and potatoes were also cooked very tender, and had the right flavors (i.e. no overdressing that can kill the texture of the ribs). For dessert, I had brioche with pear confit and vanilla ice cream, another excellent dish that was not overly sweet while offering the juicy texture of pear confit. <br><br>I tried several cocktails, mostly on the stronger, drier side. I liked rye whiskey-based John Doe and rum-based Smoking Guns (which did have a very smoky feel), while puzzled slightly by the flavor of Mother&#39;s Milk that uses tea and milk. As I didn&#39;t have a reservation, I tried a walk-in on a Saturday night, and ended up waiting for an hour and a half, as the restaurant is pretty tiny and already seems to be gaining buzz as a nice neighborhood place. My suggestion, therefore, is to get a reservation early or just show up early to see if you can snag seats at the bar area where you can watch Herit in action. Wallflower is another welcome addition to a growing list of bars in NYC that also showcase surprisingly elegant food, and I highly recommend it for a casual date night or a night out for sophisticated cocktails and small bites.	1
The best food court probably in America.<br><br>Brand new. Everything is clean. The restaurant choices are insane. Tons of seating. The staff at all the different spots are helpful. The food is delicious. When Blue Ribbon Sushi finally opens, this place will be bananas.	1
Three years ago we came to Miami on vacation and stumbled upon this place.... We found it again!!! Everything was great, the food, service, and the beer was cold!!<br>We ordered from their nightly dinner specials! Great prices. My husband ordered the Cuban sandwich! Yum yum<br>Anytime we vacation here.... We will be eating here!	1
Um, the one star is for the view & location. Service was just alright. Given the price points and ambiance of Waterbar, it definitely isn't worth the price.	0
This place nurses a hangover better than anything else	1
I would lean more towards a 2.5...Like the other reviewers mentioned, the dishes here are heavy on broth & noodles, and short on the stuffing. I've been twice in the last week or so; the first time I got the beef & vegetable ramen, and the second the chicken & veggie.Both dishes were pretty sparse on the veggie. I think the chicken dish had approximately 3 zucchini slices and 1 broccoli floret. I don't even remember any in the beef. As for the amount of meat, the chicken had barely a full chicken thigh in it, and the beef about 6 strips. Pretty low for the hefty 12$+ price tag.The noodles and broth were both very good -- I liked the udon more than the ramen -- but for the price I expected a way more satisfying meal.	0
I don&#39;t know what the fuzz is all about, to me the &#34;original Fritas&#34; is nothing but a nasty, greasy and overly salty patty on a tasteless bread, topped by even more greasy and salty potato sticks....<br>Anthony must have been so hangover that her needed that grease!	0
Favorite burger place in West Los Angeles, just for a solid tasty burger.	1
The ambiance and view at this place is awesome! Me and my girlfriends had just gotten back from New York and wanted to do something rooftop because we were missing NYC. This definitely did the trick! I recommend making reservations like we did because there was a huge wait. You have to take the elevator up to the restaurant. The food was also delcious. We ordered a carafe or sangria and a bottle of champagne with our brunch. Will be going back here soon.	1
I loved everything I ate here! Started off with the Wood Oven Baked Shrimp, Artichokes, &amp; Mozzarella for appetizer. Then my cousin and I shared two dishes: the Ricotta Gnocchi Fritto w/ Chanterelles, Tuscan Kale, &amp; Porcini Cream and I had Whitefish Piccatta with an order of corn on the side. If you love things that are cheesy, creamy, and flavorful...you will enjoy these types of dishes. The whitefish was amazing...one of the best fish plates I&#39;ve had in a long time...very flavorful. I don&#39;t remember the names of the wines we had, but they were also very good too. Service was great...our server made great recommendations, she was very friendly and attentive. Ate outside and I enjoyed that also. Waited for about 15 minutes around 8pm on a weekday. I know the wait can be longer, like 45 minutes, as I tried to eat there another time. Kinda pricey, but for enjoying every thing I got...it was worth it to me.	1
I went here looking for a bowl of clam chowder and it was not very tasty. I actually had a sample soup tasting for 2 stores and honestly, I'd rather pay double and go up the street and have a great bowl of chowder. I ended up just tossing the soup.	0
My boyfriend is a huge fan of budae jjigae - a combination of kimchi stew with ramen, rice cakes, veggies, sausages (or spam in a lot of homemade versions), and tofu. He said that his buddy and he used to come here for their budae jjigae all the time, and that he wanted me to experience it. <br><br>I was so excited!<br><br>The service was great, and the food tasted decent. I left happy...<br><br>Until an hour later when the indigestion took hold. I couldn&#39;t put my finger on it - I felt like the whole thing was just sitting in my tummy and refusing to get broken down.<br><br>Maybe I was having an off day - my boyfriend was fine.<br><br>So a few weeks later, we went back for the same dish. <br><br>Later that night, I sat down with an Alka Seltzer and broke the sad news to my boyfriend: He can go with his buddies, but I won&#39;t be going back there anymore.<br><br>IN ALL FAIRNESS: I haven&#39;t heard of anyone else being sick after eating here, and the budae jjigae was the ONLY think I ate there, so everything else may be yummy and all that, but I just don&#39;t think I&#39;ll have the stomach to go back any time soon.	0
Tried this place based on superb reviews.	0
let me tell you this is an amazing place, not only is it romantic, but the view provides such a stress reliever, the food is amazing ! I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s as French as LA can get but it&#39;s pretty up there. They have a great selection of pairing wines to go with the food.i had the FILET MIGNON which was grilled asparagus, potatoes, and some bearnaise sauce. It was AWESOME and I&#39;m actually craving it now. But above all my service was Grea	1
The staff here is the nicest most welcoming restaurant staff ever each time I go! I really feel at home. The food, from mangu to mofongo is AMAZING! Omg my mouth waters just thinking of their food! So good!!!!!! Must try! Mangu w fried eggs and cheese and salami! Ugh! To die for!	1
went there today and we were informed that the eggs were no longer 'cage-free' 'free-range' and/or organic. the server told us they switched from organic free range to conventional eggs in all breakfast and other dishes that use eggs. quite the bummer when an establishment goes from organic free-range happy chickens to gmo-laden factory-farmed sad chickens... especially when a decent brunch for two will be in the $50 range.however they do serve mary's which is a great brand.just bummed we can't go here anymore for brunch.	0
AMAZING! Came here for lunch and was seated very quickly. We had the salsa and guac with homemade chips which were delicious! I had the Bad Wolf burger which omg was so good- one of the top burgers I&#39;ve ever had in Chicago! The fries with the chipotle sauce was tasty and salted perfectly! I can&#39;t say anything bad about this place.	1
Very disappointed. The reviews are so impressive but we found the dumplings tasteless. We left and went to Dumpling Man, a favorite.	0
Damn, damn, damn, I was hoping our childhood neighborhood of Palms was starting some sort of cool culinary scene when I saw the Doughroom open. The open loft, industrial aesthetic, and trendy pizza menu looked promising as we entered.<br><br>Unfortunately, our meal ended up taking over an hour and included mediocre pizza that hardly rivals the destination pizzerias proliferating all over town. <br><br>We ordered a sage and homemade sausage pizza that (literally) had one piece of sausage per slice. The crust was bland, soggy, and a total waste of a 45 minute wait. The open kitchen allowed us to watch the fumbling of a very overworked chef who attempted to push food out quickly, while also maintaining some semblance of aesthetics and quality control. We had chopped parsley and a smattering of garnishes that did not justify the extra two minutes we waited as the poor waitress stood around frustrated and helpless. I wanted to hug her as she stood by the chef who was delicately arranging ingredients and wiping down the plate of completely average food.<br><br>Maybe the kitchen staff was short? Maybe I need more patience because I am committed to Palms having great food (besides Indonesian)now that Chego is gone. Either way, Doughroom, we WANT to like you, your friendly and well intentioned waitress, and the balls it takes to open a restaurant in this area. But, please step it up. Culver City is only five minutes away and it is very tempting to never return.<br><br>Sorry for the candor and critical tone- I truly hope that Doughroom can evolve and remedy the issues it faces today. If so, we will be back with bells on.	0
Pretty good place. First visit tonight, not something to write home about but not the worst either.	0
Food ok. Service consistently poor to awful. Lighting painfully low.	0
Amazing rooftop view. Great and attentive service.<br><br>I wouldn&#39;t bring a group of no more than 10. It&#39;s a great location, but quite small, and if you want a table or area reserved for a large group, this would not be the place to do it. Great place for casual meetings of drinks and small bites, but that&#39;s about it.<br><br>It&#39;s not a restaurant that serves drinks, or a bar that serves food, I find it somewhere still in middle.<br><br>Perch was less than two weeks open, so I respect it for where it&#39;s going and I will return when it matures. Perch serves pricey french food, but good. The menu was limited, though since it was 2 weeks since its inception, I&#39;m sure the dishes will grow.<br><br>My group of six friends decided to check-out the entire menu so we picked at its various dishes. The Brocollini salad is good, though I prefer the prosciutto sliced smaller. Don&#39;t be afraid of the frog legs, a good, small appetizer that really does taste like chicken. The Risotto was a bit wet, a bit soggy than what I have tried at other place. <br><br>I DID love the Duck, Duck, Goose appetizer. It was great. I never had duck bacon before and it was served on small bites of bread. Savory.<br><br>Now, I was not impressed with the Cordon Bleu &#34;Poppers&#34; tasted like chicken nuggets dipped in bleu cheese. Nothing surprising there.<br><br>And, the desserts? Tasted my first gooseberry with the Apple Tart Napoleon dessert. It was a pretty apple tart served with a small scoop of ice cream. Good for one. The Beignets are those warm puffy doughnuts. Nothing special here, either. Though the strawberry jam was a treat. The Chocolate Creme pot is a chocolate pudding with slices of fruit. <br><br>Drinks were strong (as I was told), and the bottle service is great.<br><br>I say this place will only get better with time. Definitely a great place to go for quick drinks and good company. They should look into expanding their appetizer menus.	1
If you feel like eating a bottle of food coloring this is the place. <br>Ordered delivery. <br>Ordered the Maldives rice, awesome asparagus, rev velvet and a Thai tee. <br>Start with the good. Amazing Thai tee. The good ends there. The &#34;Maldives rice&#34; was rice drenched in blue food coloring with over cooked seafood on top. Looked like play dough but I took a bite. So sickening. What respectable chef would add such a large amount (if any) of food coloring to rice to the point every vegetable is BLUE. The asparagus was anything but awesome and the red velvet was store bough cake drenched in marachino cherries. <br>Order time was over an hour.	0
Menu is short. Excellent black bean veggie burger and seasoned waffle fries. Old fashioneds are made from scratch/muddled. I had excellent service while there--nice, competent bartender came outside to refill drinks several times. It was a comfortable experience, relaxing outside watching the waves. Veggie people beware taxidermied animals inside.	0
Great pasta, I had the lobster ravioli, it came with a side of garlic bread. No salad. But for 8 bucks, it was really good ravioli. There&#39;s not much room to sit and the chairs and tables aren&#39;t that comfortable anyway, so buy your food and take the curvy street just north of the restaurant to the little park with benches over looking the bay. Also, check the hours, it&#39;s mostly a lunch place.	1
This a a pretty great spot! For Taco&#39;s in DTLA Tacos Tumbras a Tomas is THE BEST.<br>However, Guisados is a great addition. The good is amazing and the service is also great. This place is worth checking out!	1
Canter&#39;s Deli was one of the first places I had to eat at when I moved here. Having come from South Florida, Home of the Rascal House, it had a lot to prove, but it held up quite well, and every trip since, has been pretty darn good. <br><br>Let&#39;s start out with what makes Canter&#39;s unique. The rye bread is amazing. They have the best rye bread I&#39;ve ever had at any deli anywhere. A golden tasty crust encircling a soft seeded rye is the backbone of all their sandwiches for me. Any time I go there, I get a loaf to take home. I tend to favor their pastrami over their corned beef a bit. Sometimes when it&#39;s busy, they get a little lazy and let the pastrami and corned beef sit on the slicer too long between sandwiches. It needs to keep going back in the steamer to keep it warm and juicy. There are usually several pieces of pastrami and corned beef in the steamer, and they should alternate between them, so they are always warm. When it&#39;s busy they just keep slicing the same one, and if you aren&#39;t the first on that particular pastrami or corned beef, it might not be at it&#39;s peak when it gets to your table. <br><br>I also love Canter&#39;s mustard. They use Beaver Brand Deli Mustard, which I have never had until I was at Canter&#39;s. It has a slight horseradish taste to it, which makes it unique. Even though they don&#39;t make their mustard, I still associate that flavor with Canter&#39;s. I&#39;m pretty sure they do have other mustards available. But it&#39;s so good with the Pastrami and Corned Beef, you don&#39;t need anything else. <br><br>I wasn&#39;t that big of a fan of their Ruben, but I have rectified that. Canter&#39;s puts their corned beef on the grill before putting it in the sandwich. This dries out the corned beef a bit, so now I ask them not to grill the corned beef. And it&#39;s perfectly steamy and moist in my grilled Ruben. I&#39;ve never had a problem ordering it this way, they seem very accommodating. <br><br>Also of note, Canter&#39;s has the best potato knish, I&#39;ve ever had. The mashed potato filling is so full of flavor, and the outside is always perfectly done. You can get them hot or cold, go with hot, but watch out they are pipping hot. Just to prove you are in a real Jewish Deli (as if the neighborhood doesn&#39;t give it away) you can get a kasha knish. Kasha is made from buckwheat oats and can either be real lame or very tasty depending on where you order it. Canter&#39;s does it right. Next time when you go with a friend order one potato and one kasha knish and split them. I recommend dipping the kasha knish in a little mustard. <br><br>Now the down side to Canter&#39;s and why they lose a star. The desserts are pretty bad for deli standards. I don&#39;t know how or why this is. One of the first times I went to the dessert take out side, I &#34;Won&#34; a bag full of a dozen hamantaschen (those triangle pastries) and other pastries. I guess they give away a free bag for every Nth customer. Well I&#39;m guessing all the little old Jewish ladies knew it was coming up because there was a loud groan, followed by a bunch of kvetching to management and anyone that would listen. Now these weren&#39;t day olds, they told me to pick 12 fresh pastries out from the display. I made a nice diverse selection and held my trophy up for all to see in my large clear plastic bag. Parted the sea of angry onlookers and made to the car. Well I tasted everyone of those dry, not very sweet things, and the only thing it made me think of was the 4 day old &#34;gifts&#34; my grandmother used to give me from her pocketbook. The only thing missing was the bits of Kleenex stuck to them. These things were awful. I have tried to warn other friends and family that have gone to Canter&#39;s, but we still end up getting something for dessert. And it hasn&#39;t been better the 2nd time, or 3rd,4th,... For desserts, stay to the counter on the right and get a nice piece of smoked whitefish or sable to go.	1
2 Stars.. We came here last night after watching Beck and Jenny Lewis play at Club Nokia.. I have past by this cafe so many times in the past and I have always wanted to try it out.. Alas we did and I was not impressed at all.. The wait was long and I was a little hungry for I had skipped dinner and had not eaten since lunch.. Some twelve hours earlier. So, finally we are seated. Miguel was our server and he was on top of it. He alone gets 5 stars. The menu is pretty simple. You look on the wall and that's it. I ordered the scrambled eggs meal and coffee.. The bread that comes out before your meal was great.... BUT MY EGGS.. YUCK...... Overly greasy and seriously if you are taking ALLI I would recommend not taking it if you come here. You seriously will have an explosive mess... This really is a greasy dive sort of a place.... If you give two fucks about your figure then just know that this is not for you. My eggs were soaked in grease. I couldn't eat them.... On a positive note... This place certainly has it's history and it's charm. It's been open for 88 years now... I wonder how many clogged arteries has this place given now... Any-hoot I tried it and I won't be back..OH.. AND FOR THE CRAP THAT WE ATE CAME OUT OT BE A TOTAL OF $35 AND SOME CHANGE.... Over priced for crap I think...Fin	0
24/7 Breakfast spot? Nothing special, my eggs pancakes and sausages were like any other breakfast eatery. The menu is simple. It was packed and took 15 minutes to be seated. Complimentary coffee and/or tea.Cash only.	0
Had the BLT. All the ingredients were there and in a nice proportion but the bread wasn&#39;t toasted--that would&#39;ve made all the difference. For $11-12, I would also hope there was some sort of side available with this untoasted sandwich, but no. Chips are $4. Or perhaps I would&#39;ve liked a salad but i don&#39;t remember how much those were. <br><br>The pastries looked really good but despite the staff&#39;s efforts, there was no keeping the flies off them. Perhaps dish covers for these delightful looking treats will be available in the future, but I don&#39;t see myself returning until (at least) a perceived value is there.	0
The one flaw so far is that they close at 11pm!<br><br>Their food is damn tasty!! The Seared wild striped bass is definitely worth the 29 dollar price tag. Cooked to perfection. I paired it with some asparagus and i was greatly satisfied. There&#39;s a raspberry cheesecake dessert that is ridiculously delicious! It is not listed on their website menu but it is in their physical menu and I wanted to order a second round but their kitchen was closed by then. <br><br>ALSO, they actually have a shuttle that will pick you up from certain areas in astoria!!!! Just give them a call and ask them the area the shuttle picks up from. So if you have one too many you can hop on the shuttle and they&#39;ll bring you closer to home. <br><br>Definitely coming back!	1
The food was amazing! Service was great and quick! Kid friendly, couldn't ask for a better experience. In a ok location, the shopping centre is a little questionable but it would not deter me from going back again! Yummy!	0
This is a cool place. Old school diner with great food. SUPER FAST service and long lines if your unlucky... The food is classic diner fare with large portions and is very tasty. Perfect place to carbo load before going anywhere in downtown LA. <br><br>The parking lot is $6 before 5pm so get there early!!!	1
This is pretty much the place to go for breakfast if you're stuck in this area for a convention. It's a short 5 minute walk from the JW Marriott and the Ritz-Carlton, and maybe 10 minutes from the LA Convention Center if you factor in getting through the complex.Service is of the fast, easy, no-nonsense type that you'd expect from a diner like this. Coffee and water refills are nigh constant. The menu is on the wall, and don't get anything but breakfast here. I ordered my three slices of French toast at 930, got it at 940, and learned that I can eat a half triangle of French toast in 2 minutes when I really need to at 952 when I finished. I got my check, paid, and was out the door to the convention by 955. Delicious, filling, and most importantly, SO much better than the crappy continental breakfasts you get at anything in the convention center.	1
This is my favorite spot to grab a quick bite to eat in Downtown Los Angeles by Stanley Mosk!<br><br>To sum up, this place is an upscale Chipotle. The concept is the same, although I&#39;ll admit that the ingredients taste a lot fresher than Chipotle. The prices are around the same, so I&#39;d say it&#39;s a better value than what Chipotle can offer. Plus, the people are just a lot nicer and outgoing than most of the servers I&#39;ve encountered at any Chipotle. <br><br>You absolutely positively need to get the wheat chips and guacamole when you&#39;re here. I don&#39;t care if you&#39;re not hungry. Get it, anyway. It&#39;s life changing, and you&#39;ll thank me later.<br><br>If you &#34;check in&#34; here on Yelp, they give you free chips and salsa. Take advantage of it.	1
Love this place - It&#39;s perfect for a breakfast and lunch. <br><br>Recommended: Breakfast Burrito with bacon and vegetables. Turkey sandwich on thick sourdough. Iced Blended Mocha.<br><br>The burritos and sandwiches are all made to order.	1
Came here once about 5 years ago with a Jewish friend who said it was awesome. Lies!!! Came here a few days ago... and it STILL sucked.----------------LOCATION----------------Both times I've been it was after midnight. 1am and 5am.Located near Melrose, on Fairfax, near Fairfax High... trendy little spot.When you walk in the DELI is the 1st small room you walk into, filled with baked goods, then you walk into the main dining room. There are private rooms located off to the side.The ceiling is stained glass like in a church, very autumn colored.----------------THE FOOD----------------The menu looks intriguing, pastrami, sandwiches, etc, etc but just like JERRY FAMOUS DELI it's over priced and nothing special. Forgot what I got years ago but I remember it was disappointing.~ SAN FRANCISCO JOES - It's a Spinach, Mushroom, Onions and "meat" mixed with eggs. I choose SALAMI for $2 more and it was terrible. The eggs were overcooked, slightly browned, which I hate. The flavors didn't really do anything, it was subpar. Tried some EGG-SOMETHING TOAST, which was decent. The butter was the best part of the meal -_--------------AND SO-------------This place sucks. I think I had a Pastrami Sandwich before and was disappointed and last weekend was the icing on the cake cause it sucked again. Avoid this place like the plague..... I'll never come back unless it's free... and even then... fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me... fool me 3 times.....	0
I went here for the 1st time for a charity event. The sunset multi-layered view was gorgeous so kudos on their location. The service, however, was horrible. I was chatting with my friends when one of the servers actually punched me in the back. Granted it was a light punch but who does that? A light shoulder tap would've sufficed. I was also shoved aside when I was at the bar when one of the waitresses told me to move out of the way. Great venue, horrible staff.	0
We came in to pick up an order for wings on Boneless Thursday (a great deal). We were greeted by the manager, who took our order and made small talk with us. He even gave us an extra coupon for 6 free wings because my friend and I were joking with him while we waited for our food.	0
Dont ever try to go here.<br><br>Service was terrible !!!! Ordered side dishes, took forever, they forgot what we ordered. <br><br>Food was not delicious but price was high!!!	0
A little over-priced, but they have good specials for happy hour and late-night. Lots of different beers on tap which rotate seasonally and with special promos. Be sure to become a World Beer Tour member for additional giveaways. The best thing about this place is the people who go there to sit at the bar. Always a good conversation to be had about sports or otherwise.	0
Let me start off by saying I LOVE this place. But a recent bad experience left a bitter taste in my mouth. Went on 8/17, and was told they had a limited menu based on kitchen problems. OK, no big deal. As long as there is cheese and beer, I'm good. My date and I wanted to linger and order several courses and beers, but when we ordered, we were forced to order all of our food at once. While we stressed several times that we wanted everything to come separately so we could enjoy the food and beer at our own pace, all of our food came at once, and very shortly after we ordered. Uncool. A table full of cheese, frites, and burgers, getting cold before we could get to it all; not the leisurely dining experience we wanted at all. When we complained, we were told that the dishwasher was broken and they were trying to push food out as quickly as possible. What?? So basically you're telling me you're purposely trying to push customers out the door as quickly as possible? If I wanted fast food, I would've gone to McDonald's. To make matters worse, our waitress immediately took our beer menu away; guess I'm not having another drink? And even though we complained, nothing was done to make it right--nothing comped, no discount, and frankly, a very insincere apology. WTF? Brasserie V?! If kitchen issues kept you from providing the quality dining experience I've come to expect from your establishment, you should not have opened.	1
This place is where all of the youngsters of ktown come to chill at. The waiters come quickly with all the food you need. I tried lots of korean bbq place in ktown and the valley, but this is one of the top 5 on my list. The cost is worth the meat. But the bad thing is, since its so popular there is a bit of wait time. Other than that, i love it...	1
Been here a few times and it&#39;s been ok... Today not so much.<br><br>Ordered drinks which were fine except that we were never asked if we wanted another round. Our server was pretty much mia after taking our drink and food order.<br><br>Then we had a nice 50 min wait before we got any food. Let&#39;s Not forget the fact that no one in the restaurant came to check up on us or offer us new drinks during those 50 min! I had to get up find our server (who is apparently the manager) and complain. <br><br>The food came out 10 min later ....and surprise surprise it was cold! Cold eggs for bfast!? No thanks! <br><br>He took off 2 of the meals and comped the drinks which was cool, but once again we didn&#39;t see him after he gave us our check. This is was the worst service, food and overall experience! Never going back...	0
Grade: B-	1
The service was slooooow and sporadic. We sat for almost 15 minutes at our table before the waitress even came by to say hello. While ordering, the waitress kept trying to push additional items with each one I ordered. (I lost count of how many time she asked if we wanted sweet and sour pork). The food was okay. The ginger crab had very little edible meat. The walnut prawns were actually the tastiest dish we ordered. I would give it another try, but my first visit was not impressive.	0
Lunch: around noon (12:30-3:30) but they also save leftover if you run too early or late. Food tasts realy fresh and amazing. Great cakes (some are vegan) and a nice place to buy food and more healthy product.	1
Grade: B+	1
Old school pastrami Ruben sandwich is Good and the servers all know the history of Canters .	1
The cereal could have been a little crisper but the shot and milkshake paired together perfectly.	1
My wife and I were looking for a place with a patio to celebrate our anniversary. Cantina Laredo has two.  Unfortunately, the rain kept us from sitting outside, but the wait staff were awesome and the food was excellent!	1
Let&#39;s start with that my review is biased. This place holds some good thoughts for me. With that said, it is charming. In the middle of nowhere off Northern sits Paper Factory with its different character and decor. Mundo is for tapas so the portions are small but it wasn&#39;t disappointing, although we did move on from here to a full dinner elsewhere. It has a different feel to it from everything Queens and it is well recommended if you&#39;re looking for a quaint little place for date night over a glass of wine. Or two.	1
I really wanted to like this place. I had high hopes because it's open late and walking distance from my apartment. But, it was just terrible. I ordered Kao Moo Dang (roasted red pork & chinese sausage over white rice). First of all, watched them microwave it right in front of me.. and it was really just gross. Even the chinese sausage, which are pretty hard to mess up, were below average and only edible when doused with their sauce. Would've given no stars but the girl who put together my order was really sweet. I'm hopeful that I just ordered the wrong thing, maybe I should go back for the curry sometime. I hate to be hater!	0
I was there this week....the food was amazing!!! Very nice atmosphere ... Nice music , defiantly be a regular spot!!!<br>Must visit.	1
What happened! The old location was friendly fast and yummy! My daughter and I came in for lunch and were ignored while we observed all the tables with Indian Men were visited by waiters frequently. Our glasses were never refilled and we had to go ask for service. The food was ok but service was awful! We ended up going to the front to ask for our check. We waited over 10 minutes before they came to check out and pay. It was off hour and not busy. We did not feel welcomed and will not be back. Would NOT recommend!!!	0
I loved everything about Brooklyn bowl accept the food but it was at great experience overall.	1
I've stopped at La Brea Bakery at Downtown Disney for a fruit cup or at LAX for a chicken sandwich, but I wanted to try the real thing. Service was excellent and everything looked amazing! The cheese selection was a nice touch and the pastries were very tempting. I tried the pretzels because I friend had recommended them and they were fabulous. I also bought an artichoke sandwich that was to die for; it had tons of spinach, chevre and I believe pesto on it as well. The man at the counter answered all of my questions and overall it was a great experience.	1
Called at 4 they said they would not be open till 6. Called at 6 said they would not be open till 7. Called at 7:10 they said they would not be open till tomorrow. No reason just the typical customer anti-service one can expect from these people. GIVING UP.	0
I have been a big fan of Canter's going back to the 80's. We used to race here after a night out to eat and get those last drinks before 2 am. Well, even when I didn't live here anymore I traveled back regularly and would always stop at Canter's. Bagels and Lox platter, Potato Knish, Blintzes, Reuben, it's all great! And the waitresses are just as friendly and helpful as ever. It has pained me to drive by without stopping a few times lately... on my way to an appointment. But we enjoyed a nice Sunday brunch the other day finally. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is that both the restaurant cashier and the bakery cashier just kept repeating to sign the CC check, "when you're ready", over and over like robots. We were talking and/or looking or something, and it was not busy, and there was no line behind us. We heard you the first 2 times. Anyway, still enjoying the baked goods we took with us. Will be back soon, with cash. Pics... 	1
Well....if I ever had a chance to taste the food then maybe, just maybe I could have added some stars. I stopped in, was greeted by the hostess and then seated at the bar. I sat there for 15-20 minutes completely ignored. Wow...not even something to the effect of &#34;we&#39;ll be with you as soon as we can.&#34;...nope nothing. The vibe I got was that they are too cool for school. That attitude needs to change or you won&#39;t be around no matter how good your food is.<br><br>When telling the hostess that I couldn&#39;t wait anymore, the offered up excuse was &#34;we only have one server working.&#34;...at 1130am on a weekday in the West Loop? That&#39;s hilarious.	0
Floors smell like urine. Can&#39;t understand why this place gets any customer&#39;s. Dirty tables, fly&#39;s, this place is just nasty. Sorry, I had to give it 1 star. Huell Houser, you owe me one. You&#39;re a very bad man!	0
not the best but definately the best out west in Kendall. The layout of the place gives it space and the owner is friendly.<br>the quality of the ingredients clearly show in everything you eat but i wish it just tasted a little more mom and pop&#39;s for being such a little market/cafeteria style spot.	1
how excited was i when i saw the sign for a vietnamese sammich shop to open up on fillmore? very excite!i work nearby, sometimes, and i try to bring my lunch, because as we all know, the neighborhood is not so cheap! forgetting to pack food from home, i walked over to bun mee on my lunch break and ordered the roast pork sandwich. i was already annoyed with the hefty price, but thought "maybe the TASTE is amazing + worth it."nope.15+ minutes later, i took the goods back to work and couldn't wait to sink my teefs into the sandwich. what a disappointment. the meat was bland. more fat than meat. the sauce didn't help at all. and after eating it, i was still hongray. and my banh mi craving had not been satiated.for the rest of the work day, all i could fantasize about was getting a delicious sammich from lee's (saigon sanwiches would be closed by the time i left work) to make up for the bun mee disappointment. as soon as i punched out, i drove straight to lee's. mmmmmm. tummy happy.i might try another sandwich from bun mi, just because it's in the neighborhood. perhaps the chicken, so i don't have to pull chunks of fat from my mouth, mid-chew. and it'll kill me to pay that much for a sandwich that might leave me hungry! :/i do have to say, the home-made cookies were delish. as was the strawberry-lychee agua fresca (i tried some from my co worker). maybe the other dishes are tasty as well.we'll see.	0
I got the Margarita for $8. Sauce is very sweet and tastes like something generic from a can. Service pretty terrible. Very cute inside. I&#39;ll prolly try it again sometime, bc it&#39;s so close to my house, but overall it&#39;s a poor man&#39;s Franny&#39;s.	0
Alright, I thought Burrito Drive was always more potential than actual deliciousness the first few times I ordered; that was probably because I tried to make my own burrito, which was fine. I also got some chorizo tacos once, which were also fine.	0
Though a rainstorm had cooled the city, it was still quite humid, but still the restaurant chose to open all the sliders. There was no air conditioned space. Thankfully there was a small breeze, so it became a lovely evening, with only two other tables occupied on a Thursday evening.For the number of patrons, we were over served, but, our every need was met promptly and without request from us. Very attentive staff, with doors held, and chairs pushed in. Glasses never empty, warm bread, delicious oil, appetizers prompt, and entres hot; it was a surprising treat, and one we hope to return to again.	0
This was our 2nd time in 3 weeks.  We really enjoy how fresh the food is.  This is our new Italian restaurant.	1
I finally tried Apple Pan and loved their hickory burger. I was a little skeptical because I am usually not a hickory sort of person, but this burger was really tasty. They do put a big pile of ketchup on the burger so I&#39;d probably ask for only a little next time. I also split some fries with my friend, which came out piping hot. I love this diner where the food is served up quickly. Next time I&#39;ll save room for a slice of pie.	1
I could have cooked a better meal. Were running late, so had pork belly starter and lobster and mac. Lobster obviously frozen and was past peak of freshness. Pork belly was just that: pork belly. I have had elsewhere and it was superbly flavored - not so here. Can;t say anything about the rest of the menu, but the woman at the neighboring table had similar thoughts about her dish, braised pork shank and ate little of it. Our server was outstanding!	0
Food: 2 stars	1
First time there.  Look more like a take out restaurant but food was pretty good.  Would go there again.	1
We chose Seasons 52 to celebrate our daughter's 28th birthday as we like the seasonal menu, ambiance and 475/dish calorie limit.  There were people waiting, but we made reservations through Open Table and were seated immediately at a lovely large round booth overlooking a very attractive bar.Our server, Oreste, was excellent, suggesting appetizers, flatbreads and entrees. We asked him for  a wine selection and he appropriately asked for price range and helped us choose a nice bottle of Pinot Grigio  to fit our entrees. The scallops and branzano were excellent as usual and the trout continues to be the best you can find, perfectly grilled and seasoned. All the entrees always arrive at the perfect temperature and stay warm throughout the meal ( how do they do it?). At the end of the meal, we were astonished when Oreste brought   four glasses with champagne  for a birthday toast. Each  glass had a couple ounces and a nice raspberry. What a classy touch! Oreste then brought out a tower of desserts in a small glasses. It had a small birthday candle on top for our daughter to make a wish and blow out.  It was all done subtlely so we could have a private celebration and not cause a stir  in the restaurant. The desserts were good and the perfect size to finish the meal. If you need a place to celebrate a special occasion with class  and super food and service , this is it .	0
Wow. The food here is so over-salted and oily its hard to eat. The pasta was sitting in a 1 inch deep pool of oil. The Chick Marsala was so dry it was crumbling. No knife needed. The server straight up forgot my soup, but it was still on the bill. Bad food not worth half the price. Service with an attitude. Not sure how it has gotten so many good reviews, but i would not suggest it, or go back.	0
Honestly, if my friend hadn&#39;t had a tasty meal, I might have gone lower than 2 stars. This place just isn&#39;t for me as I had one of the worst meatball subs I&#39;ve ever had. Just nothing really good about it. Maybe they do more with the more advanced plates but if you can&#39;t even nail a meatball sandwich, I have my concerns. <br>I still might go back to try out the Alligator meatballs or one of the pasta dishes but I&#39;m in no rush.	0
Just ate here today for brunch and it was totally not worth the hour and a half wait we had to endure. After spending all that time outside waiting in the cold weather hoping that the food was worth the wait I was shocked to find that we waited that long for food that was pre prepared, extremely bland food and was kept under heat lamps. So not only is the nothing special but its not even fresh. To be fair we didn't spend much money for it. Fifteen bucks for all you can eat but still our day would have been much better spent staying home and preparing something. That would not have cost us a dime.So if you like restaurants that make you wait an extremely long time then serve you bland mediocre food this is the place for you. Otherwise go somewhere else	0
I love the idea of Perch! My Bestie, friends and I came here for my birthday and toasted with champagne at midnight :) <br>the combination of the spectacular night view and amazing company made it such a special night. The only problem I had was waiting to get in. The security guy was seriously power tripping. There were hardly any people outside and yet he insisted on making our group wait in the friggin cold before letting us in. Douche.<br>Despite the toolbag, I loved the chill atmosphere of the rooftop. It was slightly crowded by the bar, and most of the seats near fire pits or heaters were taken, but we eventually got seats. This is somewhere I&#39;ll definitely be going back to for special nights out!!	1
Great ambiance to hang out and live music. The live music is a good thing and a bad thing since it tends to be live and you feel rude talking over the music.	1
And they were good! The soup special was tortilla soup. I have had tortilla soup before, but never one like this! It was like eating a taco, but it was all puree. My wife loved it, and she is from AZ, so she is tough on all food Mexican. We both had the burgers, which were great! Their fries were good too. They were the skinny house-made kind. My wife also had the mac and cheese, which was very good! I highly recommend everything I tasted!The decor was great! The place looked brand new! They had these funky turquoise alligator skin seats, that while I would never have them in my house, they fit the place perfectly.  The whole place seemed to be brand new, and the bar back-splash was a waterfall. We were there on a Wednesday, so the place wasn't crowded. But with that atmosphere, I could see the bar being packed on a Friday or Saturday. The service was great, but the place was pretty empty. I got the impression that the service wouldn't drop off even if it was.	0
Let's get the facts down. This place has been open for so damned long it's practically a monument to the good ol' days of Los Angeles before the skyscrapers, credit cards, douchebags, and expensive parking and horrendous traffic. And smog.It's cash only, but they have an ATM.Parking across the street for it specifically is $2. Two dollars, even when they require validation, in a city where half-a-block or even next door to that lot can be anywhere from $10 to $50 on a game night.Yes, it's a bit pricey. But damn, is it good and filling. The milkshakes are plentiful and made from real ice cream. The food is hearty. The cole slaw is amazing. Don't get me wrong, I don't like cole slaw. I can barely take a side salad if I don't have something to add to the flavor. But their cole slaw is the king of slaws. I would fill up alone on that if I didn't realize I had other food coming. Granted, there are times when the food isn't great or worth the price, but just for the sheer staple of the place, I would pay for it. We got to sit at the counter the last time we visited, and ain't no one get to sit at the counter most of the time. Usually it's regulars with a line for the counter out the door. But, gurl, I'm tellin' you. We got sit at the counter like we was somebody, and it felt great. Until the other obnoxious patrons showed up.Pro Tip: The menu is on the wall. Much easier to update a few chalkboards than reprint menus daily.Look, I could care less about what you think of the place. I adore it, and no amount of human stupid is going to change that. Yes, I tipped our counter waiter $10 even though he lost our bill and had to wait on other demanding idiots. He was doing his best given the circumstances.Now I want cole slaw.	1
Very romantic. Sit outside by the fireplace.From the outside looks like a ghetto joint...once you walk in you realize the place has an amazing charm to it.Love the food too. try the steak and fish any time, and the mushroom and calmari they have at this kitchen is amazing.Great wine selection as well, but the main draw here is the scenery. Loved the seashells and candles everywhere.	1
This place would do much better with a new manager and wait staff. It has the makings for a great restaurant and dining experience and you can't beat the location. The food is OK to Good, but the service is horrible. We've been 4 or 5 times. We keep hoping it will get better, but it never does. The service is incredibly slow, the waiters are not friendly, super slow, they forget things, they're always rushed and never apologize, and so on. If the prices were more reasonably, it wouldn't be as big a deal. But for what they charge, the service should be much better and more in line with the food. Time to let the manager and wait staff go. Oh, and they also need to have more than one server working at a time! Please make this place work. I really want you all to succeed, but you have to make some changes!!	0
So, I&#39;ve lived in the area for quite some time, and was a frequenter of Life Cafe as it stood....<br><br>I would say that this is a nice new sheen (the renovations look good) - but the gutting of the menu has been a shocker. Basically, the only mention in any articles said that it would be changed slightly - and even mentioned that they&#39;d save the vegetarian options, as well as add new ones. Sadly, this isn&#39;t the case. They no longer serve tempeh bacon as a side to be added to everything. They no longer have seitan tacos, now they have grilled vegetable tacos. These are things I suppose I could have put up with (even if myself and my friends were eating the damn things 3x a week) if they didn&#39;t try and slide in a &#34;vegetable platter&#34; main. They now have a main dish, that is comprised of your selection of 3 of their &#34;farm market&#34; sides. <br><br>Interesting? Absolutely fucking not. Making a meal of side dishes is something a vegetarian has to do whilst on holiday in countries that they do not hail from - not something worthy of being called a &#34;main&#34; or even a meal. Fuck off with that. <br><br>The only addition that was reasonable was the brunch menu that I ate the other day - which was a nice benedict with kale and potato, as well as soyrizo on a breakfast sandwich. <br><br>I guess you really wanted to ensure that anything but brunch should be avoided - which is disappointing. I have no reason to go here other than breakfast now. <br><br>Leaving on this note today after my 3rd visit since it&#39;s renovations - I had decided I could live with the changes - until - we were approached by our waitress out front of the restaurant because she thought we didn&#39;t leave her a tip. We were a table of 6, and 20% gratuity was added to our check. She stuttered and was seemingly rather upset - even though we had paid the gratuity - which leads me to believe one of two things;<br><br>1) She expected that her service (which wasn&#39;t over the top, just average) was worth more than 20% <br><br>OR<br><br>2) She was unaware that she was tipped based on a mandatory charge <br><br>Either way, I&#39;m not fucking impressed. If you actually are unhappy with 20% - you simply do not raise a fuss about it, and that would really infuriate me - OR - she&#39;s such an awful waitress that she doesn&#39;t realize she&#39;s charged us 20% because of her restaurant&#39;s (and practically every single one in the 5 boroughs) policy. <br><br>I&#39;d like to say I&#39;m going to return - but I&#39;m not, unless it&#39;s for brunch and it will be likely to be a begrudging choice. Thanks for ruining one of my favorite places, assholes!	0
Just went to Canter's this morning at about 2am, and dayumm....How is it that I have spent so much time in LA, practically my second home, and never enjoyed the late-night experience that is Canter's? I walked in with my buddy and immediately felt like I had entered a 1950s Jewish deli. The lighting over the dining area is so funky. I don't think I've ever seen such lighting before. Yes, i know, they are just colored pieces of plastic, but I was impressed.The service was spot-on, and the menu has everything I would want EXCEPT smoked sable. The prices are pretty standard for a Jewish eatery ($14/person) but it is well worth the price when you need 24/7 comfort food. I will surely be visiting Canter's again soon.	1
Stopped in on a business trip and was very happy to find all the positive reviews were right on. Nothing fancy, just good, simple Mexican food! Prices were great and the Negra Modelo was nice and cold. If you're in the area, Taqueria Guadalajara is a great choice.	0
This place is my favorite! It has a great energy and the perfect laid back cafe environment I&#39;m always looking for--perfect for doing some work or meeting a friend for a bite and coffee. The coffee is delicious and made to order by a knowledgable and charming staff--not to mention good looking! Also, once a month they host an awesome comedy show in the studio in the back with great stand up comics. You can always spot the owners walking around and making sure everything is up to snuff. In one word, this place is SPECIAL.	1
I really wish this was a Bostonian bar. Pronouncing &#34;Far Bar&#34; with a kamikaze Japanese accent just sounds so... racist. <br><br>It sucks when you and your friends can&#39;t agree on a bar because one person prefers wine while another prefers whiskey and another prefers beer and so on. Far Bar takes care of that with its awesome selection of pretty much everything. Seriously, they have something for everybody! Great selection of whiskey, cocktails, craft beer, wine, and even the (crappy) over-commercialized stuff... talk about a major win!<br><br>Happy hour, like others have mentioned, is golden. Burger and fries for $7? Yes ma&#39;am!	1
This is like a regular Chinese restaurant - regular chinese food, rude service, dirty silverware. I think people come here because it&#39;s cheap, but aren&#39;t there better options elsewhere in Chinatown that are equally as cheap?<br><br>I came for the 2 for $20 lobster special, and they were small and not that good. The roast duck was fine, but came out cold. If you do come, I would recommend the noodle soups or a stir fry veggie.	0
Oh, Bonsai... How I love you!<br><br>I have to admit: the first time I went, I wasn&#39;t very impressed. The decor is very beautiful, very stylish... but lord, is your seating uncomfortable! What to pick? Your hard, stiff plastic chairs? Or your low couches that make me sit with my back ramrod straight and my knees to my chest?<br><br>It didn&#39;t matter, because your Thai iced tea was fabulously refreshing and sweet!<br><br>Your owner happened to be sitting at the table next to ours, and so we started chatting away.. nice guy, great sense of humour, bit of a jokester... good times!<br><br>I have to admit: working as a massage therapist, you&#39;re broke half the time. What I love about you, Bonsai, is that you offer delicious rolls for comparable prices BUT... you also offer simpler rolls for steals! I usually do the cheaper rolls for takeout on my way home from work: the Spicy Crab Roll is absolutely fabulous, and last time I ordered it, it came out to about $6. Your Shrimp Tempura, JB Tempura, Atlantic... all of those for around $10... not bad!<br><br>If I dine in or have a little extra cash to spare, your Volcano Shrimp is outstanding... Baked Dynamite rules!<br><br>Beware, though: eel sauce and spicy mayo are extra! However, if you get a nice lady at the front desk when you pick up your order, she may swap out your ginger and wasabi (I eat neither) for a free tub of eel sauce.<br><br>All in all, a delicious sushi treat at affordable price if you really look. Sorry, Ruson! Bonsai kicked your butt!	1
A stunning view combined with great live jazz makes for a pretty good evening.	1
There were seven of us for brunch on a Sunday at 12:30. Cool venue, alright food. I had the egg frittata and it was a little dry. The bloody mary may or may not have had alcohol. Felt a little rushed at the end even though we kept ordering tons of drinks after we finished eating. I probably won&#39;t go back.	0
I think I fell in love with DTLA the very first time my friend took me here. The rooftop view is breathtaking; I was hypnotized by the city lights. I think my subconscious decided that night that I would be moving to L.A... and voila. Here I am. Thanks, Perch!<br><br>Take 2 elevators to get to the top... and one more to get higher. The view, the view, the view. Perfect lighting, fireplaces, plenty of seating. Great place to enjoy a drink and lounge around, but an even more spectacular place for a sit-down dinner (along with drinks too of course). Seriously, make dinner reservations and have dinner.. ESPECIALLY on a Friday/Saturday night. You will avoid the annoying line and get to enjoy amazing food at a table overlooking the view. THEN after you can mix in with the crowd and continue to get your drink on. (You&#39;re welcome).<br><br>Classy, slightly pretentious crowd but not to the point of disgust. Relaxed. Perfect place to go to when I want an excuse to get dressed to the nines... which is always ;) lol. <br><br>Highly recommend: <br>+POT-AU-FEU<br>+Truffle poutine<br>+Squash gnocchi<br>+PORK BELLY	1
i tried the spicy potato soup (gamja tang) and it was pretty good.filled with meat, half a potato, and perilla/sesame leaf (which i think is a MUST in gamja tang.)the rice comes in the stone pot thing, which is nice.yum.	1
Food was excellent, chicken was very soft. The server I think her name is soraya is amazing, she&#39;s so nice and attentive. Makes me wanna come back. And I will. You have to try it. :)	1
I definitely won&#39;t be running back to Root &amp; Bone. While the biscuits were great everything else left something to be desired. The fried chicken wasn&#39;t crispy, the macaroni and cheese was liquidity and mushy and the pork belly bacon was severed in a puddle of grease. The portions are fairly small and for a party of 2 the bill after tip was a few dollars short of $100. If you&#39;re having a friend chicken craving try Sweet Chick and Brooklyn Star, sorry Root &amp; Bone!	0
Not a Yelper by trade and have never taken a picture of a plate of food but my Valentine&#39;s Day experience at The District (and corresponding hit to the cash line of my personal balance sheet) has compelled me to write a review.<br><br>I echo everything that Johanna W. and Arthur G. say for this place and will add a couple of more thoughts. I ordered the sea bass with crispy skin. The fish which was supposed to be flaky and buttery was overcooked and almost certainly frozen shortly before hitting my cold plate. No crispy skin to be found. I actually sent this little disaster back in favor of the lobster noodle bowl which was the sole high note of the dinner. Everything before and after that was terrible. <br><br>I would not be so critical if this was $45 bucks per person, but for $95, I expected way more. Not sure how this place is two dollar signs $$. Also, not sure what dream world folks live in who enjoyed this V-day prefix &#39;meal&#39;. 5 stars? Are you the same 8% of the country that approve of the job Congress is doing? I digress.	0
This place is nothing compared to Ippudo even if there&#39;s more stuff on the menu. My friends and I ordered the ramen, 3 different type of prok buns, sushi and it&#39;s nothing even near California and Ippudo. <br><br>The service was friendly and I like the fact that you can make your resevratons on Yelp. But when it comes to the food, it wasn&#39;t all that great and they gave my friend old Jameson.. or was it even Jameson?<br><br>We spent over $100 between 4 of us and I didn&#39;t feel like it was worth our money. I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ll be coming back on my next NY visit..	0
I recommend this place to everyone as the best burger joint around.The only reason why i give it 4 stars is because its pretty up there in price. I know its a gourmet burger, but i wanna eat this everyday and with a burger ranging from $10-15, I cant always afford that. The pastrami mami is the craziest juciest, best burger that ever went into my mouth. soooooooooo yummos!! =) mmmMMMMmmmm just writing this review wants me to go there now and eat.anyways Please try it out and you'll know exactly what Im talking about.	1
So. Delicious.	1
Good brunch spot in mid-town. On Memorial Day, the wait was about 45 minutes. I am unsure of what time it would be on a weekend, probably long. I got the pastrami hash (SUPER greasy) and my husband got the Southern Egg plate (comes with cheese grits, biscuits, eggs, and fried green tomatoes). <br><br>I would NOT recommend the hash just because it was so greasy. It tasted good, but I was immediately grossed out once I saw the 1 centimeter pool of oil it was sitting in at the bottom of the bowl. G-R-O-S-S. The apple cinnamon butter that came with our dishes&#39; was delicious though.<br><br>My husband&#39;s dish was a-OK, the highlight were the cheese grits. <br><br>I would be willing to try this place again, but since both our dishes were mediocre, I&#39;ll probably try a different brunch place.	0
Yes the place is nice but was a disapointed with the food.Tamalito appetizer: a bit gummy but decent. Tomato puree sauceChilaquiles: Same tomato puree sauceEnchiladas: OLD smelly chicken and the same freaken tomato puree sauce...I really wanted to like this place but don't think I will be going back any time soon.	0
Breakfast is tasty delight!!! I ate here three times during my stay (twice for breakfast though all three meals were breakfast items). Day 1: Egg and Sage sandwich for lunch was so tasty. The sauce was a hollondaise-type of sauce which added a yummy creaminess to the sandwich. I wish the bread was just a little thinner, but better thick than thin. Day 2: The Big Breakfast: scrambled eggs with avocado and hash browns (delicious). Orange juice is fresh (not squeezed on site, but from local source). Day 3: The Ricotta pancakes...wow. This is perfect for two people to share. Delicious sweet and filling breakfast with fruit on top. The servers are pretty quick and friendly, we waited a little while for our food the last day but great timing otherwise. The menu for lunch/dinner is not quite a good as breakfast, so I recommend this place really for breakfast/brunch only.	1
Another great experience at Bacios.  Always enjoy going there.  Food, service, etc. always top notch.	1
a &#39;ramen&#39; bar with VERY LIMITED ramen options. <br>i ordered the pork one. think i managed 3 mouthfuls. <br><br>the calamari, on the other hand - prob one of the best i&#39;ve ever had. <br><br>in a strip mall. <br><br>if it leaves a bad taste in your mouth - you can pop into the pinkberry across the street afterwards.<br><br>:(	0
Well worth the hunt for parking! Flavorful scrambles AND...sweet potato fries!! Waitress wasn't the happiest but it didn't ruin the atmosphere or comfy couch dining.	1
We had our wedding reception at the cafe, and it was a wonderful evening. Thanks to the guys for making it so special.	1
I've been wanting to try this place for awhile, maybe because I'm always in search for the perfect bowl of ramen. Also, every time I walk by it always looks so busy! Alas, not impressed. I'm saddened that ramen does not come with a soft boiled egg by default, it should! Hence the star rating. Also, the chasu was uber mediocre. Here is my rating of ramen that I've had so far in SF, from left to right with left being the worse:Doraku - saiwaii ramen - genki - ken ken - katanaya - sozaiStill in search for the perfect ramen, similar to Toto in NYC.	0
I would give this place 4 1/2 stars because it is better than 4 but not quite 5. If you love Riesling, this is definitely the place to go. I don&#39;t think I have ever seen a Riesling list this long! There are still plenty of other varietals in red and white, so if you are not partial to Riesling don&#39;t worry - there will be something for you. <br><br>They really do have a great happy hour but it is exactly an hour, which makes me not as happy. The menu has a reasonable selection of noshes. I wish their red wines by the glass weren&#39;t served quite as warm as they were. <br><br>The atmosphere is comfortable, with knowledgable and friendly staff. The crowd seemed to be professionals without being &#34;suits&#34; and the music was good. It is a little off the beaten path but worth a trip for sure.	1
We went with our baby this week and watched as the staff lit a cigarette and put it in the incense holder. We promptly demanded that they put it out out of respect for the law (and our baby) and they acted like they had no clue it was illegal. We used to love it here but no more! Terrible terrible.	0
This place is so great I almost don't want to write about it to tell others. This is the bar where you and more than a few of you and your friends can commandeer a section for the night and just have to with your bad selves. They have a great outdoor area that will remind you of that time you went to New York that one weekend. But that doesn't stop them from having some flaming blue monstrosity of a drink whose name I did not care to remember. Not a scene just yet, so plan on going with a group. The staff is beyond cool which makes up for any shortcomings from the music selection which can be quite erratic. Smoker Friendly!	1
I read a few of the reviews and I&#39;ve noticed that several of them complain about the size of the restaurant. It&#39;s a VERY well known fact that this place is TINY (seating capacity of roughly 20-25) and you will almost always have to wait for seats to open up. If you come as a group of more than 3, you&#39;ll have to be willing to split up unless you want to wait for a really long time. If anything, you can always order take-out.<br><br>The reason why I like this place is the UNIQUE dining experience on top of the quality of the food. It feels like a 1980s burger joint; customers sit around the counter and the servers are decked out in white aprons and hat. The registers are old fashioned too! <br><br>I ordered the Hickory burger + fries + Cream soda. It wasn&#39;t cheap, but I felt it was one of those LA dining experience I had to have while I&#39;m living in LA. It&#39;s fast food, but the restaurant isn&#39;t just one of the &#34;usual fast food restaurants.&#34; Not to mention Apple Pan is unique to LA. The size of the burger was perfect for me (about the same as an In-N-Out burger). The quality of the meat was good and I really liked their original sauce! My friend had been there before and told me to get the hickory sauce for my fries...yummmm! They give you one of those paper cone cups in a metal stand for your drink; I didn&#39;t know they existed! My friends and I decided to get a whole pie to go for dessert at my place; they ran out of the banana cream pie, so we had to go with the apple. It comes with a caramel sauce; the pie was ok.<br><br>Overall, I had a positive experience -- good service, good food, what more can I ask for? I&#39;ll probably be back some time in the future, although not often. I want to try the banana cream pie, which my friend raves about.	1
I don't get what the hype is about this place. It's always so crowded, and the food is boring and overpriced. I had a 12 dollar ceasar salad that was just lettuce (with a little bit of water at the bottom of my bowl-gross!) I had a bite of my boyfriend's steak sandwich, which was pretty good but nothing special. The two stars is for the cute location and delicious drinks. Also, it's almost impossible to get a table.	0
Excellent food. The garlic rolls are delicious, soft rolls with gooey cheese and hearty portions of garlic! <br><br>We had the Italian sausage sandwich which was delicious and nicely spicy. The pasta with butter, parm and pepper was delicious. A little dry but probably because we ordered to go. <br><br>Small cheese pizza had 6 large square slices and my daughter, the cheese pizza expert was very happy with her dinner. <br><br>The cheesecake was delicious. It&#39;s a softer cheesecake, with scrumptious raspberry syrup and graham cracker crust.	1
Walked really far to get to the so called utopia of potatoes and when I get to the door it&#39;s locked with two guys eating inside. I stood there for a little trying to get the staffs attention but nobody gave me time of day. This utopia turned out to be a mirage and now I&#39;m starving at 2am	0
I hate this place, my friends from work always insist on going there but the place is just nasty dirty looking. Today I ordered the Fetuccini something de bosco and found some roach looking bug in it! Never again will i step foot in there.	0
I used to work around the area and would love to have breakfast and lunch from this place , it&#39;s good quality food and love the prices . I miss this place :(	1
First off, the view and ambiance is truly amazing! But, anyone can provide a great location and ambiance, it was Kayla&#39;s excellent service and hospitality that truly made my experience worth while! She was warm and inviting without being too scripted! I&#39;m a service trainer at another restaurant so I truly critique servers performance. She was amazing! <br><br>The food and drinks were also great! Go for the Lolita if you&#39;re into vodka. If you&#39;re more of a cognac person you have to try the One Night In Paris!!	1
Please, please and please, bring back the Sopes!!!!	1
Literally for years now, I have been hearing about the famous Sarussi Sandwich, so on Sunday, while running an errand in this area, and being quite hungry, I convinced my peeps to come in and find out for ourselves about this place. <br>Not disappointed at all, the &#34;original&#34; sandwich is huge and loaded, lots of meat and pretty good as well. <br>I also had the churrasco sandwich, and it definitely holds it own. Just ask them to hold the cheese. <br>Sarussi is definitely high up there as a good sandwich place.	1
A haiku review: Nice outdoor seatingHuge menu, choices: plentyGreat spot for your brunch	1
Best ramen I have ever had. Staff was extremely friendly and helpful in ordering our dishes! Can't wait to go back!	1
Our table was wobbly, 5 servers and nobody bothered to mention &#34;hey that table will practically flip your drinks across the room&#34;. The service was flippant and dumb, attitude without the experience to even justify their snottiness. Hardly any acknowledgement from the servers and multiple security guards, we moved an unoccupied barstool over to our table a whole 3 feet away and we were penetrated with the iciest of glares from 2 of the female servers. They didn&#39;t ask us to move it back nor was anyone in need of it so what&#39;s the big fucking deal? $20 for 2 beers and vodka with cranberry, not outrageous for a big city but I got much better drinks for less than that throughout that weekend. It&#39;s a real shame because the look of the place is so charming that I thought I had found a new favorite but I would rather go back to King Eddy and risk tuberculosis than go back here.	0
Table of 4.  The Rib eye was tough and chewy.  Minimal flavor.  The paparadelle was cold.  The rest of the food was great.Disappointing given the $$$$$	1
Sadly, I must retract my former "rave review" for Waterbar. After an absolutely outstanding lunch experience, a few months ago, we returned for dinner, on a quiet, rainy Wednesday night. To say we were disappointed is an understatement. Service was deplorable. With a reservation, and the room only moderately busy, we waited 30 minutes for anyone to come to our table, another 30 minutes to order and ANOTHER 30 minutes for the first course to arrive. The entire meal took 2 1/2 hours and, while we were not in a hurry, the long lags were absolutely irritating, especially since we could often see our plates sitting forever on the warming shelf. Our server had no personality, was rarely seen, and we had to beg several times to even order a bottle of wine. Forget about requesting a second basket of bread! In fact, the only time he smiled or really interacted with the table was when the desert came. The timing, just before the bill, (which we also had to wait for), made us laugh. The food? Mediocre. The chowder, which previously was the best I'd ever tasted, was bland, watery and uninspired. The rest was completely bland and unmemorable. Finally, they apparently started cleaning the kitchen, while the room was still half full. In addition to all the clanging, the entire place was filled with a strong, foul fish odor that was so unpleasant that we scurried to leave. We dropped $500, for a party of 4, entertaining friends on a special occasion. We left completely embarrassed that we had selected Waterbar.	0
We are a 5 minute walk away from Market Table and have tried to come twice for dinner. Both times we&#39;ve given a LOCAL phone number and put our name down for a table, and both times we&#39;ve never received a phone call letting us know when our table was ready. Really disappointing!	0
We had a party of 4 and Elaine took very good care of us! A couple people got the Shrimp &amp; Grits and were pleased, 0 got the special with Striped Mahi (I think) and I got the house special Grouper...delicious! The Grouper will easily have me coming back!	0
This place is great! We went there for fun since our last name is Takara, but are so happy we went. The service was fantastic and the food was even better! We had the gyoza (potstickers) to start and I had the Takara fried rice while my husband had the original ramen bowl. All three were delicious, but the gyoza was probably the best I&#39;ve had.	1
Loves the burrito drive! Be sure to order a specialty burrito, if you try to build your own you'll just screw it up! The braised pork and shamena burritos are favorites at our house. An order of chips is enough for one person. Probably skip the chips and dip - the bean dip isn't very good and the amount of guac you get is not worth the price.	1
We tried the hibachi side of this resturant &amp; Chef Andy was great! The basic hibachi was satisfying enough for me w/o the added meat options. $9 for soup, salad, stir fry veggies, fried rice or noodle &amp; entertainment! Hubs had teryaki salmon which he loved but could have been bigger of course. Fun for kids too, be sure to purchase their Groupon.	1
My new favorite neighborhood Italian restaurant! Everything was perfect from start to finish. The owners were so welcoming and attentive that you felt at home. I sampled two wines before choosing the &#34;rafaelo&#34; Sangiovese which went perfectly with my penne zucca e pachetta! Pasta is homemade and sauce isn&#39;t overbearing or too greasy. Just all around wonderful! Family and date night friendly. Will be coming back soon!	1
My friend and I came here after her fantasizing about how amazing the dumplings are here. I&#39;d heard that Vanessa&#39;s was a dumpling force to be reckon with through other sources as well so I was keen to see what it was all about.<br><br>My friend, being a dumpling fanatic in general, ordered three different kinds of dumplings and the duck pancake. We dug in, and as she sank her teeth into the pancake she mentioned how it tasted a little &#34;off&#34;. I decided to skip it, being that I don&#39;t really eat meat in general. We finished everything and went on our way. I wasn&#39;t mesmerized by the experience but I was impressed by how popular this joint was. At 7 p.m. it was already jam packed. I also liked the Bring Your Own Beer aspect (there needs to be more of that in NYC).<br><br>That night, my friend and I went to bed and at 2 a.m. she became violently ill. She spent the entire night vomiting up dumplings, sour meat and alcohol and unfortunately forever altering her love affair in a long standing relationship with dumplings. Food poisoning is the last thing you want on a trip. I&#39;m sorry Vanessa&#39;s - but it&#39;s a no, no.	0
Haven&#39;t been to Kaba Curry for a long time. The last time was when they were at the food court on Charleston. It was finally getting cold here in Vegas, so it was the perfect time to eat curry and visit the new location. I&#39;m glad that they have an actual restaurant now, because let&#39;s be honest here, that food court was deserted and kind of sad. I was a little disappointed not to see the friendly faces of Anthony and Maki when we walked in. They were always present at the old location. <br><br>The menu had changed quite a bit, but in a good way. It was nice to see more options for sides and toppings, as well as some new desserts. Now you can also choose spice levels, which doesn&#39;t apply to me since I stay away from spicy foods, but I know that people like to have the option.<br><br>The restaurant was clean and spacious. The employees were friendly and attentive. Our food came out quickly and the Chicken Katsu was still as awesome as before. My only complaint? Well, maybe two. First, the temperature of the curry was disappointing. No, I don&#39;t want my curry to be boiling hot, but I definitely don&#39;t want it to be at room temperature either. Yes, it was that bad. I guess it was partly my fault because I could have complained. But on the other hand, I didn&#39;t know these employees. What if they got mad about me complaining and spit in my food? LOL totally kidding. But seriously, lukewarm curry does not taste good! This second one is more of a suggestion than a complaint. It would really be nice if they had brown rice as an option, even if there was an extra charge for it. <br><br>They have a &#34;frequent grubbers card&#34; so make sure you ask for one if they forget to offer it to you. <br>2 stamps = a free drink<br>4 stamps = a free side<br>7 stamps = a free meal!<br><br>I&#39;m hoping that we just went in on a off day. Winter is around the corner, so I will be back for sure!	1
Rude, instead of chasing us outside the door and asking us if we paid, how about you check the counter. We left cash (with tip)! <br><br>The place is quite small, and the happy hour menu is limited at best. Their wine selections look very good though.<br><br>Wouldn&#39;t come back.	0
Great beer.	1
Cute little Italian place with a great atmosphere and delicious food! We ordered the Burrata which just melts in your mouth and is deliciously paired with argula and a few slices of cured meat. My dish was the spaghetti with clams which was good, but I enjoyed my brother&#39;s pizza with mushrooms and truffle oil better (Di Porcini Tartufata). It was cooked perfectly with thin crust and amazing flavor. The carafe of Cabernet sauvignon was also yum! Cash only but there is an ATM inside the restaurant.	1
There&#39;s something about mom &amp; pop shops that i go crazy for. Viva Burger is a hidden gem in the Kendall Hammocks area. Everybody knows about McDonalds, Burger King, 5 guys etc., but people need to give places like Viva Burger a chance. Their meat is delivered fresh from a local butcher. They don&#39;t freeze their patties and they make everything else from scratch. I had the pleasure of trying their signature item; the Viva Burger. It&#39;s chorizo and beef mixed together and grilled with their special seasoning, grilled onions, lettuce, tomatoes and secret sauce. Absolutely amazing! If you&#39;re really hungry you can order the Viva Burger in the 1/2 pound. The family who runs the joint are the best people you will ever get to know. I&#39;ve had the pleasure of chit chatting with them for the 3 hours that I was there. They know their guests by first name and what they usually order. Not a lot of places are like that. Their beers are served under 30 degrees so each sip/chug burns so good. :) Follow them on instagram for any specials or events going on. I highly recommend this place and the people. I love VIVA BURGER!	1
After a movie, and feeling a little hungry, we called a cousin and she recommended the Bowery. The place is a chic, kinda upscale burger joint. It is a tiny place, and we walked past it twice. We almost decided to go to Magnolia instead, but then realized it was next door. And we are so glad we found it as it was worth it. The husband and I ordered the Bowery Burger after the cousin's recommendation. The burger came perfectly with blue cheese and between two toasted english muffins. The staff is friendly and attentive . The beer and wine selection is also great. I recommend this place if you're in the area.	1
Looking for a place to have any early dinner before Human Nature show!  This was a great choice. Wanted to sit next to the water but due to a party of 3 unable to do but was still a nice view.  Had the best tortilla chips with fantastic salsa and guacamole !  Highly recommend    Service was exceptional.	1
Stephen, our waitstaff, was very knowledgeable and steered us into some great choices.  We took advantage of the Special $65 for two, which included a bottle of wine, two entrees (from a long list to choose from), two salads of choice and a shared dessert.  My husband ordered a stuffed chicken which he enjoyed, I ordered the barramundi fish with Thai overtones.  Delicious.  House salads very very tasty.  Dessert of chocolate bread pudding good also.  We'll be back, thank you.  Oh yes, the pate of cookies offered as we wound up our evening was such fun and the icing on the cake.  Thanks to you all!	0
one of my favorite places in LA. best banana cream pie, the hickory burger is amazing, very affordable, egg salad sandwich is delicious, i can't pick a favorite! everything is so good! my only complaint would be the seating arrangements... you always have to wait for a seat. but it is totally worth it, the staff is really friendly and it has that old time vibe all around it. this is an LA must!	1
We go here every weekend. They really are too good to be true.	1
My first impression of Meltshop wasn&#39;t even about the food. It was about the prices. $13 got me a grilled chicken sandwich and tator tots. I normally don&#39;t like paying that much for lunch, especially since there are other places in the area where you can get more food for a little less. But I was overall pretty impressed with the food, that I&#39;ll consider going back, but probably will stick to the regular grilled cheese and not getting anything with beef or chicken. <br><br>My sandwich was decently sized, bread held up well, and the chicken was flavorful. It surprisingly got me full for being a small sandwich. The bread was also very tasty. However, my favorite thing about the meal were the tator tots. They were really crispy and the Parmesan topping adds to the flavor. The service was friendly and my wait time was pretty reasonable. I definitely want to try their shakes and their truffle grilled cheese when I come back.	1
I got take out from this place; it wasn&#39;t exactly bursting-in-your-mouth flavorful but definitely not bland either. It tasted... healthy. Which is how they&#39;re marketing themselves, so no big surprise there. I got the Pozole Roja soup and the Mahi curry. Both came in reasonable portion sizes and prices and were also conceptually quite refined, so I&#39;d recommend this place.	1
I'm leaving a lame review because the last time I ate there I was severely disappointed.I went there with my girlfriend and we ordered our dinner, and our waitress completely ignored us more of the evening. We saw our food get placed to be picked up and none of the food runners grabbed, nor our server. It sat there just staring at us and no one did anything besides look at the ticket and grab whatever was next to it.We had to eat our cold dreary meal, and we did NOT want to cause any drama so we just ate it and left.Unfortunately, I won't be going back.	0
Just left here. Ugh I wanted to like this place. Okay so upon walking in I automatically like the decor. Really cute place. I ordered the spicy chicken ramen. There was a hair in it so I sent it back. The waitstaff and the guy in the kitchen were super apologetic and I brushed it off because shit happens. I was given another bowl of ramen and dug in immediately. Broth was flavorful and hot, noodles were al dente just the way I like them, and the chicken was super tender. Then I found another hair. I didn&#39;t even mention this to the waitstaff because I didn&#39;t want to wait for ANOTHER bowl of ramen and hair doesn&#39;t gross me out that much (although c&#39;mon....get your shit together). My boyfriend and I decided to get some boba for dessert and what do you know...there was a hair on my boba cup. Seriously? Every single thing that I was served had a hair in it or on it. At that point I was furious, disgusted, and over it. And the boba tasted meh. Very very meh. Not worth $4 at all. When we got the check, I was so disappointed. I was hoping that a hair in my ramen (and basically everything else) would warrant a discount of some kind to save face. Nope. For a $17 a person meal this left a lot to be desired. Won&#39;t give them a second chance. Too bad too, they&#39;re right by me and this place seemed like it had a lot of promise.	0
Make Your Own Sushi Bowl has many delicious options!	1
This place always open and crowded. Crowded means food is yummy. Amazing customer service, whatever you request, they make it happen. Food yummy and whatever you order, cant go wrong. I had the pastrami dip a signature dish. Huge portions. Make sure you bring a big tummy. I have to go back again for desserts. My plate so huge, i didnt get to try the desserts. Soo many good desserts too!	1
I LOVE KYOCHON WINGS! I would love them even more if I didn't know that the Garden Grove location has been TOTALLY RIPPING ME OFF! At this location they count 2 parts of the wing as one piece. This whole time I've been paying about $1 for only a part of the wing -_-. This one is also a sit down place and they serve beer and give your ice cream after. I don't have to tell you how amazing the wings are because after reading this you should go find out for yourself. If you must read what I have to say though... look up my extensive chicken wing review for the other location ;]The fries here are good. Crispy seasoned wedge cut fries, kind of like BJ's Brewery. Honey mustard sauce with the popped-rice chicken strips are a must try, they're interesting! I didn't care for the Chicken Fried Rice it was a tad under-salted but had a lot of spice to it.Oh man I want Kyochon wings right now. 1/3 spicy flavored and 2/3 Ginger Soy to balance it out. Carpool here because parking sucks.	1
WOW!! Came here for the first time and after reading the reviews i thought lets give it a try!! I ordered and waited for 30 mins for my food! I evev asked for a frozen custard while i waiting, when i asked for my food they had totally forgotten about my order!! They asked me to wait! And after another five minutes they just gave me my money back with no food!! WHAT A FREAKING JOKE OF PLACE!!!!!!	0
YUM!!! I&#39;m a huge pho nut, and this place is by far the best pho I&#39;ve had in a LONG time!! They definitely don&#39;t skimp out on the meat...and their Thai iced tea is on point. Will definitely be back soon!	1
THE FOOD IS VERY NICE. THE PRESENTATION OF THE DISHES IS GREAT. THE RESTAURANT WAS VERY EMPTY BUT WE SPENT A GREAT EVENING.	1
Sit up at the bar enjoy the view & let the great food & drinks flow!	1
$2.25 for a can of diet coke?? &nbsp; Not cool.	0
really slow service, wait for 25 mins for a ramen!(its not crowded that time )and the ramen isn't very well, the one here before Takara is much more better.	0
Good dinner at monserrate restaurant	1
Stomach flu off of the carne asada quesadilla	0
Pros: unique food selection, nice decor, clean, decent beer and wine options, relaxing outdoor seating, very affordable, board games, big screen tv inside...<br>Cons: there are no waitresses...you need to get up and walk to the register every time you want another drink. There was a huge crowd of people blocking the door waiting to make orders...<br>Overall it&#39;s a nice, trendy place to have a good bite.	1
I love Canter's! I didn't discover it until 2003 or something, but I know I should have been here much earlier in my life. Upon initial viewing of the menu, items may seem a little expensive, but the portions match. I rarely leave the place without leftovers. The menu can be a little overwhelming too; there are a lot of items on it. But I think this is good, because everyone can find something they want to eat!One of the best things there, in my opinion, is the Matzo Ball Soup. The Matzo ball is huge and filling and delicious. It's so big, this soup does not come in a cup. Everything on the menu is very fresh. The Potato Pancakes come with sour cream and apple sauce (just the way good latkes are served!) and the half order is three of them, I think. If you have had a latke before, you know they are pretty filling. Quite honestly, I can't cover everything on the menu. It's just too much!More often than not, when I go, the servers have been older ladies. Whether they are Jewish or not, they seem like Jewish mothers: concerned that you are not eating enough or (maybe "and") somewhat surly. But I personally think that adds to the charm and authenticity of the place.The place is huge too. There are a lot of tables so I have rarely had to wait long to be seated. And it's open 24 hours! In LA that is a definite bonus. You can go to a concert or a club or what have you, and you will always have a great place to come eat after that isn't Denny's (because let's face it, Denny's isn't a place you go, it's a place you end up). Sometimes you'll even see celebrities there. Some are better sightings than others... I saw Andy Dick once; he walked out right behind us. We didn't say hi. :P	1
I was waiting for my Vamoose bus near Penn Station, and this was an EXCELLENT place to wait (as compared to Starbucks, Pret and the like)....<br><br>- great coffee<br>- friendly, cute guy<br>- pain du chocolate, which he warmed for me<br>- SUPER CLEAN venue<br>- LOTs of outlets <br>- Free password-only wifi<br>- nice, mellow music (blues, jazz, etc)	1
This place is so underrated. My dad and I are always looking for a free night to catch some of The Corner for dinner because we never leave dissatisfied. It started out as part of a mission to find really good macaroni (yes, the Corner has it & I don't remember why we were looking for it), and discovered a restaurant we would return to many times.We seem to be the only people who know how good it is, so we never have a wait & the waiters are very friendly and engaged with us. My dad likes to sneak peeks at the TV to catch the score of whatever game is on, and they have plenty all around. Very sporty, low key vibe. However... the food doesn't have a low key vibe at all. The food is awesome & well presented. Especially the salads. Who knew salads could be so pretty? The Flat Iron Steak Salad and the Sage Chicken Salad are delicious.Prices are very reasonable & portions are spot on. I'd go for an early dinner.	1
Great, creative menu items. Excellent beer list. Cool, casual ambience and very attentive service.	1
The server was very nice. Im a chef. I think the food can be better but service was excellent. The view was gorgeous. I drove from laguna beach to check out. We had the sashimi and the sweet potato gnocchi very good. But the poached turkey not so great. 5 star service.	1
The stuff of legend. I'm not a patient man so when it gets busier I wouldn't care to wait and fight for a seat at the counter. Once seated it probably took 15 minutes to order, eat and pay. I can appreciate that.The burger is delivered quickly and incredibly good. Not a fan of the relish they drop on the steakburger, but with experience I can now avoid that. The service is a bit curt, but the fast pace is what keeps it moving. Get here for lunch, turn back the clock and escape the pretension of everything else in life.	1
Ok I admit I made the reservation 10 days ago at 10am sharp by using the alarm, otherwise I would not be able to secure a spot right at dinner time 6:30. And I was informed as well it was going to be a long-lasting one, so well prepared myself with not too much food consumed at noon.<br><br>Every dish, as expected, was prepared with delicacy and kindness, and you can directly taste it out using palate. I especially enjoyed the duck and sea bass, which supposed to be their &#34;main&#34; courses. Their special duck confit mixed with lychee was one my most remarkable experiences.<br><br>Towards the end of meal, they will provide you the menu, so you can remember exactly what was explored at this top notch restaurant!<br><br>Don&#39;t know whether I will come back again here as we have so many choices in the city, yet this is definitely some places you gotta try out if you are someone exotic!	1
Good ambiance, service and food <br>Definitely recommend for group of friends or date. The waiter will recommend 3-5 dishes per person that is too much. For us a group of 4 we had 7 dishes and that was more than enough.	1
B A N A N A STHIS PIE ISBANANASB A N A N A SBut seriously. It's Bananas.The pie is at least. The Cream pie is amazingly good. Stuffed with lots of bananas in a great flaky crust. It's the best slice of banana cream pie I've had anywhere. The only way to explain it is to try it. So go, set forth, and try the banana cream pie, but keep in mind, cash only.So you're wondering what about the other food?It's just average. Nothing to write home about, and very overpriced. The only thing worth it is the pie. Go somewhere else for your main course and head over here for the pie, because it is bananas, and burgers are just plantain.	1
I only go here if I&#39;m going to Canyon Falls to buy a new weave or on my way to the cigar store...I&#39;ve never had good sushi here ...EVER... But the staff is nice.... But not nice enough to go back and fear I may got sick from old sushi ...,	0
I love a good hot dog. I love good fusion. Tokyo Doggie Style is the best of both of those food genres!<br><br>I went here during the DTLA Night Market, and after eagerly browsing the options online beforehand, Tokyo Doggie Style was the most intriguing choice. I was also going to the event with a pescetarian friend of mine, so the fact they had vegetarian options was a huge plus.<br><br>I ordered the Hurry Curry Chili Dog (a bit warily, I must admit - I wanted the Hawaiian option, but it was bacon wrapped and pork makes me queasy). I&#39;ve never been a huge &#34;curry&#34; person, to tell you the truth. But I&#39;d only tried the Thai and Indian versions of curry, and was delighted to discover Japanese curry is a much more subtle version of the other two. The chili on the hot dog was delicious. Combined with chopped bell pepper and hard boiled egg, it was the platonic ideal of hot dog fusion goodness. <br><br>My friend ordered the veggie dog and a side of takoyaki (a street food native to Osaka, she said), which she insisted I try. Though the idea of &#34;deep fried octopus balls&#34; as a basic description of a food item might&#39;ve scared some, it only piqued my foodie sense of curiosity. The takoyaki was delicious. Slightly sweet and super savory. I&#39;ll definitely order that next time.<br><br>Overall, if you like fusion, hot dogs, and really awesome Japanese street food, Tokyo Doggie Style is your go-to truck.	1
How could so many yelpers be so wrong?First of all, it's NOT an "Asian fusion" restaurant. Not even by a long shot. It's a more like a Chinese restaurant you'd find in the 80s in the Midwest that catered to Americans that called Italian food "ethnic food."The beef is loaded with baking soda to tenderize it. The pot stickers were like wrapped grease balls. We ordered 6 different things, and nothing was that good. It was difficult to flag a server down at a pretty slow time. To make matters worse, 4 of us were at a 6-seat table, when in the middle of the meal, they seated two complete strangers at our table.	0
Eat here it's great.	1
This place was really good! The crab fried rice is by far is my favorite! This is somewhere you should go with a group of friends b/c most of the food is tapas/small plates.	1
I have eaten at the fountain 3 times now, and I have not been disappointed. The Reuben, which I ordered two of the 3 times, is now my second favorite Reuben in town. The Cecil, a venison summer sausage sandwich, is also excellent. My friend called the Forward Burger one of the best burger's he's ever had, which is high praise from a guy who's tried most of the burger's in town. Their cheese curds are fantastic as well, definitely in my top five.	0
This place is totally over-rated. The only reason it received 2 stars from me is because of the fine waiter that we had. i ordered the spicy seafood jumbalaya. It was not what i expected. I could of gotten more for what i paid for. The was barely any seafood, and there was no taste, and the corn bread..OMG..my neice could of made that on her own. what your paying for is the soulful feeling that you have in the restaurant. but thats basically it. i dont reccommend spending no more that $40 at this joint.	0
My man and I came here on a date. Though our main waiter was charming, we won't be returning. Here's why:The host/bartender mispronounced a few of the items on the menu that are classic Italian staples, to the point that it was kinda comical. The polenta fries tasted only of the grease they were soaked in. No seasoning, and soupy on the inside. You need to towel things off, or at least let them drip dry, after frying them. They were alright as leftovers, once they were toweled off and given some salt and spices.The grilled calamari was drenched in a balsamic vinegar sauce that did nothing for the meat (which was really, really rubbery). Our drinks only came halfway through our meal.Way overpriced for the quality of its food. If your menu is stuck in the 80s, at least make it taste like it isn't reheated leftovers (also from the 80s).Pros:Their espresso martini was to die for.Their wine was delicious.My man enjoyed the meatballs. He usually does ;)I wanted to like you, I really did, but if I wanted sh*tty Italian food I'd sooner hit up Olive Garden.I know you guys are a new restaurant, and still working out the kinks. Good luck.	0
This was the best experience and quality I would have never expected to come out of a good truck. I tried the Picanha and lamb chops. Both were amazing but the lamb chops were so good they were addicting. I&#39;m coming to eat lunch here tomorrow. This is the best thing to happen to FIU since they added the new PG6 parking garage. A must late night munchies eat.	1
Visited on 12/27/2014 for lunch. <br>Regular chicken biryani is very worst. Full watery chicken pieces, no spices at all. I would say their rice items are bad. <br><br>4 piece Tandoori chicken was pretty good.	0
Venturing out to a spot that you have heard so many positive things about can be daunting in Los Angeles. <br><br>Thats all I can say.<br><br>I will finish this review when I can figure out exactly why this place bugged me.	0
Best deli in town!!...and i can walk to it!!....and i do...every week. <br><br>I usually get a Reuben, pancakes or omelets and have had the brisket sliders... all excellent. I also get a lot of food to go... and the guys that work the deli counter are the best. I highly recommend!!	1
We recently dined here for dinner on New Year's Eve with a group of 9 people. We were promptly seated and greeted by our waitress who was pleasant and helpful with drink and food suggestions. She was also more than willing to divide the bill into separate checks which was helpful for a large group! We enjoyed crab cakes, diablo shrimp, pork sliders and risotto cakes for appetizers and each were delicious. We also enjoyed the atmosphere and ambiance of the restaurant as it felt upscale but not pretentious. Our waitress came and told us that there was a small miscommunication in the kitchen and that our food would take a little longer. She brought additional appetizers out while we waited which demonstrated Fresco's attention to customer service and satisfaction. Our meals arrived shortly after. The Chicken Fresco and Short Rib entrees were plated beautifully and were very tasty. Overall, our dining experience was very good and we would be happy to return!	0
Diamond in the rough! This place is surprisingly great if you&#39;re looking for either a light lunch or a cool coffee spot.<br><br>Lunch: Their combo comes with 2 seasoned rice balls, a bowl of miso, and pickled veggies - it won&#39;t feed the beast, but it&#39;ll humble the grumble.<br><br>Coffee: They serve La Colombe!! Also plenty of tables, a &#34;bar&#34; table for solo workers, free wifi, and plenty of arm-leg room so it doesn&#39;t feel like a packed subway car.	1
I really wish I could rate this place higher, but I was disappointed on so many levels.I went here this past Saturday night. After the initial waitress sat me down, she totally forgot about me. Another waiter took my order following which, I never saw him again. I wanted to get the Urban Ramen, which I saw on their menu online. Apparently they don't have that anymore. If that's the case, why advertise it? So I ended up ordering the Tonkotsu Ramen for $12 (it's a dollar less on the online menu). It was pretty tasty, there was nothing special about the egg, but the ramen was enjoyable. Although I hit the point where I was almost full when I finished it, I wanted to hit that stuffed and satisfied spot like when I go to Daikokuya in Little Tokyo.That aside, I waited 25 MINUTES for my initial waitress to bring me my check. I literally was on my phone waiting. The restaurant was maybe 55-60% full and there was no-one waiting outside for a seat so no excuse for that. As I was waiting, I saw someone next to me with a clearly larger bowl than mine. She told me she got the Spicy Miso Ramen. The thicker noodles and $14 price ($2 more than my ramen) justifies the bigger serving I guess...To sum up, I was not happy with what I got for the price. I wish I just went to Daikokuya like I wanted. Would of gotten more and better quality for $9.50 plus FREE miso soup and salad. At Urban Ramen that's extra. If you do come here, come during lunch where you can get any ramen, a side rice bowl, and salad for $13.95, which is actually way worth the price in my opinion.	0
If you order a hamburger they only cook the meat medium well or well done. That makes me questionthe wuality of the meat you use. Had a croque monsieur which was below average, side of fries were excellent & so was the smoked salmon sandwich. The food is brought whenever anything you order is ready which means not necessarily in the order you want to eat it. The water glasses are so small you wonder who the is the genius who came up with that. Not a fan of their service... Aorry but will pass	0
HANDS DOWN my FAVORITE pastelito place ev-ar! for me this place is a staple, a constant of Miami Cuban culture. I&#39;ve been coming to this place for years, decades even! it&#39;s so good that when I go visit family and friends out of town, they ask me to bring them a box or two of these delicious treats. the staff hasn&#39;t changed - except maybe some new additions to help with the masses that are here every morning - same pastry chefs, same ladies behind the counter, same everything - why mess with a good thing? <br><br>their pastelitos de carne are the freaking best I&#39;ve ever had. all the others (guayaba, cheese, guayaba and cheese, papa rellena, etc.) come a close second but are still mouthwateringly delicious. their croquettas, either the ham or the chicken are outstanding. they have all sorts of dessert type sweet treats too, and even make cakes, but I always stick to the pastries cause they&#39;ve never done me wrong. another top favorite of mine, their fresh baked Cuban bread is unbeatable. <br><br>the prices are super cheap, I mean super. depending on when you go you may have quite a wait but - trust me - take a number, step back and let your hunger build until they call you....you will not be disappointed!	1
Hmm.. the more I come here, the more I dislike it and think to myself, &#34;WHY did I choose to dine here?&#34; <br><br>I came here today for a late lunch with my mom and Grace P. We were having a mother&#39;s/daughters&#39; day and although I wanted to go to Joan&#39;s on Third, we wanted a place where we could sit down and have waiter service. Toast is usually never packed on the weekdays so we stopped in for a quick bite. <br><br>We ordered:<br><br>- Cappucino<br>- Latte<br>- Chopped Salad<br>- Vegetable Soup<br>- Ahi Tuna Salad<br>- Split Pea Soup<br>- The Open Face <br><br>Total with tip, about $60. Worth it? Not really.<br><br>The coffees were delish. The cappucino had the right amount of foam. Unfortunately, everything else was mediocre to lacking. My Ahi Tuna Salad literally had 4 tiny pieces of tuna. It was kind of sad. My Split Pea Soup also looked like baby food. I felt like I was just eating pureed peas and veggies. <br><br>Also, when we were eating, the employees decided to sweep around us. I don&#39;t know about you, but that&#39;s kind of gross. If you&#39;re sweeping, dust is obviously going to get in our food.. and guess what? The food is going to be eaten. Soooo.. we sat there eating dust covered food. I wasn&#39;t going to say anything, but it got to a point where even my mother was annoyed (and she&#39;s a very patient person that rarely complains at restaurants, stores, etc.) SHE called someone over to tell them to sweep after we were done eating. <br><br>Honestly, I probably won&#39;t ever come back unless it&#39;s for coffee or to try some of their desserts. There are so many better places in LA! <br><br>FYI - DON&#39;T park on the streets. Grace P. decided not to read the sign that said &#34;NO PARKING ANYTIME&#34; so I got a ticket. Boo.	0
Been here a couple of times and this bar and restaurant does almost nothing wrong that I've seen. The cocktails that I have been served have been excellent, the food is good and priced for what it is, the space is commodious. The place is also linked to LA history and does not over-sell that legacy but does find a way to honor it. Sometimes there is slinky and non-invasive music spun by an inauspicious dj.The service is adequate, even professional, something that often is lacking in Silver Lake. There was a guy next to us with a selfie stick; the staff was far more courteous to him than I would have been, which speaks either to its strength or my own weakness.I think the wine list could be a little stronger top to bottom, especially on the bottom, but the pours are generous, which is what folks at the bar are looking for. This is the kind of place that is more driven by cocktail culture than dining culture, but the dining side doesn't let it down, instead rises to the challenge. Very much of its neighborhood; while there are plenty of other local entries that aspire to be neighborhood bars, this one is the most purely Silver Lake of that recent bunch. If you like the old adage, "Drink in a restaurant, eat in a bar," this one stands up very well on both ends.	1
Such a gem!	1
Great place for dining and wonderful service!! It was hard to find on google map being that it is inside of the cosmopolitan and on the third floor. Aside from that the place is a good find!	1
I come here almost everyday. I ordered fries today. It's was 2 minutes after they "stopped serving fries". And they refused to make an exception and do something that is very easy for a loyal customer. I will not come back. Do not recommend this place. Food is ok, people really need to open their eyes here and realize what customer service should look like. Thumbs down to them. This is not the only experience like this I've had there. Just the cherry on top to make me realize I no longer want to support them. I don't yelp. But u couldn't help myself on this one!	0
Rounded up but would say 3 1/2 stars.<br><br>I discovered and fell in love with samgyetang a few summers ago when studying abroad in Korea. (It was perfect for all those hangovers heheh hye-Jang!) so maybe I&#39;m spoiled from all the amazing samgyetangs I ate in Korea but I thought this place was good but not as amazing as all the yelp reviews led me to believe.<br><br>Ordered the basic samgyetang. I will say the chicken was cooked perfectly, it was very tender and fell right off the bone. They give you the basic banchans and of course the spicy banchans complement the chicken soup very well but I was severely disappointed by their kimchi that was way too fermented :/ overall the soup just didn&#39;t have that amazing healing taste and quality I&#39;ve come to expect from this dish.<br><br>Will probably come back since I have yet to find another samgyetang specialty restaurant in the area that does it better.<br><br>**service is amazing!! I know a lot of Korean restaurants have bad reps for being rude or having poor service but everyone here is so attentive and sweet and all smiles!	1
Good food, but bad service. Hostess was till haughty for my taste. I&#39;m all for fine dining, but they were a bit rude and we had to pretty much fight for our table by the ledge. Not a pleasurable experience. Pity too because the food and setup is all very tasteful. Need to work on hospitality.	0
Woke up this morning calling every five star restraint only to hear that they did not cater to dairy allergies...then my babe found this place, Freakish amazing omg!!!!!! This food is organic fresh and made to order	1
I can really only rate the corned beef sandwich, since I&#39;ve been there five or six times, and that&#39;s the only thing I order - it&#39;s just so damned good. Perhaps next time, I&#39;ll try something else... But probably not.	1
They do steak frites and they do it well. Meat was well cooked and tasty, as is the sauce it comes with. The fries are crunchy, well seasoned and delicious, and it all goes together - the meat, the sauce and the frites - on one fork very well. The $25 a dish felt reasonable and they have a solid wine selection too. Didn&#39;t try desert though. <br><br>Servers were lovely but the only thing keeping this from 5 stars is that they didn&#39;t come around with extra sauce on our second dish of steak frites. We saw them offer another table more sauce but I think they forgot us. Not huge, we still had sauce leftover, but would&#39;ve been nice to be offered. <br><br>Overall really liked this place. I went with my girl who lived i Paris for six years and she said it&#39;s pretty spot on to how it&#39;s done there. <br><br>Oh and do the soup over the salad, it&#39;s delicious.	1
We decided to eat here because we had just been to le reve. Every bite of food was perfectly made. Tater tots were to die for. I know, tater tots seem like an odd thing to comment on but just try them. Our server was Mora and she was charming. She made great recommendations and added some surprises to our menu.   For food of this high quality I felt our bill was quite reasonable.	1
Love the fried chicken here. <br><br>This location opened at the beginning of the year and is open til 9pm Sunday-Thursday.<br><br>Their signage isn&#39;t all that great, but its in the parking lot of the Holiday House hotel across from the Stratosphere.	1
Awesome sandwiches and amazing staff! Even if it&#39;s a little bit of a drive, I suggest stopping by!	1
I actually liked this place..<br><br>Didn&#39;t come here for brunch, just a random Tuesday morning so no trouble finding parking and no wait for a table neither. I had the caprese salad and french toast while my friend opted for a chicken wrap, tortilla soup and the fruit bowl. The taste I would rate at a 3 out of 5. I guess I went the safe yet boring route. I had been meaning to order the portobello sandwich.. but... the thought of stuffing my face at 10 am with something greasy... didn&#39;t sit too well in my mind. So safe route it is...<br><br>Definitely for next time....<br><br>BUT ~~ their cupcakes are pretty damn awesome btw!!!! I had the red velvet, blue velvet and chocolate. Did I mention I have a major sweet tooF? At $2.25 each I think they&#39;re a bargain compared to other places i&#39;ve been to.. Not to mention tastes a whole lot better too.	1
Nice place with interesting dishes. The wine selection is good and even though the place gets packed they are accommodating. We've been there a few times and enjoyed it.	1
Old school. I love it. Their sourdough toast (make sure you ask for it toasted), is realllly good. The food is decent diner food -- nothing to scream about -- but the portions are heart attack massive. Definitely getting bang for your buck here, and they&#39;re open 24/7! Literally. My kinda place. :P	1
Just ordered their cheesesteak hoagie w/ a side of fries..(walk-up / to - go)-25 minute wait (they told me 10 minutes)-The breadroll was stale.. I've never had an Amoroso roll this stale.. Maybe it wasn't even an Amoroso?(it says so on the menu)-The sandwich ingredients didn't blend well. It was very dry. A bit unusual for a cheesesteak. -Tomatoes and onions were placed on the outside of the roll. But maybe this is the way they typically serve the hoagie? But wrapped in foil, the tomatoes and onions were smashed up all over the outside of the roll. I found this to be a little odd.-Fries were ok.Considering the quality, price, and wait time, I found Whiz to be a bit underwhelming. As far as cheesesteaks in Los Angeles go, there are better options out there.	0
This place was like magic to me as a kid. I used to beg my parents to go here, but now that I'm an adult, I can see why they were reluctant. The food isn't great, and the service is pretty average. That, and the combination of animatronics, knick-knacks, and screaming children is enough to make anyone want to make sure they have some aspirin with their meal.	0
Love this place! atmosphere is amazing! food is awe soo good! looking forward to coming back for drinks and dinner at night as I only went for the day time brunch. The brunch special was lacking a bit.. the cornbread was pretty dry and not very sweet as Im accustomed too.. I mean if you are making corn bread it better be amazing! But the deviled eggs were outstanding! I feel more devilish now. Buger was probably the best I have had in NYC period.. Why 4 stars? cuz I wanna go back and try the dinner/drinks at night! I feel if i give em 5 stars Id have premeditated closure, nope not me.. no way.. I m going back for more!	1
I am SHOCKED that there are so many good reviews on here for this place. Few things-- As a pretty go with the flow kind of person, I was incredibly disappointed by the 1 hour and 22 minute wait for our order-- (totalling a small order of Cajun fries, 6 chicken fingers and a VERY basic finger sandwich-- for 38$ YIKES) -- holy disappointment. Don&#39;t stay open late if you can&#39;t handle the business. The poor guy in the kitchen was dripping sweat and the guy the front was munching on his very own french fries-- while we were sitting there waiting for our order. I just loved how the guy taking our order (won&#39;t mention his name) very casually said &#34;my bad-- I placed other orders before yours-- yours didn&#39;t go through, it&#39;s gonna be a while&#34; THANKS FOR NOTHING! <br><br>Ridiculous-- will never go back. <br><br>I will say their Bada Bing Chicken fingers were pretty tasty though-- Thank you to the one guy in the back who was working! <br><br>Cheers all-- Happy dining!	0
When my father in law surprised us with a visit, we were strapped for a lunch spot, especially given that him branching out means Northern Italian. I had heard great things about Cafecito, so we decided to put the square peg in a round hole and take him to Cafecito.<br><br>To all of our surprise, he loved his Cuban Sandwich. I loved mine too. This place is clean, fast, and very good. No one is going to call you papi or mi nino, but it does a good Loop lunch.	1
I must eat some crow as my prior critique was wrong.	0
Good burger.....not great like I have heard so many people say. The atmosphere itself was pretty laid back, simple decor. The staff were nice overall, it's just a stop in burger spot to grab a quick bite.	1
My boyfriend and I went for some late night munchies. Service was average for that time of night- not going to complain. He ordered the Retro burger and I ordered the Veggie burger. We both enjoyed the meals until 2 am rolled around. I was sick for about three days. We are long distance so that ruined the weekend. With that being said I&#39;ll never go back.	0
Taste is kinda "ok". Since this ramen burger got all the LA restaurant-goers' attention, I also went there and tried the original one without any substances. Without further due, it's a disappointment knowing the price of this food. Basically the burger sauce and ramen bun/patty don't go well which even gives a little bitter taste. Then I realized this four star reviews are merely based on such hyper people made themselves with Japanese restaurant fantasy lolYou can try it for its uniqueness but with this price you wouldn't want to try it ever again.	0
Great Restaurant, Make you want to go there aagin. A 10/10 rating restaurant.	1
This place is like a secret diamond diner...I love coming here and probably come at least 3x times a month. You feel like your at a homey joint the crowd is all different. Each visit its like coming home to eat a home cooked meal. The staff is great and the coffee and bosanova os off the hook.	1
We had the escargot, bone marrow and the veal at this French restaurant. If you want the french experience stick to the following two things: "do you speak French?" scene from groundhog day and French fries.	0
Love this place! The burgers, the onion rings, the tattor tots. Topped with a Mexican coke!!! It's all just yummy.	1
wanted so much more.reservations for 8 at 5:30 on a friday night, made a month in advance. went to opera with my parents, boyfriend and some best friends, hence the early reservation. we weren't a 'surprise' party. we had a blast with each other. but, the poor service overshadowed the restaurant completely.i actually felt badly for the waitress. she was too busy to be effective. she was nice and tried to hard to do good. but, she just wasn't there for us. and the busboys, who had to pick up the slack.i really feel like her management screwed her. she was working in too many places at once and was screwed by the bartender who was a major bottleneck. it was raining all day. everyone in SF knows that makes for a HUGELY busy friday night happy hour. perhaps a little extra staff on a rainy friday when Tosca is across the street AND you have an 8 top at 5:30... we ended up going to the bar to buy drinks on one occasion. (O3, that's embarrassing for you.)someone please tell me why the busboys cleared our plates and silverware when they dropped off the steak tartar? made no sense. and, of course, the staff disappeared. so, we passed around the plate and ate while hovering over the serving plate. WHICH, by the way had 5 toast soldiers, at a table for 8. go ahead, surprise me, ask if we want enough toast so everyone at the table can have one. she also let us buy 5 pot stickers and 4 ribs. don't worry about it, i don't need your help ensuring we order enough food for the table.the food? it was actually really good. Scallops were nice and simple. walu was fresh and flavorful. pork chop was best food on table. it was obviously brined. it was nice and salty and crisped. chicken adobo was ok chicken with ok sauce. meh.i'll say this. the location is amazing. too bad the experience wasn't.	0
Just great. Plain and simple. From the great services this mom and pop (quite literally) place to their daughter server, thus is one of the new gems of the new East Harlem. The calamari was fresh and had an unexpected, but welcome twist with seasoned fried lemon slices. Delicious. I had the Gambas (Camarones) de la Diabla. Spectacular. A friend, visiting from Ohio had the steak tacos. Very good and another friend had the Matas Cuarto (1/2 chicken with rice abound beans) delicious. Their ubique Margarita Is The perfecto blend of grapefruit juice, tequila and a tasty red pepper sugar rim. Tasty moderation is the name, great tastes is the game.	1
Even with a small menu, you can find several choices of entrees that will tempt you.  I had the bacon wrapped beef and lamb meatloaf.  It was very tasty and moist.  There was a good selection of vegetables served with this dish along with some unique mashed potatoes.  My husband had the spicy shrimp and chirorzo over pasta.  Again, this entree was very good.  I would definitely go back to this restaurant and recommend it to anyone looking for a restaurant in Annapolis.	0
SATURDAY MUSIC!!! great ambiance for a date or family gathering. Try most of their appetizers!! Very authentic atmosphere!! :))	1
So my sister prefaced our visit with a, so when we get inside, it's going to look really weird and dumpy, but the food is really good. I'd say it was a super accurate description. The interior tries to be nice and bright with some yellow paint on the walls. They got into the holiday spirit with a tree and pictures wrapped like presents on the wall but it still just didn't feel like it was tied together.	0
I have been going to the apple pan since i was a baby in diapers. This is Vintage LA at it's best. The hickory burger is by far the best burger ever! This place is heaven on a stick. Don't forget a baked Dailey homemade pie for desert!	1
This seems like a pretty common sentiment: diner is cute, but the food is just okay, and not worth the prices they charge. Fries are from a frozen bag. I did not enjoy the banana cream pie (too mushy - but maybe I'm just not a banana cream pie person) or the apple pie (watery).Upside: When we went, Orlando Bloom walked in an plopped down next to us. So theres that.	0
This place is awesome. Formica tables; a wild assortment of clientele from local fams to downtown hipsters to cops taking a break (and, luckily, the hipsters are the rarest breed); the most basic of basic food (would you like bacon with your bacon?). The entire place smells of grease. I love it. They&#39;re REALLY nice here, too.<br>NB: I only come here in off hours for breakfast so am blissfully unaware of any really crowded times, late-night &#34;scenes&#39;, or any meal but breakfast.	1
If you're looking for a bar with good specials and that solid old neighborhood bar feel, Plaza's your place. Cheap drinks every night of the week, plenty of TVs, pool, lots of seating. This place has everything a classic bar should have, and it doesn't pretend to be anything else - which is why I love it. Higher end bars aren't always a bad thing, but whenever you want to ditch the fancy drinks and get some good bar food instead, Plaza's here for you.	0
WHERE Are the ORIGINAL OWNERS???? They used to run an honest and enjoyable restaurant! Now the new owners are so unpolite, dont care about the customners, dont even smile at all...!!<br><br>Well thank god Maria&#39;s grrek is just around the corner. This was my last visit with a date What an embarrasement! <br><br>I missed the old owners my family and I used to be treated so friendly before now its just ..pay and dont complain cause we will treat you like ...:not good...&#34;<br><br>Maria&#39;s does not have the cook Mikonos has, but they treat you right. Well can;t have everything can you?	0
I just had such a nice brunch here. It&#39;s like walking into old world Europe . It&#39;s a quiet, relaxed, gourmet by your boot straps kind of place. A lot of Bushwick is overwrought with it desire to be over sophisticated against the stark contest of the industrial landscape. But this place is crusty bread, simple service, chalk menus and quiet reality. Good job guys.	1
I have made so many visits to Nordstrom and I had never stopped in here. I was at the mall with some girl friends and when we got hungry, Karina G. suggested we go here. Great idea! It is a nice sit down casual spot. Nice way to take a shopping break and get some energy to keep on going but not waste too much time. You order at the front and they take the food to your table. I cannot remember the name of my paninni but I know I LOVED it. I remember it had turkey, yummy cheese, and something sweet...it&#39;s escaping me now but it was delicious.	1
Boy howdy is this place romantic! Flowing canvas top partially covering the night sky, dimly lit, and BAM, a giant tree in the middle. Ironically enough, I did not come here with the bf but, rather, one of my girls for her birthday.<br><br>As someone who wasn&#39;t much of a drinker, I ordered the La Morandina Moscato. It was a very sweet, sparkling white wine -- just like I like&#39;em! For appetizer, we had the mussels and scallops. The mussels were served in a thin, creamy sauce with large chunks of bacon. The sauce was very subtle which is all that&#39;s needed when you&#39;re eating very fresh seafood cooked to perfection! The seared scallops were a tad salty but tasted better once eaten with the creamy sauce. Also, with only two scallops in the dish, $16 seemed pretty pricey to me.<br><br>For the main course, my friend and I shared the Pork Belly &amp; Skate Wing. The pork belly was exceptional. Crispy skin, melty fat, and beyond tender pork meat. As an avid pork eater, I can truly say this is the best pork belly I&#39;ve ever had! The skate wing was a red-meat fish that was surprisingly mild. The fish meat was so tender that it fell off my fork as I was picking it up! It also had a crunchy salty crust to it. Very delicious.<br><br>For dessert, we had the Pistacho Creme Brulee and Hazelnut Gelato. The gelato was standard and the creme brulee was very good. Everything you&#39;d expect a pistachio creme brulee to be.<br><br>To top it off, we were served by a server that looked like Milo Ventimiglia! It took everything out of me to not say &#34;I loved you in Gilmore Girls!&#34;	1
The meat was good & plentiful and the salad bar was phenomenal. If the meal had stopped right there I would have been thrilled... BUT ... they are sneaky about what other things cost. I thought the dessert and final tiny drink were included in the buffet price because nothing was said about 'now you are going beyond the $40 buffet price'. And the drinks are poured very stingy (especially considering how expensive they are) ... the final bill was a shock needless to say.	0
Love the Counter, love this location. I've tried several Counters in the area and much prefer this location to the West Hollywood one. I have Celiac disease so the Counter is a go-to spot for me when eating out-- gluten free buns, separate fryer for french fries / sweet potato fries (!! this is huge y'all, not many places have this), milkshakes (peanut butter chocolate, hello), and they are super accommodating with my dietary needs. I can bring friends/family here for a casual meal and there is something for everyone--GF, DF, vegetarian, vegan. I have never gotten glutened or sick from this location which is a big deal for someone dining out with a food- and cross contamination-related medical condition. I can eat safely here and that is paramount for any dining out experience for me. So for all of the reasons above, we are very loyal diners. And they recognize this and we are always welcomed warmly. Mike at the bar is wonderful and we've pretty much always gotten really great service. Obviously beer is a big thing here (and they have a good draft list and I have beer envy!) but there is a fine, inexpensive selection of wine, well-suited for a burger joint. Parking is easy with a validated lot in the back so we never have to worry about that, either.	1
Delicious!!!! I might become a regular here. I got the drunken noodle with chicken and a side salad... What can I say, I went safe lol. It was delicious, the flavor was perfect. It was pretty spicy, so I'm glad I went with the suggestion of getting it medium. I was a skeptic because I drove passed it, and didn't expect it to be so pretty inside. But, it was really nice. They were pretty empty, but it turned out they just opened a few months ago. Parking was pretty good because it's in a strip mall. Which is a good thing, because parking in Los Angeles is absolutely terrible.	1
This was the first place I was taken when I visited LA for the first time, and it's still a fave. Because of this, every time I come back to LA after being away for a while, this is the first place I want to go. I think I've inadvertently gotten the Alice's Egg Sandwich every single time, even with their HUGE menu, but probably won't quit anytime soon. This is the quintessential diner experience and LA vibe all rolled into one, but how many diners do you know that serve beer, or have booths carved into the window?! It's small and is usually crowded, but take advantage of that 24/7 availability sometime.	1
Great service, okay food. My proscuitto &amp; mozzarella sandwich was alright (I mean how can you really go wrong with those 2 ingredients), nothing to write home about. Quick service and friendly staff.	0
Clean, fast, and decent variety...simply put.<br><br>I had been hearing about this place for a while and finally went to check it out. <br>The good: the Thai salad-oh so good!, plenty of dressings and toppings, the soft serve ice cream is sinful and they have sugar free options in the desserts. It&#39;s super clean, and the staff is friendly.<br><br>The bad: it does lack a little on the proteins, and the other items available can derail your diet.<br><br>Overall, not bad at all. $12 unlimited. I&#39;ll take it.	1
Avalon roll is delicious	1
Met some friends for brunch on Sunday. It was busy but it didn't seem like the wait was too long for non-reservers. The food was delicious as were the mimosas and bellinis we ordered! Will definitely go back again!	1
Had a generous gift certificate with a bottle of wine to try. It was okay. Really loud and the service was quite slow. Empanada was fair the pablano sauce was good. I had the tenderloin (Loma I think) and it was good but not great.	1
I got a pot full of tofu with three mussels and three shrimps for $35. While the music was great, the food clearly gives a bad image of Korean food. I wouldn&#39;t recommend this place.	0
I wish I didn&#39;t need to write this review so then people wouldn&#39;t know about it. But yea, eventually this place is going to get really popular. That&#39;s because it&#39;s pure awesome. Open air restaurant and high-end bar, 8 stories up. I had some pork buns and they were damn tasty. I also had some belgian beer I had never heard of, on tap, and it was very tasty. I don&#39;t care if it was $11 for a pint. This is probably the best date spot I&#39;ve ever been to. I hope it doesn&#39;t get overrun with people as to make it difficult to be romantic. I think if it continues to close at 11:00, then it might stay that way. If they keep it open until 2, then it might turn into a party house. Except there is a pool and no loud music, so maybe it will keep low key. Great service too!<br><br>Edit:<br><br>Came back here like 6 months later and the place had changed. They no longer had the seating area down by the fire pit for people to just hang out - they converted it into an awkward table for like 8 people. And the menu had totally changed. Still a great spot, just not as good as when they opened.	1
The Cut LV and LA are always winners. The melt in your mouth steaks are filled with flavor and cooked to perfection.  The Wagyu filet is buttery and supremely tender. The flavorful Wagyu rib eye is rich, marbled, heaven. Cornfield ribeye and filets are solid as well. I love the asparagus and mashed potatoes. Mac n cheese is good but heavy and a bit overpowering of you want to truly savor the flavors of the steaks. Yuzu wasabi and horseradish sauces are my favorites. Wine list has plenty of goodies and I love the iPad feature with wine info and ability to send yourself a photo of your wine label with the press of a button. Banana cream desert trumped baked Alaska by a mile. The cut never disappoints. The chairs here are fabulous but I always prefer the booths.	1
Ambiance- upscale casual; homey, warm (fireplace).<br><br>The restaurant had less seating than I expected, so anticipate a decent wait if you don&#39;t have a reservation.<br><br>That said, we were given complimentary cornbread for having to wait. Cornbread was fantastic; served with maple butter.<br><br>Ordered ribs with fries. The ribs were spot-on. Meat comes off the bone with minimal effort on your part. Delicious BBQ sauce, and they bring you a couple others to add as you wish. Fries were thin and plentiful.<br><br>Tried the Oriechiette, which was surprisingly good for a pasta dish at a restaurant known for comfort food.<br><br>Skillet cookie dessert. Highly recommend it.<br><br>Bottom line: Definitely worth your time to try.	1
Good prices for the hookah. Allows 18+. Laid back spot, almost like you&#39;re at a friend&#39;s place. Solid.	1
Another taco bell	0
I love the new location in Tribeca. The staff are knowledgeable and friendly; they make great suggestions and allow you to taste the wine before choosing. They had a varied selection at different price points and the happy hour prices are especially good. As for the food, I&#39;ve only tried the Roast Pork sandwich with rapini which was delicious.	1
Great Italian Restaurant, great service, great food, the Owners are very humble people	1
The staff is SOO friendly and the doughnuts are amazing! I joined them on Facebook and they send out the daily doughnuts and any specials that there might be. Very creative!	1
We went here.. and got so much food on the house!?! the tandori chicken was delicious and the mango smoothies are amazing.	1
I paid $5.58 for a shake--too much. It tasted good, but next time I'll drive another two minutes to Culvers and save $1.50. Culvers tastes good too and is also a Wisconsin company.	0
Convenient, fresh ingredients, friendly staff, 24/7.	1
If I could give Playa Provisions half of a star, I most definitely would. I found my experience there to be very poor. I found the managers and the pastry chef to be extremely rude . I didn&#39;t care too much for the food. Every time I would go to the restaurant, my food was freezing cold and the desserts I thought were poorly constructed. I wish that they would keep the same kind of desserts that they had when I first went there. The only few things that I liked and appreciated were the bartenders in the whiskey bar and the bussers, Marvin, Justin, Ezequiel, and there were a few servers that I&#39;ve had that I found to be very nice and sweet, Luis, Dominic, Misty, Dede, Brian, and Jessica. I mostly appreciated Luis. Just because this place is on the beach does not mean that they need to charge way more than necessary. I also can&#39;t forget to mention that every time I found a BUG not only in my food but also in the bathrooms as well. Definitely won&#39;t be coming back here ever again. Don&#39;t know how they manage to have an a with bugs the size of roaches in that facility.	0
I would give Umami Burger 3 stars, but I don't think this place is "A-Ok" although it has atmosphere and has a creative approach to perhaps the least creative American meal. I ordered an Umami Burger and was expecting lettuce, onion, and the usual standard burger; instead I got a thick but fatty (too fatty) burger, marinated shitake mushroom, sliver of tomato, crusty disk of parmesean cheese, and caramelized onions. Quite frankly it was really good for a couple of bites but then it got me confused and greasy-full feeling. Between the marinated mushroom, toasted bun, caramelized (very sweet) onions, and everything else, my palate was very, very confused: too much going on at one time. Also, I agree with reviewers who say it leaves you feeling kind of gross and sluggish. I also had some fries (thick cut) and onion rings, and half-way through the meal I looked at my dining partner and said let's take this to go unless you have another 20 minutes to try to digest all of this. It was just too rich for my taste! Also the bill was ridiculously high at $40 with tip. I would take In-N-Out (despite it's weird religious affiliation) over this on most any day. . .sorry Umami Burger :(	0
Was very annoyed of having to drive all the way downtown from Sherman Oaks for business lunch at Perch, but it ended up being the highlight of my day! The location, the view, the vibe, the service, the FOOD...next time you need a break and an experience, do yourself a favor, make the pilgrimage - you won&#39;t be disappointed. Treat yourself to something special. <br>P.S. See if you can get Colin to be your server, the man is a real pro, and just a joy to deal with.	1
Best BBQ in Seattle (not that there's a ton of choices). The pulled pork sandwich is the best by far. Ribs are good and the sides fantastic (succatash jalape\u00f1o mashed potatoes cornbread). Great service and be sure to bring you're dog (outside) for a special treat.	1
i had their sweet potato fries, tri-berry pancakes (which has three different kinds of pancakes INSIDE the pancake), and penne mattina.tri-berry pancakes were yummy in the beginning but not so much as I was trying to finish it. penne mattina was NOT good at all, perhaps because it was a "breakfast" menu.... there wasn't enough pesto sauce for the pasta so we had to use some from the pesto sauce they gave us with the bread.they are supposed to give you breads after you order but we had to ask them for it since they forgot to give us some. and when we did ask, they were giving us a look and said "oh, another one? ok..";;it wasn't that crowded but they workers there weren't paying much attention to us... maybe because we were young compared to other customers....	0
A must have Asada Fries yummy! Also don't forget the Chipotle Fish Tacos! This Mexican Place Rocks!	1
I&#39;ve been here at least 3x and everytime the food is just good. Nothing special but last night I had two chicken tacos and one steak tacos and am now bed ridden because I got FOOD POISONING! Don&#39;t know what went wrong but the thought of bacteria in their meats is horrendous. Ugh!	0
Food was mediocre, but filling as we had the 3 course tasting menu. Overall it tasted okay, but felt like every course had tomato sauce. Overdone and not enough variety. Could have been a better meal if everything wasn't covered in cheeses and sauce.	1
My coworkers and I go here once every one to two weeks. I seriously believe I could eat here everyday. Even the pickiest of my coworkers can find something they enjoy here and the food is consistently good every time.	1
"Do you want me to light your drink on fire?""Huh?"For about two years I called this "the bar in the alley." Bit the bullet one night and decided to wander in with a couple friends and just about lost my mind. Incredible beers on tap and an even more incredible selection of hard-to-find Japanese beers (execpt, um, don't try the oyster-flavored one). The food is underrated too -- I suppose you have to know what to order but it's hard to go wrong with a sizable $7 plate of Short Ribs. But what sold me was the unexpectedly fun atmosphere. The bartenders are all very sociable and the people at the bar were nice, too. My new favorite bartender in LA, Sybil, decided to light my beer on fire. I'm not sure when I requested this, but she handed me a straw and told me to watch my eyebrows. HUH?And then it was announced that we had a birthday boy at the bar and the staff proceeded to kill the lights, SET THE BAR ON FIRE, and pour one flaming shot after another into a brandy glass for immediate consumption. I can't wait for my birthday ...	1
Was there during happy hour on a Friday between 3-6pm. The ambience is similar to a Cheesecake Factory or Venetian's Grand Lux Cafe. All the food and drinks were very tasty. Tuna roll, albacore nigiri, kogi beef tacos, edamame (spicy), and definitely going back for the baked mac and cheese entree. OMG, sooo yummy! Service was great.	1
Amazing taco place with great selection.	1
Great food at cheap prices! I didn't even know there was a place like this in kent. I had a delicious falafel sandwich and my boyfriend had a gyro he said it was very fresh! Delicious Olive Tree fries with cheese as well we will come back!	1
This is a really nice looking bar with really nice bartenders. What&#39;s also really nice is $1 oysters all night on Mondays! And they were delicious! This would probably be an even nicer deal if you made it in time for their happy hour. I have only had oysters and wine here, so not sure about any other food and drink offerings at this time. Anyway, I had a really nice time at OTB.	1
We came here for brunch on a Sunday, and were promptly seated by the window- the meal was off to a great start! But then came the fruit flies, buzzing all around and near us. Perhaps it was an off day for Distilled, but I was instantly put off of eating (which never happens!) even before ordering my food.<br><br>Food-wise, everything was okay but I was really too distracted by the fruit flies, which I think may have tainted my whole experience. We ordered the franklin burger with an egg and tater tots, the country fried duck and waffles, the distilled wings, and a jar of the meadmosa special. I remember really enjoying the bite of the duck and waffles, but not being that impressed by the distilled wings, which we didn&#39;t finish. The burger was like any other burger and I did not appreciate the tater tots, which sounds absurd coming from me because I LOVE my potatoes. I also didn&#39;t particularly enjoy the meadmosa but my friends did so perhaps those fruit flies really did a number on me that day.<br><br>I would like to return for dinner and order the duck and waffles, but only because I feel like my judgment was clouded. Or maybe Distilled and I were just not meant to be...	0
Soo... I&#39;m sitting here on a beautiful day in LA across the street from where I live. My friends recommend I check out this cool outdoor spot. I guess it was the opening of a new exhibit so there was a theme in patio today.<br><br>You can choose from the wine list and special theme drinks only. If you read my reviews by now you know I am diabetic and only drink Martinis. No biggie. What are my alternatives to the fancy sugar drinks? Sry. Only these... no deviations. .<br><br>Ok. Diet coke and check please...<br><br>Too rigid for my money..	0
Cute restaurant and lounge in DTLA. We came on a Sunday evening so we really didn&#39;t get the crowded hustle and bustle of a Friday and Saturday night. <br><br>The decor is phenomenal and the vibe was comfortable and loungey. Which was nice considering it is in the middle of downtown.<br><br>They have a limited menu but the food was good and they prices were reasonable for DTLA in my opinion. <br><br>Downfall, was they close the top rooftop early than the lower floor patio on Sunday. But the inside stays open later than the outside lower patio. Also, no food on the rooftop, so we had to eat downstairs. Confusing? I agree. <br><br>It&#39;s kind of annoying to keep changing places with drinks and belongings in hand. And it is strange to have diff closing times in different locations of the same place. <br><br>Overall, good service, food, decor, and views.	1
Went out last night to a play in Hollywood, and this restaurant was the PERFECT choice. The service was fantastic (really sweet, adorable waitress), and the food was delicious. Thank you Hollywood Corner for such a great start to a lovely evening.	1
Long wait and the food wasn&#39;t that great. Took me 45 minutes to get my food after my friends got their plates at our table. Unacceptable.	0
I&#39;d give this place 4.5 stars (c&#39;mon Yelp - half stars please!) as it closes during the week @ 8PM and weekends @ 9PM - way too early. <br>I&#39;ve only had the sandwiches and not the &#39;in-bone&#39; chix selections. For $9 one gets a deliciously moist chicken sandwich fried in a delectably crispy and tasty batter as well as 2 sides. I recommend the buttermilk biscuit as the sandwich bread - it will fall apart in your hands, but it&#39;s worth it. <br>For a side, the Mac &#39;n cheese is a good bet as well as a dessert of either peach cobbler or bread pudding - don&#39;t be too judgmental as the two sides only add $3 to the bill.<br>The service staff was incredibly patient, friendly and informative as I notified the two helpful young women that I was a first-time customer.	1
My friends and I have a hobby of selecting a high-profile restaurant every couple of month or so to indulge our senses. We have dined at some of the most prestigious restaurants in the country and we have all agreed that Chef Atila at Barton G's in Los Angeles is near the top of our list. We went because of the hype, and hoped the food wouldn't fall short of the ingenuity. Chef Atila's Wagu beef special, the lobster poptart and Mac 'n Cheese didn't disappoint. If anything, it equaled the presentation. The cocktails were also delicious. I highly suggest the experience. A special thank you to our waitress Alex who made our evening a memorable one. Chef Atila, please add the Wagu as a permanent fixture on the menu.	1
My husband and I brought our kids (ages 16 and 10) and we had a fabulous experience.  The waiter and all the staff were very attentive to our needs.  The waiter was very helpful with the drink menu in suggesting drinks the kids would love.  He also helped us with the menu and adjusted a menu item to suit our son's taste buds.  The food was impeccable and the dessert had our taste buds dancing !!  Thank you so much for such a great experience !!	1
After a couple of meals here, this restaurant became our favorite in town. Don't come here looking for spaghetti and meatballs. Papavero's ever changing menu is full of inventive, home-style Italian food. House-cured meats and house-made foie gras, amazing seafood dishes (including several preparations of octopus that are the best I've had) and a great accessible wine list. Focus on the specials, which are plentiful. The servers are knowledgeable and always do a great job recommending a wine to go with your meal. Like the rest of the menu, Papavero's desserts are inventive and amazing. The budino (butterscotch pudding) will change the way you think about pudding and butterscotch. Finally, bar manager, Kevin, has put together the finest restaurant bar in town. His house made spirits include fantastic limoncello and nocino, and his cocktails are out of this world. I could go on and on, but really, I just can't recommend this restaurant highly enough. With the leisurely pacing and cozy, casual atmosphere, you'll feel like you're enjoying a elaborate, home-cooked meal in Northern Italy.	1
The place is so and so...the price is too high for what you eat, ! I&#39;m not recommend it!!!	0
Free chocolate chip cookie with check-in!!<br>The cookie made my top 10 cookie list and the KFC was very good. Basically a Chicken Fried Chicken with gravy	1
This is a lovely restaurant, and the food is very good. The service, however, was a joke. Save for one waiter (dark hair and glasses, who was sweet and attentive), the remainder of the wait staff were either affectedly rude (could hardly be bothered to point out where the restroom was), inattentive, or outright unprofessional (belly hanging out over his jeans beneath a yellow t-shirt while he checked his fingernails rather than seeing if we were interested in another drink). We tipped accordingly.	0
The food is terrible, I gave them 2-stars only because they have good service. <br><br>We ordered a pasta and a ravioli, each cost about $20, but the quality is similar to what I get from a Italian fastfood chain. The sauce is too creamy and doesn&#39;t have much taste. The ham is definitely not Italian ham, it&#39;s like refrigerated cooked ham that I can get from a regular supermarket. This place is definitely overpriced. The dishes are also very Americanized. If you are looking for authentic Italian cuisine, don&#39;t go to this place.	0
Great north indian food.	1
pasta was over cooked and shrimp was undercooked. love the bread	1
Amazing food. Had the Chola sandwich. Slammin! Get extra spicy sauce. So good! Def coming back	1
All I have to say is this place is pretty cool. And you know what the food was pretty good to boot. I got a lot flack from my friends for going here but I don&#39;t care. It&#39;s good and I fully support this urban taco fabricator.	1
I hate this place - I am amazed by the fact they got any good reviews.<br><br>First, as other people have mentioned, they do not let you make reservations unless you order one of their extremely expensive tasting menus. So, if you don&#39;t want to pay A LOT of money for one of these, you&#39;ll be waiting for quite a long time and getting attitude from a pretentious host. This sort of reminds me of Samurai Mama&#39;s ridiculous policies. I can&#39;t stand places like this. <br><br>Maybe their arrogance would be better justified if the place didn&#39;t look like a dingy piece of crap and if the food was actually decent. My boyfriend had the duck and I had the cod. The duck was so tough and he was pretty pissed he paid so much for it. This is unusual because he is far from a picky eater. My cod was extremely bland and disappointing. I still can&#39;t believe the prices for food that is this mediocre. <br><br>As I briefly mentioned, the place is dingy. It&#39;s small and kind of looks like it doesn&#39;t get cleaned very often. It amazes me that they try to pass this off as upscale. Please, save yourself the time and money and go to one of the other nice restaurants in the neighborhood.	0
I found this place pretty meh. I went Saturday for lunch. It has a fun funky vibe and staff were friendly. I probably would have liked it when I was in college but that was a LONG time ago. Got Chinese chicken salad which was not remotely Chinese, Western greens neither looked nor tasted fresh and I'd guess were some packaged salad mix. Chicken without flavor. Only flavor was vague citrus/soy from dressing. Also, if you're going to toast bread it has to be served fresh & hot or it's a brick. This was a brick; they'd do better to serve bread untoasted. Tea was hot & came in a pot, a plus. For dessert I got ice cream sandwich. Cookies had only very faint chocolate taste. You can make ice cream sandwich with firm cookies & firm ice cream or soft cookies & soft ice cream; this was hard cookies & soft ice cream so every bite made ice cream squirt out. The non-alcholic sangria was best part of meal. Food cheap & plentiful, as I said, I would have liked it in college. But I won't be back.	0
I live on the same block as Cascalote and I have to say, I feel lucky! I waited a while before trying the place out because I was weary of another Mexican place opening up here in east Harlem and I normally order from El Paso but this place is amazing! After reading the reviews here, I know they are doing their thing and I have no fears at ordering absolutely anything they have. <br><br>When I called to order, the girl on the phone was so friendly and helpful and recommended a few of the best dishes. I went with steak nachos which were out of this world. She said that every chip has everything on it and she was not lying. &amp; My boyfriend LOVES their fish tacos! They taste very fresh.<br><br>We had the flan for dessert and it was awesome as well.<br><br>And she delivered it herself! We live next door to the place. haha<br><br>Overall wonderful experience. Cant wait for my next meal here!	1
Really like going here! A bit of city life feel in our small Silverdale town. Meet my friends after a long day at the office. Service is great and food never takes long to get.	1
My wife and I have frequented a multitude of Italian restaurants and the food here is quite memorably good! We will return. Service was prompt and friendly, but we did arrive (7:30 reservation) before several larger groups so our server had more time to tend to us too. We split a $12 salad -- and each received plenty and the &quot;half&quot; portions were presented nicely on 2 plates. Finally, we carried in a very nice bottle of wine. Corkage was a bit high at $35. Overall, we were very pleased!	1
Post Office is lovely.<br><br>OTB may be lovelier.<br><br>The Ruby Rum is pretty awesome.<br><br>Also, I&#39;m just a sucker for Aperol.<br><br>And the escargot is pretty much a cacophony of delicious melodies in your mouth.<br><br>This may be the new spot.<br><br>Don&#39;t know if I can handle two at once.	1
Gather is a Lincoln Square gem! From the low-set lighting, to the open floor plan, and the sleek decor all throughout, this place was impressively appetizing. <br><br>For a table of two, we started with the &#34;Gather and share&#34; menu: the mussels with white beans (good, but not outstanding), sweet potato soup (incredible!), and cauliflower (spicy, with a sesame seed twist). These were paired with a smooth Malbec.<br><br>We proceeded with the individual sized meals: pulled pork (excellent), spinach gnocchi (good, but my fantastic), scallops (amazing), and the seared chicken (very good). <br><br>Lastly, we selected the rum cake drizzled with dark chocolate and served over home-made vanilla ice-cream. This was paired with their French press coffee, which was average. <br><br>The menu was as great as the atmosphere! Our server was very cordial, and informative. We were always promptly provided with whatever we needed, by our server or the numerous wait-staff sauntering around wih an open eye. The entire dining experience was memorable. The quality/variety on the menu is in junction with the pricing- very fair.<br><br>Two people ate satisfyingly well that evening, and will certainly venture back!	1
I love this place. Almond French toast. Friendly waitstaff. Cool little joint.	1
We went in with high expectations based on the reviews of others and were disappointed at every turn. The wait was too long far beyond their estimate and the food was overdone and cool. We won't be back.	0
I was there the first time today, I have passed by it so many times but today I decided to dive in. With all the food options in the area I was not that impressed. The salads are a bit pricey for what you get. I am a person the quality of food not the quanity of it. This is a time when there was too much salad dressing or was it the liquid from the oranges? The lettuce was a bit limp but it was good, not great.	0
Sunday for lunch looking for a quick bite on honeymoon. Location was really cute rustic trendy baby! Fast service & semi friendly to boot. No citrus ale for me pale ale (Fremont university) ordered and sipped. I liked it. Insta-buzz. Tv has the football game on so new hubby is happy. Looked around small & quaint! Then I tried a sample of Creme Brfble9e beer on tap... Yum! Parmesan artichoke dip... Awesome! Service was better by the minute... Nice waiter. Then potato salad and Italian panini arrived... Hmmmm kinda small portions on potato salad but doable. Took one bite and it was pretty good. We split a full panini and app. So it worked! Wanted the French dip but they were out (at 130pm on a Sunday??). Italian was just okay will not order again. But place has potential for a 2nd visit next time we're around town...	1
Adequate, service was fast, price seemed reasonable, but 3 drinks appetizers for 2 price north of 140.00	0
I like their food, but the service is horrible. The servers are rude and unprofessional.	0
Food has gone down hill or maybe it&#39;s because the service is so bad at least such a bad taste in your mouth	0
Fantastic menu and delicious food. Friendly welcoming servers. Prompt service. Best of all, the food was delicious and creative. Best mango cake dessert ever!	1
The first time I came here, I would have given this place a five star rating, but my roommate and I had different impressions, so I let it go. The two of us are constantly having ramen dates, perpetually searching for the best ramen ever. As I said, the first time I came here, it was a serious contender for me. Because I'm a creature of habit with all things I find satisfaction in, I ordered the same thing both times--Spicy Mala with added pork belly. I took a picture of the first bowl and Instagrammed it, because that's the kind of person I am. I salivated over the photo regularly and shared it with everyone I came into contact with--the photo not the saliva. The presentation was perfect; the flavors remarkable. This second time felt like a half-assed attempt at half assery, though. The flavors were mostly good, although the chicken has a few bad pieces amongst them. The presentation was sloppy and not in a "we're really busy and we're doing the best we can with what we have" sorta way. The halved hard boiled egg looked like the remnants of an Easter I'd rather forget. The egg must have been pulled into two halves with someone's fingers, because there is just no other reasonable explanation for its state of existence. Everything else just left me longing for the presentation, taste, and excitement I get when I eat at Ken Ken. If only they had better hours. I probably won't return to Saiwaii. I can make better ramen at home. Luckily my roommate didn't go with me this time, so she can't say "I told you so."	0
I really wanted to like the Old Ship Saloon, the interior wood decor was really nice and the reviews were good. Maybe I went on an off night, but the quesadilla was both burnt AND soggy, and those two characteristics are the only memorable ones. The mug the waiter brought tea in was also dirty and dust was caked on it...but the waiter was nice! I think the food is probably better if you've had a few, maybe 5, shots :/	0
I've been going to this place since I was a kid. Anything and everything I knew about Thai food was Thai BBQ. Ten years later, I've realized that Thai food is so much more but that's not to say that Thai BBQ is bad. In fact, it's really delicious. I love their beef satay with peanut sauce. Their rice is also yummy. Now, I don't know how authentic the food is at Thai BBQ but I do know that it tastes different from all the other Thai places I've been to. Some would say that this raises some flags and makes people suspicious but I would say that this is actually a good trait for Thai BBQ. The food is great and the service is good enough. I would come during lunchtime where there is actually parking to be found (the parking lot is tiny - so beware). There may be quite a wait during lunch and dinner times so also be prepared for that. I live in the Bay Area now but every time I come back to LA to visit family, I always seem to end up at Thai BBQ.	1
Absolutely the best place to get a delicious Reuben and brew fries in town! My favorite dive on the Eastside of Madison.	1
Beyond not impressed. We came for Valentines Day so it was a set price, limited menu thing. Arrived on time only to be wedged into our tiny table "like sardines" (sorry for the cliche but it fits), rushed through the utterly forgettable (almost bad, actually) meal and then rushed out. We left what felt like 30 minutes later almost $300 poorer and with hoarse throats from having to yell at each other over the din. Bad taste in mouth doesn't begin to cover it.	0
Came here on opening day and tried the Dirt Dog. It was delicious! The owner, Richard, was an awesome fella. He gave us the fried Twinkies to try out. Those were delicious as well! Will definitely be coming back regularly. Also good to know that part of their profits will go back to the local community :)	1
I had the best ramen noodles at Ippudo Westside but the waitress staff there is extremely racist. I went for dinner with my wife and son. My wife ( who is Indian) and son received courteous treatment and I was completely ignored ( she did not ask how my meal was and refused to clear MY plates). I am not sure what I did being I am always very nice to restaurant staff. Even when it came to paying to bill. I presented her with my credit card and returned it to wife for a signature. I did not make a fuss and took the high road even tipping her 19% of the bill.<br><br>I have traveled all around the world including Germany and received better service than Ippudo. Very sad experience in my home town of NYC.	0
It pains me to say that I never really frequented the food truck. There was always such a long freaking line, and when I&#39;m out in the world, (out on a dirt lot, really, as food trucks often are) the only things I&#39;m wont to wait in line for are the little boy&#39;s room and booze.<br><br>Why does it pain me? A truck full of cheese. I really shouldn&#39;t have to explain myself.<br><br>Anyway, when I heard that Ms. Cheezious was opening a brick-and-mortar shop, I felt like a schoolgirl again.<br><br>This past Monday, friends and I made our way up Biscayne for a cheese overload.<br><br>The restaurant is pretty much all bar. Which I, of course, love. I&#39;m not saying that there aren&#39;t tables. But the long bar (running along the entirety of the restaurant), I think, stays true to Ms. Cheezious&#39;s humble beginnings. It&#39;s almost like you&#39;re still ordering at a food truck. There&#39;s also a pretty fresh outside area with mismatched tables and chairs. Benches juxtaposed against a glass patio table and such. Feels homey. Feels like parties at my family&#39;s house. Where everything is bought secondhand: accommodation in lieu of taste.<br><br>I ordered the mac and cheese with bacon and the Croqueta Monsieur. The former was great, though I will say that next time, I&#39;ll get the plain mac and cheese. It has really subtle, mild flavors, and the bacon totally overpowered it. Truth be told, I at most of the bacon first and then went in for the mac and cheese. As for the latter, well... when have croquetas NOT made something better? Croquetas and ham and swiss cheese and bechamel pressed perfectly between sourdough bread. It was a wonderfully regional take on a sandwich classic.<br><br>The service was great. The staff seems cool and eager to help. Next time, I&#39;m taking down the southern fried chicken and waffle melt. And taking out the cute server. You know. If she&#39;ll let me.<br><br>If not, at least I&#39;ll still have fried freaking chicken.	1
Super excited about this new spot in PdR!! Triple is great but you can&#39;t move! They are not fully opened yet but its already very good. Wine selection is great, the few appetizers i had were delicious. Servers are nice. Will go back, soon... Like tomorrow...!	1
Never trust a bartender who pours aviations freehand.	0
Food is excellent. Servers are so friendly. The bolognese is to die for!!<br>Even though it seems to be new, they know how to run a restaurant! The server was cracking jokes with us all meal and made sure that we could make it to out show on time. He recommended dishes for us and was overall fantastic	1
If you do not try this restaurant, you are truly missing out, and not in a good way.<br><br>The atmosphere will have you feel like you have been transported to Venice (trust me? I was in Venice this summer.)<br><br>The service is absolutely spot on, five star dining. Knowledgeable, caring, and friendly staff make this place stand out.<br><br>The food is off the charts wonderful. Both of our entrees were outstanding. My gnocchi portion was borderline insane huge. The rich fontina cheese sauce was artfully paired with radicchio for a slightly bitter balance. Spot on!<br><br>The breadbasket served with olive oil and lentils was amazing. A very welcome change from the awful store bought rolls most serve. This is a true breadbasket with focaccia, breadsticks, crusty Italian bread, and whole wheat as well. Truly old school Italian!<br><br>My recommendation is to not miss out on this place!<br><br>The price is not cheap, but you pay for what you get. The price you pay is well worth what you get!	1
I was not very impressed, particularly given the good reviews this place gets. The meat steak (?) on the nachos was chewy and seemed to be of poor quality, and my burrito was average at best. The flour tortilla also smelled strongly of raw flour, which I found odd, and also really unappetizing. Given all of the really great Mexican food that's out there, I don't think I'd try this place again.	0
As a former server, bartender, hostess and manager--wow. never have i been so astonished and offended. Terrible beyond horrifying service. Was accused by the manager of doing drugs in her establishment. And trust me I wouldn&#39;t be writing this review if that was even close to the truth. She kicked out both my friend and me, who were catching up on our summers over a couple of beers. When I asked her what the reason was for this, she responded, &#34;Honestly i think you&#39;re on drugs.&#34; I guess all skinny women who go to the bathroom after a meal and 2 drinks are on drugs. I PAID my $70 bill, and I&#39;ve regret it every day since. <br>If the owners care at all about customer service they&#39;ve already fired this judgmental oaf of a manager who knows nothing about business or hospitality.	0
Had a great late breakfast and loved it, I 'll definitely coming back...	1
Favorite burger in LA. <br><br>It brings you back to the classic, simple, cafeteria style burger. It&#39;s refreshing considering the over dramatized burgers that are all the rave now. <br><br>Burger. Fries. Coke. Banana cream pie. Golden. <br><br>Not a place for groups. And be ready to fight for a seat- it&#39;s not a place for the weak willed: Counter seating only	1
great pizza!!	0
It's not delicious	0
Food was OKAY but that is it. Special fried rice was average. Honey Garlic chicken was normal. Szechuan beef was horrible and tasted like it was drowned in A1 sauce. Dim Sum was pretty good I admit. <br><br>I have never had the worst customer service ever! We waited 30 minutes before having to get up and tell a very reluctant waiter that we are ready to order. After we got our food and ate it we waited another 30 minutes before having to ask another waiter to give us the check and he gave the most nasty attitude. We never got to see our first waiter after that. <br><br>I would not recommend this place to anyone. There are much better places in Miami with way better service and prices.	0
After reading the menu online I was a little nervous about this restaurant; there were no vegetarian or vegan options that weren&#39;t on the wine list or in the side section. Upon arriving the restaurant was completely empty, which seemed odd for a Friday at 6PM. The decor was nice and the ambiance was romantic. Everything was very clean. I explained to our server that I&#39;m allergic to gluten and he nodded. Again I was nervous because he didn&#39;t seem to understand what I meant. This made me nervous but I just wanted to be sure I said something and move on to the rest of my needs. I wasn&#39;t certain that he understood me... at all, so I ended up ordering off the &#39;sides&#39; part of the menu out of fear for my intestines. The patacones, maduros and papas fritas were good though nothing special. The maduros had been sitting for some time and had lost their crispyness; probably prepared in advance. The margarita was rimmed with iodized table salt which struck me as low brow and they didn&#39;t have mojitos even though they were advertised as a happy hour special and on the regular menu. We spent a lot of time looking longingly for waiters who avoided eye contact and seemed engrossed in conversation with other employees over smartphone games and what might have been a new register. I DO NOT recommend this restaurant for people with food allergies, vegans or vegetarians. I also don&#39;t recommend this restaurant for anyone who likes vegetables, lighter fare, or customer service.	0
We were in town for only 3 days and ate at top name restaurants. B&amp;B was the best - by far.The food was tasty; the menu an experience. I asked the waiter why it was all in Italian without translation. He replied that Mario wants it that way, so that the guest and waiter have a conversation about the food. It's worth it - we learned a great deal about each dish. There was no hurry to turn the table...they want you to stay the whole evening and enjoy! It was worth the $$$!	1
This place is definitely overrated and overhyped. I have wanted to try this place for a very long time since moving to Miami because of the high Yelp reviews and being featured on Food Network, so my boyfriend and I came here in the middle of the week during dinner time to avoid the crowd on weekends.<br><br>First of all, we waited for nearly 10 minutes to have someone seat us (as the sign said). We had to get someone&#39;s attention.<br><br>After they told us to take a seat anywhere, it took them another 10 minutes to take our order. FYI this place was not even that busy when we came. I was already getting very frustrated with this restaurant for its VERY BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE. Mind you, I know this is Miami, so there is bad customer service almost everywhere you go. But this time, it was overtly bad.<br><br>I ordered the fish sandwich (con minuta) that everyone is raving about. Honestly, it was ok, not all that special. We also ordered the fried fish. Again it was not as amazing. <br><br>After our disappointing meal, it literally took them another 15 minutes to get our bill (My boyfriend literally had to get up and ask for the check).<br><br>OK FOOD. VERY VERY BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE.<br><br>I really do not understand the hype of this place at all.	0
A great place to go to get abuse from good looking waitresses.	1
The truffle burger and the grasshopper ice cream sandwich were the tastiest things I've ever had at a burger place! Gourmet gourmet...can't wait to go back.	1
Went to Roy's Baltimore on a Saturday and the last night of Restaurant Weeks. It was very busy but the staff handled it well. Dinner was delicious! We each selected something different from the special menu and everything was great! Definitely would recommend the Wild Mushroom Soup. Best I've ever tasted. :)Everyone wanted an extra Chocolate Torte to take home!Definitely visiting Roy's again. And, make a reservation.	0
Not good for vegans (vegetarians, ok, but not great). Sun is a bit too direct. Ambiance is nice otherwise, and the view is great. Service is good, but the waiter was just a bit strange (nice but strange). Pricey too!	0
This place is great. Ordered the curry puffs and the pastries were fried to perfection. The pad sew ew was awesome. The restaurant is great for dates with dim lighting. Decor is very modern. Highly recommended.	1
This is my first Yelp review in a long time, and my first 2-star review at that.I was hoping for a good bowl of pho, or at least a decent one. What I got was a disappointing bowl with flat and bland broth. It wasn't inedible--I did eat the rare beef and well-done brisket, as well as the noodles. But I usually finish off the broth, just not this time. Strangely, the basil and the jalapenos that came with the pho were also bland and tasteless. Where was the flavor in all of this? I only had flavor in my meal because of the Huy Fong sriracha sauce. And no, I'm not a fire-eater who's burned out my palate. Thinking back to the menu, the only beef choices were rare steak, well-done brisket, and meatballs. No tendon, no tripe. It makes me wonder whether the blandness of the broth is caused by the not using all the beef parts.Maybe this place is more about the garlic noodles and five spice chicken which other Yelpers seem to rave about here. But if you want better pho in the Inner Sunset, go to Yummy Yummy, even if you have to wait in line (although there's never been a line whenever I've gone there, but it is always busy). They have much more satisfying pho there.Service isn't great here. While I do appreciate not being jumped on to have my order taken at the minute I sit down, I didn't need to wait ten minutes in a not-so-busy place for someone to come by. And I had to ask for water--the waiter never asked me if I wanted something to drink.As I walked out, I noticed an empty table by the window where two barely eaten bowls of pho sat. Had I noticed that before I went in, I probably would have kept walking. And that's the other thing...when in the world were either of the two employees planning to clear that table?	0
Loooove this place. BYOB-- say no more. But the tacos are awesome, great place for a group too. It can definitely get crowded / there can be a wait. And parking sucks but it&#39;s LA so get over it. Must get the chips &amp; guac. must must must. Other than that a great gringo mexican place with a nice atmosphere and friendly service.	1
KogiKing, apart from being a bit pricy, was absolutely delicious. Service was good, there was no wait, and the food was plentiful and mind-blowingly good. Korean BBQ is mostly about the quality of meat and they have it down. A part that is just as important but usually plays second fiddle, are the side dishes. The kimchi was tangy and spicy and as it should be. The rest were so good I have forgotten even what they were because I ate them so quickly. I would recommend the all you can eat for 18$, if you want to try the exotics. Post 10pm, you can get a real deal 12$ for unlimited orders from a more limited menu. It doesn't get much better. Enjoy your KBBQ!	1
I&#39;ve been in the local area for 6 months for work, and have gone here at least two dozen times since I arrived. I really wanted to like this place, because I thought this would be a fantastic way to experience a variety of Cuban cuisine. I&#39;ve also varied how I&#39;ve interacted, from sitting in the dining room, ordering at the counter, or at the window, patio and delivery. <br><br>They are consistent. I&#39;m not ever fully pleased however. They recently took the fish ceviche off the menu and have only shrimp, and added $1 to it. the rice dishes seem to lack seasoning. the meats are usually over salted. I&#39;ve tried most of the daily specials, many of the sandwiches and a few american style favorites. I&#39;ve tried to stay within the Latin/Cuban side of the menu as much as possible though. <br><br>I&#39;m never able to find a server that speaks English, and I feel like I&#39;m the one that&#39;s out of place. and maybe I am. I just don&#39;t think this place speaks to my palette, and more often than not, I find the service sorely lacking. additionally, they have the audacity to print suggested gratuities on their receipts. <br><br>I&#39;ll be glad to leave Miami here soon, and I don&#39;t believe I&#39;ll be missing this place.	0
Don&#39;t come to this place when there is so many better places in Brickell Mary village to eat. Bad service, food took over 25 minutes to get to the table (on a Thursday night). And when I cAlled my server over, she put the hold on hand gesture, Like oh hell no! First me and my hubby ordered Mac and cheese and they served it to us like it was the first course, like if they are so upscale or something then we waited 25 minutes for a chicken Cobb salad and a terryaki plate. Which turned out to taste like crap. I barely even ate my salad cause the chicken was so dry!!! Don&#39;t come here	0
Had a great time drinking and dancing here a while back (even though the DJ was just OK, I was with good peeps), would like to hit it up again. Drinks were average price ($5 beers) and the crowd was trendy/young.	1
I have to give Pedro's a good news, bad news review. I tried the Camarones wrap - big mistake. The shrimp were barely warm and slimy. The rest of the filling in the wrap was also unappetizing; shredded lettuce and maybe some tomatoes in a disgusting creamy sauce. After 2 bites I had to give up, I couldn't choke down any more.	0
What is so sad is the food wasn't that bad. I ordered the chicken pot pie which was actually pretty damn good. With a nice flakey crust. The Arnold Palmer alcholoic drink on the other hand was poorly made and took forever to get to my table. The service was atrocious, where my date asked for a lemon wedge and they never brought it.. all the way to the bill coming to me with a double charge on the drink.. whomever is the owner of this joint needs to eithe retrain or hire a new staff.. because the way it is going "The Wood" will be left in the woods.	0
Doing a cross country road trip means you get to utilize yelp to its fullest potential and this is a prime example of why I'm a true believer of Yelp.	0
It's attached to the Hilton Baltimore Inner Harbor but better and less expensive than most hotel restaurants. Did not try the buffet. Plenty to enjoy found on the menu. Bagel/lox plate especially good.	0
Had a groupon, so I thought why not? My husband and I ordered the southwestern tater tots to split. We LOVED the citrus sour cream on it as well as the underlying taste of the tater tots themselves. Definitely excellent. We each ordered a beer on special for happy hour, in the bottle. Each were only a couple of dollars and very good. They had a very decent beer list. As we often do, we ended up getting the same main course, the sunset burger. It was served on a ciabatta roll and the burger itself had that chargrilled flavor, but could have used salt in my opinion (easily remedied). I liked the guac served on it along with the bacon jam. The egg on top is typically over hard, but I ordered mine over easy, and they did a perfect job of leaving the yolk soft but not too runny. Very good burger. I got the salad side with it, my hubby the fries. Fries were spiced and battered, he was a fan. The side salad was basic mixed greens, good amount, and the sundried tomato dressing was great. Overall a very good meal for the price. The service was not the best, but fine. We will definitely go back. Excellent deal with the groupon, but good prices even without. They had an all you can eat fish taco special and an all you can eat fried fish special tonight for around ten bucks and we saw they do a Wednesday all you can eat pizza deal for $11. If you are really hungry, worth checking out for sure.  Nice place for a casual meal and drinks.	1
Food is ok not more then that I can even say less then avg---- but VERY EXPENSIVE. Service was the worst I see in my life!!!! Will never go back	0
I am actually devastated that a review I wrote for this place in May is gone. I am actually shocked that so many people enjoy this place. For starters, I think that there is something truly brilliant about farm-to-table, and support Northern Spy in their efforts. I will also preface this by saying that I am a relatively well-rounded eater.<br><br>My at the time boyfriend really wanted to go here, claiming friends of his raved about it. I being open to hearing the opinions of someone who lives in the city and should know something about good food obliged, yet somewhat hesitantly. <br><br>For general discomfort with the sheer number of pork options they had on the menu, I decided to stick with the polenta and eggs dish, with braised collard greens. It sounds delicious. What came to me, however, was an utterly disappointing soupy dish that made me feel like my greens either weren&#39;t strained enough or I should have been eating it with a spoon. My companion&#39;s dish was equally unimpressive, yet for some reason he loved it; he ordered a butternut squash risotto which looked and tasted nothing like risotto. I feel like they could have called it butternut squash in rice. Better risotto exists from the freezer. <br><br>I will say this: the pickles are amazing. Our waitress was incredibly sweet and brought us a few. Peppery, crisp with a great bite to them. If only the rest of my meal was as satisfying as they were. <br><br>I would love to be proved wrong about this but for the portion size and the cost, I can&#39;t even think of spending the money there when I can spend time elsewhere.	0
I used to come here all the time but lately the food looks disgusting and old. I stopped by the deli about two weeks ago to pick up some soup and everything under the glass look atrocious. Honestly it looked like everything was made about two weeks prior... All grey an crusty looking. I wouldn't be surprised if people got food poisoning from the food there...	0
Nooooooo. This place .... ugh. It was such a beautifully sunny day that eating out on a patio seemed like a good idea. So we strolled on over and this seemed like a place that would suit all of our palates and plus there was outdoor seating available. The service was fine but let me tell you about the experience and the food. Ev-er-y-one walking by had a dog, combat boots, hair that hadn't been brushed in weeks, ray-bans, a backwards hat, an oversized shirt, and was just overall soooooo hardcore into that grungy hipster scene that I felt I was in some sort of twilight zone. And I also just need to say that as I was out there sitting and trying to enjoy my food, some dude picked up his dog and was petting it all crazy and I could see all the dog hair flying my way! It was soooooooooo gnarly. I was trying to cover my plate meanwhile wearing a terrified look on my face ... YUCK! yuck! yuck!The menu had the right idea but unfortunately it just wasn't amazing. And I feel it could have been with a few minor adjustments. I ordered the boneless fried chicken. The batter was ok and everything and there were two really huge pieces of chicken on my plate, but inside was a little dry and it didn't have any umph. The creamed spinach, which I was all excited about, came cold and that confused me. It needed to be served warmer. The mashed potatoes looked promising but they were flavorless. There was a hint of this random sauce on like part of my mashed potatoes that ended up mostly underneath the little creamed spinach dish, and it had potential to be a nice gravy for the chicken, but it was almost unintentionally there. So there was that. Anyway, I was also interested in trying the bleu cheese tator tots, but a girlfriend had tried them and said they were super mushy inside and didn't really hold their mark, so I didn't get them. I saw someone else that got them and they really didn't look that good. Hmmm. Same girl, her fish and chips were hella chewy. ??? Brussel sprouts were decently cooked but had no flavor again! :(I wouldn't go again and if I did I would bring a shield to protect from all the dogs sneezing and shedding all over my chicken! And some seasoning salt for that matter!	0
This new Portuguese restaurant opened its doors last Friday, it used to be El Gallo Portuguese O Fernando Restaurant, and before that it used to be a wine-tasting spot which I never had the chance to try. Not many people are tempted to try Portuguese, and why so many of these types of restaurants are popping up around Old (old-location) Lisbon is beyond me.<br>It seems like this little strip in the mile is constantly overlooked but has a lot to offer. <br>The service was superb and the food was very true to it&#39;s heritage. It was a bit cold and the decor was all wrong, but who cares when service and taste surpasses your expectations. I have high hopes for them.	1
I love- <br><br>The energy of the restaurant, delightful for brunch!<br>The quality of the food- always healthy and fresh!<br>The peanut butter and coconut cupcakes.<br>The soups- defrickenlicious.<br>The whole grain pancakes with berries, bananas and carmelized pecans.<br>The Portobella and The Favorite omelet, sooo gooood.<br>The salads, get a half size, they are huge. <br>The cappucinnos with the tiny choc chip cookies on the side. <br>The service is always great!<br><br>What&#39;s sucky-<br>The parking.<br>The wait.<br><br>But I keep going back!	1
I liked it!	1
Just ordered for delivery from these guys for the first time- the Portabello Burger was delicious- as was their Banana Shake... a welcome addition to the neighborhood:) Only thing is- the salads get expensive when you add a burger to them, so its better to just sub the fries for a salad instead if you are looking to eat a bit healthier! They delivered very quickly and the order was accurate.	1
Overpriced and okay food.	0
S1 all day! I used to frequent this location a whole lot when I lived in the LA area. Ever since I joined the Marine Corps, I make it a point to stop by here when I come into town to visit family and friends. If I ever move back to LA, I will pick up where I left off with this place. I love this spot, love the atmosphere, and love the food especially the S1 Thai barbecue chicken with rice!!! The location is a little janky, but if you are an Angelino, you'll adapt. Happy eating!	1
Nice place with a great staff. Food was good but nothing to write Grandma to! I had the Margaret's Pork Chop. Good but not the best. Nice presentation. Thick pork chop surrounding with some creamy kind of radishes but bland. Pork chop was on the dry side.	0
This place deserves the full five stars if it were a bit bigger. Maybe it was the fact that it was so packed with the FiDi lunch crowd that made the place look a little on the small side. Other than this, there is NOTHING wrong with the Melt Shop. I ordered the Burger Melt on multi-grain toast and it was delicious! I guiltily indulged in this cheesy pleasure and oh was it worth it. The burger patty was excellent, the cheese sauce and burger sauce were delicious, but what I loved the most was the generous amount of sauteed caramelized onions. The bread was perfectly toasted - Cheesy deliciousness in every bite. They have an extensive variety of grilled cheese sandwiches, salads, even milkshakes. I&#39;ll definitely be back to try some other goodies soon.	1
Service: This place seems to be more take-out than anything elseFood eaten: Super burritoPrice: OkayWould I come here again: No.So I came here a few weeks ago after finishing a pretty good workout so needless to say, I was starving. I came stopped here on my way to a friends place because one of my friends told me that I have to stop by here if for nothing else but the tomato salsa, which they are known for. I like the fact that they give you a variety of choices for tortillas and beans, which is always a plus in my book. So I'm standing there waiting in line to place my order and this place is just packed. Good sign right? So I place my order and ask about having my salsa on the side and getting extra. The girl helping me says, ya, not a problem as she starts taking the order from the person behind me. Great, everything is looking good and I can't wait for my food. So I wait. And wait. And wait. I see several people who came in after me get their meals before mine. I continue to wait. Finally after waiting for 20 minutes, they finally call my name. At this point I am so hungry I just don't care anymore plus I'm freezing to death cuz I'm still in my shorts. So I look in the bag and see that there is only one thing of salsa so I ask the guy for another. $0.50 he tells me. I just look at him like are you kidding? So I say forget it and just take off. At this point I am really hoping that this place lives up to its name cuz damn, I am pretty annoyed. So I get to my friends place and try out the burrito thinking that its going to be on par with El Faralito or at least be slightly behind. Its not. Far from it, its a pretty standard burrito. So then I put some of this "famous" salsa on it thinking that it'll do the trick. Nope. Nothing special to me. Needless to say, the burrito was a disappointment to me and for the 20 minute wait I endured waiting for this thing, it just wasn't worth it. For the price and half the wait time, I can visit my favorite burrito joint in the city and get twice the burrito with 4x the taste all for the same price!Its a pretty safe bet that I won't be eating here again.	0
We were surprised after reading the website and some reviews to be really disappointed in Seaglass. While the wait staff was very good, the food was not. The lobster bisque was intense and sort of smoky and had little lobster in it. My salmon would have been fine except for a heavy brown sauce which completely covered up the flavor of the salmon. The paella was sort of broiled, very dry, and the rice which is meant to be saffron and on the creamy side was incredibly spicy and totally overpowered the dish.	0
OK, my friend told me about this place because of their &#34;amazing tacos&#34; that were the best in town. I went on yelp and saw good reviews about their burgers and decided to give it a try...<br>I pulled into the parking lot and walked to the window to order, and a guy named Allen greeted me. The friendliest customer service I EVER had. Allen and his nephews working there make u feel right at home. I ordered a cheeseburger with egg and bacon, fries and a strawberry lemonade (homemade)<br>The wait was only about 10 minutes, an it was the biggest and most delicious burger Ive ever had! <br>The strawberry lemonade was amazing!<br>I went a second time to try the turkey tacos, and again, AMAZING.<br>Allen and his nephews remembered me, so they win an extra point for great service.<br>Third visit I tried the burrito, and it was HUGE, but I&#39;ve had better burritos. <br>Definitely amazing service with delicious food...try the tacos and burgers and you&#39;ll be hooked. <br>Just make sure you pay attention to your surroundings...it&#39;s not in the best of neighborhoods.	1
I&#39;ve been going to The Other Room for several years. It has been one of my favorite places in NYC since stumbling upon it years ago. Because of my fondness for The Other Room, I&#39;ve brought many, many people there over the years, and I&#39;ve often had friends meet me there before going out for the evening. It&#39;s one of my &#34;go to&#34; places in the West Village. There is something about The Other Room that just grabs me...it&#39;s small, intimate size; the somewhat quirky ambiance; the wine and beer selection; and--until today--the excellent service. <br><br>However, tonight, at around 7 p.m., I had the single worst experience from a service provider that I have ever had! The bartender, a person named Woodrow, was so bad and so abusive that I think he could be mentally or emotionally disturbed. Whatever his issue is, he should not be employed in the service industry. Woodrow took offense to me (in a manner that was completely inappropriate and uncalled for) and actually castigated me, interrupted me, yelled at me, disparaged me and called me names from behind the bar! I&#39;ve never experienced anything like this in my entire life! I am neither young nor inexperienced. I am adult, well-traveled, experienced and, dare I say, somewhat worldly and urbane. And, to the largest extent possible, I am always polite. I honestly think Woodrow might be disturbed. I intend to reach out to the owners to let them know how unsuitable Woodrow is to being a bartender. I wish the interaction had been filmed so they could see it for themselves; I am owed a formal apology.<br><br>Also, immediately prior to writing this review, I glanced at the other recent reviews that have been posted in the last six months to see what other people have been saying. I see that six out of the last twelve reviews are negative and that several of them very specifically mention that the bartender was downright rude! What are the owners thinking? Haven&#39;t they noticed there is a problem? Like I said, I will be reaching out to the owner in the next few days to make sure they know what is going on with Woodrow. I&#39;ll post an update after I speak with them.	0
Really hoping this place is not going to go out of business! Everybody needs to go check it out.<br><br>We just moved in around the corner, and even though I thought their sushi was good, they seem to have entirely gotten rid of that portion of the menu as well as their pressed sandwiches and are instead focusing on their bowls and paratha tacos. The sashimi bowl was good but I still recommend the bibimpap with beef, as that was the best thing I&#39;ve had by far.<br><br>Hopefully they will make a website and get their word out!	1
we fear change	0
Food and beer selection are great! Had pan roasted pork chop, it was excellent! Everything looked good on the menu. Parking is hard to find, use valet!	1
So, this place is money. Both my fiance and I are from North Carolina, and we went to school at Chapel Hill and are new transplants to Chicago. I got a recommendation to come here from a manager (I think?) from another restaurant saying their friend chicken biscuits were amazing.<br><br>The experience just brought us back to NC, and seeing the photos of iconic restaurants in Chapel Hill was really fun!!<br><br>So we went today on a Sunday, and did not have to wait for very long. Things I loved:<br>1. SWEET TEA on the menu! Brings back memories. And bottled Cheerwine!<br><br>2. Their fried chicken is made to order, so it was PIPING HOT. You can&#39;t hate on them for waiting esp. when everything is made to order vs. a Bojangles where the chicken is just picked up and fried in bulk. I got the spicy half chicken + the biscuit and mac n&#39;cheese. The chicken was super tender - even the breast, and the fried parts were oh so good. Corn flaky type of crust. I can&#39;t believe I ate everything. <br><br>3. Biscuit - very buttery and flaky!!<br><br>Things I felt they could have done a tad better:<br><br>1. The spicy is not too spicy. We did not try the Nashville hot, but maybe next time! The spicy is not a cajun spicy, i can&#39;t put my finger on it.<br><br>2. The biscuit is good, but falls apart so it&#39;s hard to eat it in sandwich!<br><br>I really like this place. We will come back. Love the fact that there is free parking off the street! hurrah!	1
Definitely not the same one on travel st. food does not tasty at all, very disappointed!	0
Let me start by saying the food was good, once I got it.<br><br>I came here for a business lunch with the rest of my coworkers from my office. I ordered The Outlaw Burger, and I ordered 2nd out of our line of 7 people.<br><br>We all went to sit outside and wait for our food. Fast forward a bit to after everyone else has their food, I decide to go in and see what&#39;s up with my order.<br><br>The lady checks my ticket and goes to see where it is. She comes back and tells me &#34;it&#39;ll be right out&#34;. I wait another 10 minutes and see many other orders come out, but not my order. I ask again and she checks again, then tells me &#34;just a couple more minutes&#34;. 10 minutes later I ask her &#34;am I going to get a burger today?&#34;, so she checks again. 5-10 minutes after that she comes out and says &#34;they have it on now&#34;.<br><br>A full hour after I ordered, after all my coworkers have finished their lunch, and after every other table in the place received their order, they finally bring my burger out. I had to take it to go, since I spent my whole lunch break waiting for it.<br><br>The guy who brought it out was nice and threw in some fries, but I was upset at that point. I paid $13 for a burger, even left a good tip when I signed the receipt thinking I&#39;ll be the nice guy who tips at these places, and the lady who caused all of this didn&#39;t even attempt to apologize.<br><br>Needless to say, even though the food was decent, they just lost business from 7 locals, out of which I was overly excited to try the food here.<br><br>We most likely will never be back.<br><br>Thanks for the fries, mr. server.	0
Let me start off by saying that I usually love this place and would give it 4 stars. However, my experience at brunch yesterday was terrible. My friend and I came by for brunch around 10:30am. There was one bartender, one server and one busser on staff which is definitely where the problem began. We were seated by the busser (who was awesome, and shouldn't be blamed in any way for poor service), and had to wait a full 20 minutes before even being greeted by the server. I ordered a coffee and then proceeded to wait another 20 minutes for the cream I requested, which was useless by the time it arrived as the coffee was cold. The server who was absolutely spacey, took our orders without writing anything down which was also a red flag. When our food arrived, my order was completely wrong. The server repeatedly tried to shove an omelet in front of me while glaring at me as if I were incompetent. After I refused the food for the third time he finally decided to give me what I ordered (which took another 20 minutes). My friend was forced to wait for his food as well while mine was being re-prepared, but the server brought out his original plate of food which was freezing and congealed. The server then offered a rather muted apology and that was it. We were also not offered refills of coffee or water until we had paid the check. What was really devastating was that the table right next to us had the exact same thing happen but their messed up food was "bought" by the horrendous server. Seriously!? Why would I not get the same service? I haven't been this disappointed in a restaurant in a long time but in this case it was all the servers fault as the food was still good. I would strongly suggest adding a person to your brunch service or getting rid of this useless one as he singlehandedly ruined a beautiful Sunday morning.	0
why I ended up here I really couldn&#39;t tell you. for a place that made me wait 15 minutes for a table, the food was confused as to what it was trying to be and mediocre at best. had to pour an entire container of salt into my recommended bean soup (something I never do) and the two salads at the table were lame. the place was decently priced, could&#39;ve been worse, but by no means worth an evening of your time. reminded me of the restaurant in &#34;Grandma&#39;s Boy,&#34; except my waiter&#39;s name wasn&#39;t Shiloh.	0
Their rice game here is ridiculous. <br><br>My BFs grandma grew up in Indonesia and that cuisine isn&#39;t really available anywhere, but Malaysia shares many similarities so we thought to bring her here. She ended up not coming, but the BF,my MIL and I went. I kinda know a bit about Malay food, but they have a picture menu binder they give people as well as a regular text menu which was helpful. <br><br>We ordered: <br><br>BBQ Pork fried rice - it had really nice flavor, the bbq pork was sweet and succulent and the rice was really soft and fluffy, not greasy at all. My only critique about this is that it had large slices of red onion which would have been okay well cooked, but it was a bit raw.<br><br>Rendang Ayam- I&#39;m a big fan of the bold thick rendang and this one was definitely hitting the mark in flavor. This is a bone- in, skin on chicken so it was more flavorful with that, but it makes it a bit messy to eat. The portion was about half a chicken so they give you a sizable amount. I will be ordering this again, but with a red meat as I think that holds rendang flavors well. <br><br>Captains Noodles - we got it w/o shrimp for the MIL but it was still good. These are saucy noodles, swimming in a sweet soy based sauce which was good but maybe a bit sweet for me. <br><br>One thing I oddly have to rave about is their rice. Their fried rice and plain white rice was so soft and fluffy and well seasoned. It&#39;s harder to achieve than you would think to hit that mark, but I love it when I could find it. I only keep brown rice at home now, so it&#39;s a rare treat to find good white rice when eating out. <br><br>This is a halal place and so the meats reflect that. The chicken will be more &#34;chicken-y&#34; as this isn&#39;t your big farm mass produced usual chicken. <br><br>We ordered grandma food to-go. Chicken satay was rather small, but decent enough. It is really sweet though so we did a bit like &#34;thai style&#34; and dip a little vinegar onto them to balance it out. She wanted kari ayam curry but with fried tofu and they accommodated it for us. It was alright, rather tangy of a curry. I wasn&#39;t a fan and neither was she though, but it might just not be in our taste. <br><br>Service was decent here. Our drinks were refilled before they got were empty. <br><br>Now I want more fluffy rice.	1
These are fine sandwiches.	1
This place has seen its day, I came early for breakfast as it was like 9am on a saturday and we should have gone to a diner. The clientel was very interesting to say the least but that is neither here nor there. I dont know how our server was, some completely apathetic woman took our order and we never saw her again, no one checked on us and we had to flag random people down to get things. It took 45 minutes for us to get our breakfast, I had eggs and my husband had this yogurt/granola/fruit dish. It was suppose to have raw honey on it and it had 1 drop on top (we looked all through it). Mine was just ok, nothing exciting. Aside from the service this was the worst part. I ordered a side of bacon, how can you mess up bacon?? When we got it, it was cold and a weird texture so i gave it back...they bring it back to me, not fresh bacon they just threw it in the deep fryer again. i know this because I saw the piece i took a bite of. The taste/texture was terrible, I cant believe they would serve this. I can&#39;t prove it but i really feel like they took that bacon from someone else&#39;s dish who didnt eat it. I am disgusted with the place. I refuse to go back...ever.	0
You can&#39;t make a reservation and trying to go with a group is a nightmare.	0
What can I say? They treat me like family and bring a new meaning to the word friendly. <br><br>Everything on the menu is delicious, and the Berry Wonderful French Toast is to die for! None of that packaged toast in egg shit. This is the real thing, only better. It is one of my life goals to have that dish named after me.<br><br>They serve breakfast all day, and the prices are oh so decent. <br><br>Just don&#39;t go on weekends from breakfast to lunch, especially on Sundays, unless you don&#39;t mind waiting for over an hour to be seated. However, I&#39;m not going to lie; I&#39;ve definitely waited for over an hour during a toast craving because it is just. that. good.<br><br>Sure the place is a little small and the tables are cozy (close together), but it&#39;s a fun, friendly environment... unless you are the princess from The Princess and the Pea. Of course, then nothing will satisfy you, will it?<br><br>Park on the street (metered parking), or park on 1st street (parallel to 3rd) for free. There is usually ample parking on 1st; just be careful about street sweeping hours. Perpendicular streets are by permit only.	1
I don't go out to brunch often, so when I do, I only order the best breakfast dish: Eggs Benedict. Stephi's knocks it out of the park. I've had this dish over crab cakes, short rib, and now lobster! Thanks for making special brunches extra special.	1
Damn, what a way to impress Giraffas.<br><br>This review really isn&#39;t based on my experience, but a friend&#39;s, sort of(?)<br><br>Me and my friend went on a Saturday night, and it was somewhat busy. The cashier had a positive personality and even kicked a joke that the place was closed -- I wasn&#39;t buying it -- the place is bright orange, and I think orange makes me hungry. <br><br>In my opinion, Giraffas&#39; the Pei Wei version of Brazil. The minute you walk in there&#39;s these huge screens that display their foods, logos, etc.<br><br>You take a menu, you look at what you want --- typically burgers or grilled items --- and you order through the register.<br><br>They give you a number; you sit down.<br><br>We both ordered the Sliced Picanha.<br><br>Mind came out in reasonable timing (no silverware); my friend&#39;s food; however, did not. <br><br>By the time I finished my meal, my friend was already asking for a refund. He literally had to chase down the worker&#39;s wondering where his food was.<br><br>Besides that one guy at the register, the staff members here lacked communication and support. Totally uncalled for, and I won&#39;t be returning anytime soon.	0
I guess this place thinks it&#39;s ok to change hours and not post anything online or change their message. I called 3 times on Sunday to check if they were open, hours, and the message said they open at 10am on Sunday for brunch. No special note on their site either......so I went there. Note on door said special hours, and when standing in front if their door, they finally picked up the phone. Then I read these pretty poor reviews, so in the end, I am very happy I didn&#39;t eat there, and never will!	0
Loved the garlic bread, &quot;Sunday Gravy&quot; was great! Enjoyed our waiter very much	1
Went here on a Saturday afternoon and it was busy. A little bit of a wait, but I wasn't starving so I survived. This is a cute place with very traditional flare. Reminded me of my time in Japan...So they have bento box lunch specials. Yum. I went for the sashimi, sushi, and tempura. And my foodie mom got the soba and tempura. Served with miso soups and rice of course. The tempura was really good. And you don't see it much, but they give you the ground ginger? and wasabi to add to your sauce for your taste. Little details like that surprise me. With our food and two cold green teas (canned), it came out to $30. Not too bad considering we had a lot of food. Really curious about their sushi now...	1
Yea, they have a store front! Now I don&#39;t have to go trolling Roosevelt at night searching for an arepa. <br><br>These arepas will definitely kill you eat them too often, but luckily Blink fitness is opening down the street this fall. Convenient, no?<br><br>My suggestion? Go, get an arepa de choclo (arepa with cheese and butter). Then don&#39;t eat for the rest of the day because it&#39;s huge. Oh, and don&#39;t miss out on the pink sauce (mayo and ketchup). Sounds strange, but is good on most foods. Pair it with hot sauce and you are set.	1
We keep going back, at least monthly, for the scramblers. Awesome scramblers, with hash browns and toast. I like the Popeye - with spinach, tomatoes, and feta - but have like all the others I have tried too. Can't beat a flavored mimosa or two while you wait for take-out. The carrot cake is amazing.	0
Excellent authentic Thai food. We ordered several items for delivery, all of which were fantastic! The delivery took quite longer than expected, but I guess that sort of comes with the territory of a new business. This place is a welcome addition to the neighborhood!	1
I was excited to read there&#39;s Sapporo style ramen noodles in Vegas so I made it a goal to try Ramen Sora. Sadly this place did not deliver. The broth lacks flavor and is overall bland. I relocated to Vegas from SF where we are truly spoiled with numerous ramen joints. I&#39;ve also had ramen in LA and this place falls at the bottom of all the ramen places I have been to. <br><br>My husband and I came in at lunch on a Saturday. Upon entering the establishment we noticed they only really have ten small tables and the place was pretty empty for lunch on a sat	0
Over the years Highland Park has gone through a gentrification age. This place is walking distance from my house and I must say that it is refreshing to have something different other than delicious taco trucks. <br><br>I ordered the chicken salad sandwich on sourdough bread and it was absolutely delicious. It was fresh, neat, and very flavorful. I was pretty darn impressed. I also ordered a side of pasta salad and it was perfect the vinaigrette they used in it was not too sweet or plain... Perfect balance. However I am giving it 4 out of 5 stars because I didn&#39;t get enough pasta... Maybe less than a cups worth? <br><br>Regardless, this place is awesome! Friendly service is a huuuuuuge plus! Welcome to the neighborhood Monte 52!	1
We have been to the Chocolate Bar before... and maybe the thrill is beginning to wear off... But that is not to say it is not well worth a visit and it was for the most part delicious and we both ate enough chocolate by noon to &quot;nourish&quot; ourselves the whole day !All of the chocolate was wonderful and the chocolate creme brulee the best I've ever tasted and the canoli shells were fresh and crisp and the fruit for dipping in the chocolate fountain was fresh crisp and ripe.However, the one uniform criticism we both had (and we even discussed the thought that it might possibly have been previously frozen ! - sinful in that venue and at those prices ! !) - the one uniform objection was that all of the &quot;cake&quot; confections tasted stale - not moist and fresh as you would certainly expect.If you put on this $42 extraveganza only once a week (Saturday midday) - then you bake fresh every week  - Right ? --- evidently not	1
Disappointed :( It was dark and dirty. The bathrooms were disgusting. There were small nats flying around and the food was blah. Our waitress was very nice and the over all service was good, it was everything else that was blah.	0
i was debating whether to stop at Jjanga or Sushi House Goyemon -- i so wished i went to Goyemon instead because I did not have a good experience at Jjanga. <br><br>we got there a little after 12:30pm and it was not crowded. We were seating and ordered right away. The menu says you have 45 minutes to eat for AYCE lunch. The service was SUPER slow. I didn&#39;t get my 2nd plate until 45 min later. I was thinking, they better not kick us out, I&#39;d be so pissed.<br><br>The first round of hamachi looked incredible and tasted great. The 2nd round of hamachi were poor looking and was warm temperature! <br><br>The only fish that tasted fresh were hamachi and salmon, the rest of the fish, i can pass. <br><br>I just cannot stand sashimi to be warm -- just not sanitary! <br>and these fish weren&#39;t thick cut either.. they&#39;re quite thinly sliced.<br><br>some of the rolls were okay; spider roll was fine. I wish they would serve us faster so I can try different items. <br><br>the waitress wasn&#39;t great also, she forgot one of my order and charged us for dinner price instead of lunch. And no matter how i try to make contact with her or wave my hands around, I cannot get her attention at all! I was just annoyed. I was very temped to just walk out the door and not pay because service was that bad. <br><br>no, i will not visit Jjanga again. I was glad that I didn&#39;t bring friends here, it would have been an embarrassment.	0
Be ready to order when you walk up to the counter, otherwise, check out the board on the walk and then fill out the sheets. Mia Za's tries to keep the produce and meat local. They're trying to be as green as possible. Great atmosphere to boot!	0
Went there to interview a couple people, and it was nice. Nice + low key. Food was tasty, and service was good. <br><br>they had a pickled platter- I could have eaten like 10 of those. <br>The atmosphere was pretty cool too!<br><br>overall, a good experience!	1
Very Disappointing. Have been to 5 different Nobus. Have been to the one at Caesars palace twice before. Had my first mediocre meal tonight. The service was rushed. The new Sashimi was tasteless. The only drinkable Sacki was $40 a glass (I tried 3 others), The Sushi was worse then I get in Michigan. The Tuna was very red. Wonder if it was gassed with Carbon Monoxide to get that color. Maybe they have over expanded.	0
greasy stuffed little cheese fingers that are a snack for on the go. I definitely can&#39;t see myself having these everyday.	0
I can't remember the last time I got this much attitude from a bartender. She wouldn't even look at us while asking us if we wanted to order. I felt like I was putting her out when I asked for a glass of water (while she was filling up 2 already). Of course I had to wait 10 minutes and ask again. It wasn't even busy, perhaps 10 people at the bar. I got some advice for you, Alyssa Milano wannabe, slap a fake smile on your face and add a smidgen of eye contact and you'll see you tips sky rocket. First time, last time for me.	0
Yum! I&#39;m so glad this place opened. My girlfriend and I tried the sashimi-bap, the regular bi bim bap, and the kimchi panini.<br><br>Bibimbap - fresh &amp; healthy. A lot less rice and a lot more veggies than I&#39;m used to getting from the suburbs. I agree with the previous reviewer - the extra $1 for the black rice is absolutely worth it. Ingredients were super fresh and you get lots of food for your money.<br><br>Panini - a korean variation on a grilled cheese sandwich. Delicious, very cheesy but not greasy. I didn&#39;t expect to like kimchi in a sandwich but it&#39;s really good, more sweet than sour. <br><br>We didn&#39;t try any of the sushi rolls but we&#39;ll definitely be back for them.<br><br>Now if only I could get my favorite, dolsot bibambap, closer to home.	1
My friend and I went in to have dinner at Little Bear for the first time. Our waitress Jenson asked us if we had been there before. We told her we had not, and that we had no idea what kind of beer to order. She asked us what types of beers we normally liked, then recommended amazing beers that I've never even heard of. The atmosphere is beautiful, bright, and open. And the food was AMAZING! We ordered the brussel sprouts and the firecracker shrimp as appetizers. My friend had the Little Bear Burger, and I had the flat iron steak; they were both to die for. Needless to say, we left happy and full of good food and beer. I will definitely come back for a date or dinner with some friends. I'm even considering having my birthday dinner at the large table in the dining room. I heard they have an amazing brunch, so I'm excited to try that out soon too! All in all, we had wonderful experience!	1
I&#39;d been dying to try this place since I moved here 3 years ago. SO DISAPPOINTED.<br><br>Maybe I&#39;ve been spoiled by growing up in the south, but NO!!!!!!<br><br>The gumbo: watery. The lemonade: also watery. The pecan pie: dry.<br><br>If I come back, maybe I&#39;ll try the catfish or jambalaya. I&#39;ll give GJC the benefit of doubt --it seemed like the drinks (that I did not try) were better than food. Or maybe you get so drunk that the food tastes better.	0
Overly trendy, way too crowded, extremely over priced, portions are very small, staff is very rude and do not communicate with each other, way too small, not a fun place.<br><br>It&#39;s like every other place in downtown or hollywood...I&#39;m better off staying home lol	0
I love this place because it's a late night diner, a great place to go after partying. I always get their mac daddy cheese balls and tuna melt. It's soooooo good. Everything else is pretty good, their juicy lucy burger and their salmon stack are amazing.It's like a take your buddy for a quick bite kinda place, nothing fancy.	1
Everything was amazing! Authentic Thai food at great prices. Highly recommended!	1
Went here with a group of friends for a nice dinner out. The place is awesome, the service is friendly, they just need to get their menus/cooking a bit straightened out.We ordered two bottles of wines for a group of 6 and they were both fine. No issues with the drinks at all.But food wise we all ordered various things:Appetizers:Stuffed Green Olives with Lambs - A couple of my friends got this, I didn't try it but the main fact is that when the dishes came, there were no olives on the plate. Instead it was a plate of salad with 4 lamb meatballs. We asked our server who then confirmed that we were correct, there were no olives so they just had the lamb meatballs tonight. My friends said they were fine to eat, but just in principle they surely didn't get what they had ordered/expected to eat.Crispy Ahi Tuna Tartare - Again some of the other people in our group got this for their appetizer. Let's just say it wasn't really ahi tuna, but more fully-cooked tuna eggrolls. Again, they were fine but not what was expected and definitely not ahi tunaSmoked Salmon and Grits Pancake - This actually came out the way it was expected. I had a bite of my friend's and it was alright. Not absolutely amazing but the grit pancake had a nice texture to them. The salmon was nothing our of the ordinary and the crab was a nice touch.Capay Farms Organic Greens - With my love of beets, I got this salad but was sad to find only 2-3 small pieces of beets when my salad came out. As a one out of three of the ingredients listed, I was hoping for much more but was sad to find a measly few.Entree:Grilled Pomegranate BBQ Kobe Sirloin: I think 3/6 of my friends got this dish and was not very impressed with it. For me, it was very odd to find that two of them seem to have gotten 'filet mignon' cuts and then the third got a VERY marbled piece of sirloin (more so like ribeye even) cut. They all said the sauce was a bit overpowering, I had a taste of the meat. It was ok. My friend definitely had hers requested at a Medium and receive it more so on the rare side. Again, another friend had tons of fat on his making it less like a sirloin.Pan Roasted Fresh Scallops: I got this dish, which ended up being more of a pasta dish. There were maybe 3-4 small pieces of scallops and even then, when I was chewing them, I definitely felt some pieces of sand or something that made crunchy noises. In addition, the dish wasn't very hot which made me think it had been sitting there for a bit and thus was not fresh. I didn't even finish the dish, I got a bit turned off 1/4 through it.Grilled Romesco Muscovy Duck: This was a pretty good dish, I think from what my friend had said after eating it. She did say though that it was dressed a bit too much with the sauce and it was overpowering for duck.Dessert:It was a friend's birthday, so we asked to have a mini celebration for her. They came out with a cheesecake, which even between the 6 of us was NOT finished. And this cheesecake was NOT that big (maybe 4" in diameter?). The cheese did not taste like it was made with the correct type of cheese. A bit too intense for cheesecake.Overall, the food was a bit of a downer. However, service was absolutely amazing. She was sweet enough to give us the cheesecake and a small bottle of bubbly because we were celebrating our friend's birthday. I think I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and say it was an off night for them especially since all the other reviews are full 5 stars! Give them some time since they just opened up and return back in a few months and hope for better. All in all we had a grand time, but the food wasn't what we expected nor did it blow us away.	0
Boyfriend went here yesterday and had the eggs Benedict, it gave him VIOLENT food poisoning.When I called the manager to let them know they had poisoned someone who lives in their neighborhood, he said "that sometimes happens with eggs Benedict".Wtf?This place won't last long if that's how they treat the locals!!Yuck!	0
Came here for breakfast and had the Fulton breakfast sandwich. It was delicious ! Scrambled egg topped with avocado on a cheddar cayenne biscuit. The biscuit isn&#39;t the traditional southern crunchy exterior and soft flaky interior type of biscuit. The flavor put me more in the mind of a jalepeno cornbread muffin but not as dense. The biscuit was light soft/chewy-in a good way. <br><br>The food came out relatively fast although the couple next to me complained at how long their order was taking. <br><br>The space is on the smaller side. Simple menu but the food is pretty impressive. Will be back soon !	1
Meh. I've experienced better is to say the least. lol. Postives:It's a locally owned, older dinerIt seems like it's got the menu and decor down for a breakfast dive (I say that in a good way)Sourdough is good (and I'm REALLY picky on my SD!)Negative:You're waiting in line for well over 30 minutes on any given weekend (I waited 45 minutes just to "wait to be seated" for a party of 2The food is sub-parThe eggs are mehThe hashbrowns are meh (mush like Denny's or any other greasy nasty place)They made french toast on white bread just the old fashioned way as if they're lazy... nothing is special hereThe service is kinda slowThe truth:It's not that bad of a price considering it's LA, the wait is pretty obvious: breakfast places have followers right? And lastly, if I wanted cheap crappy food I'd just hit up Denny's for a little less on price and a cleaner looking kitchen. I would never return. ever.	0
The coffee is good and the bakery is perfect. Their quiche is ridiculously good... Great crust great consistency wonderful flavors. It's busy for a reason and the line moves really fast. I wish it was open later but that's my only complaint. They only take cash but there are two ATMs within 40 feet of the place so c'mon...it's no big deal.	1
YUM! I&#39;ve been to HB for dinner on a regular (weeknight and weekend) evening two times and for a private party that closed the restaurant to the public and both experiences were fantastic. Pleasant servers who know their stuff and an enticing menu. I<br>This tiny little storefront restaurant is cozy and deeeeelicious! Between my three visits I&#39;ve had the lentil soup twice and it&#39;s great. Definitely do yourself a favor &amp; get the halloumi cheese dish, it&#39;s still a wonder to me how this cheese can be grilled without melting but the firm texture &amp; salty flavor (similar but not as salty or crumbly as feta) knock it out of the park every time. <br>For entrees I&#39;ve had the grouper nicoise which was scrumptious and the vegetable and ricotta pie which is vegetarian comfort food at it&#39;s finest. <br><br>my boyfriend and other dining companions have enjoyed every other dish on the menu so it seems like you can&#39;t go wrong!	1
We love this place and eat there frequently. Wednesday evenings are crowded due to 0/2 price beer &amp; burgers so it affects both time and (sometimes) food, otherwise highly recommended. Menu list is pretty short, but the quality is very high and service is usually outstanding.	0
Eric was excellent.  He was attentive and considerate.  The food was outstanding, the atmosphere was  very inviting.	0
If you're looking for a sit down dining experience that's quick and delicious, this is the place for you.	0
I was craving for samgaetang for awhile and could not find any good place near Long Beach on yelp. After reading all the reviews on Yelp, I decided to give Mountain cafe a try. <br><br>Mountain cafe is indeed a hole in the wall type of place. It&#39;s small inside and most of space were used as a kitchen. Waitress and cooks are all middle-aged Korean women. It reminded me of home cooking. Waitress was very friendly even though we spoke no Korean. <br><br>I ordered samgaetang and was surprised with the portion. The baby chicken was served in a big boiling bowl. The soup was light and I get to season it myself. It&#39;s my first time to try samgaetang. I didn&#39;t know what to expect. I admit the soup was not as flavorful as I imagined it. But it was not bad either. <br><br>Hubby ordered kimchee stew. He loved it. There were some glass noodles and rice cakes in the stew. I liked his too. But what impressed us the most were the side dishes. The marinated daikons were crunch. Homemade kimchee&#39;s the best I ever had. If I live/work close by, this would be my No. 1 comfort food choice!	1
I got the chimmichuri sandwich, which is basically a ton of chimichurri and some steak on some ridiculous bread, pressed, cuban style. It&#39;s a great little space, and you got the arty kids coming in and out from next door. Definitely heading there more often.	1
great view of DTLA. grab a glass of wine and enjoy the view	1
My girlfriend was craving pizza for lunch and I found Steve&#39;s Pizza on urbanspoon. I read F&#39; off I&#39;m Full&#39;s review and thought this would be an excellent place to try out since it wasn&#39;t a chain like Pizza Hut, Dominos, etc. We ordered a whole large pizza since it was &#34;cheaper&#34; but the total came out to ~$23 for their &#34;supreme&#34;. Wait time was about 15-20 minutes. The crust was delicious! But everything else was &#34;meh&#34;. The green pepper and sausage didn&#39;t seem too fresh and the tomato sauce tasted a bit plain (not enough salt?). All booths were filled so you may need to wait a bit if dining in. I&#39;m not deterred from this place because I could have ordered the incorrect specialty pizza. Next time I&#39;ll try something more popular and plain like pepperoni. The price should be in the $$$ $15-$25 range for specialty pizzas. $$ $10-$15 is for one topping larges.	0
One of the best places ever!<br><br>(Location)<br>In the heart of Little Tokyo.<br>Downtown.<br>Arts District.<br>Need I say more?<br>You&#39;ll be fine during the day or at night.<br>Just don&#39;t stray too far.<br>Parking is ample, but that&#39;s relative to day and time.<br>There are a lot of flat fee rate parking lots.<br><br>(Inside/Outside)<br>You&#39;ll notice the character of the restaurant stemming from the outdoor section.<br>The alley is legit.<br>There is an indoor section, but there&#39;s no reason to go inside unless it&#39;s busy.<br>Trust me, you want to eat outside.<br><br>(Food)<br>My initial outing here I couldn&#39;t even remember what I got.<br>This time around I was feeling spontaneous.<br>I&#39;ve been eating clean for a while now...<br>But there was something tempting about the PBJ Bacon Burger.<br>And dude...<br>It was bombacious.<br>I can&#39;t even explain it.<br>There was a party in my mouth with every bite.<br>I even called my Mom.<br><br>Check it out son!	1
Everything was fabulous! From our fireside table to the most inventive crab &amp; oyster dishes.It was our first visit to The Inn at Perry Cabin. We had had a lovely time and enjoyed 2 dinners and a wonderful Sunday breakfast at Starr's . The service was attentive, professional and friendly. If we did live so far away, we would be returning sooner than later!	0
We had 3 cakes and a coffee - all very, very stale. Sorry but we won't come back again	0
Good fried chicken. Like homemade. Order ahead they make fresh so it takes a little while.	1
I always love this food....but service has been going down hill....I don't expect 5 star service but 15 min wait just to get water and menus.....still waiting for someone to take out order.	0
The best cacao in miami period!!! Very cheap prices great place!!!!why go to a fritanga when u can go eat at a restaurant	1
headed to Crusprior to a show at MGM. Great food, excellent service and the &quot;sweet Elvis&quot; dessert is not to be missed.	1
A one star love letter to Takara Ramen. How I miss you so. I have been going to Takara Ramen since it's opening almost two years ago. Their gloriously thick and fatty Tonkotsu was something that warmed my soul something fierce! So I was happy to see them achieve success and remodel. But when they came back as Urban Ramen, everything changed. The Tonkotsu broth became bland, thin, ruined. They traded flavor for a new hip decor and forgot what made them a great little gem in Hollywood. I've held this review for a while, hoping they would improve. But today I went back and it was the same thin, mediocre, lifeless husk of what it once was. I can't remember a meal that has made me so depressed. This is a one star review out of love for the old Takara. In hopes they remember who they are under their new fancy paint job.	0
This is my regular lunch time spot when I&#39;m at the office. I always get the Diavola pizza or the Proscuitto with Brie panini. I&#39;ve dined in two times and the servers are usually very friendly and service is quick. I typically order take out at least once per week, and when I call it&#39;s ready within 5-10 minutes of ordering. The food is pretty close to Roman authentic style Italian food. The small pizza is perfect for one person, but if you&#39;re really hungry, just go for the large. Their sister restaurant, Tutto Pasta is two doors down and is also really good, but I prefer my pizza and panini usually. The parking out front is meter only and very limited. This is also the reason why I rarely dine in. When I order take out, I&#39;m usually in and out within 5 minutes because my car is usually illegally parked outside while I run in to grab my food because there is never any parking. They also deliver so if you&#39;re in the Roads/Brickell area, I definitely recommend that you give this place a try.	1
Great service, great value &amp; central location. They offer a truly unique menu of delicious Thai cuisine, from the Satay to the Duck Curry, Bangkok-Bangkok will keep pulling you back. From a family night out to a romantic dinner for two, they offer a quaint setting for an enjoyable evening.	1
Here is a short list of how terrible the restaurant is:1) The smell of propane made me dizzy throughout the entire meal. 2) The server showed up to take our order- deliver food, and that was it. They also forgot our coffee and orange juice.3) The ambiance was hipster-shitty.... Dirty tables and unswept floors.4) the only saving grace was the pork belly.TLDR- gross	0
I had really high expectations of this place, and came away satisfied but not really blown away. I enjoyed a drink at the Lobby Bar just outside the restaurant, and then proceeded to order some dishes to eat family-style for dinner. The first to come out was the steamed dumplings, and to my surprise they were quite mushy. They fell apart in the grip of the chopsticks and despite being a bit of a mess to eat, were still quite tasty.<br><br>I got the Old School, a nice combination of bulgogi, glass noodles (also pretty soft), kimchi, scallions, and sesame. This was quite good, and the primary reason for this 4-star rating. Service could lag a bit at times, but the atmosphere was enjoyable and felt very modern and trendy. Valet parking is $8 for 3 hours with validation from the restaurant.	1
I gave this location 4 stars because I have only ordered a few things there and they were excellent. The Tilapia Fish Tacos are a beautiful thing, I also had breakfast there last Saturday and had Chorizo eggs with black beans and rice. It was another excellent meal and very well priced! I love the east side location, it has great character! There is talk of redoing the menu, dont touch the fish tacos!!!	0
I came here mid-afternoon after a long day in airports, on airplanes, in lines... hadn't really eaten much, but I had dinner plans so I didn't want to overdo it here. I explained my situation to the waiter in 25 words or less, offered up some options, and he steered me right to the fish tacos. Great suggestion... they were excellent. Grilled, fresh, flavorful, with some kind of fantastic sauce on top. They were substantive, but not heavy. I'm not sure if they're always on the menu, but if not, they should be.The ambience is laid back this time of day. I sat outside with the smokers and drinkers, though I was doing neither. It was pretty darn good.	1
I will keep it short.	1
My girlfriend and I decided to try COYO after attending an event in Wynwood. We had a hankering for Mexican. COYO offers a wide variety of taco varieties, as well as salads and burritos. The menu appears to replicate the kind of food you would find on a Mexican street corner or taco joint in southern CA. <br><br>Each taco variety includes two tacos. These tacos are the 4&#34; tortilla kind. Bite sized, but relatively filling. We ordered the Pescado (fish), al Pastor (pork), and the al Carbon (chicken). The al Pastor suffered from what seemed to be be poor quality meat. Our al pastor tacos were fatty and flavorless. The chicken tacos were a little better. The best of the night was the fish tacos. They were tasty. We also tried the guacamole...fresh and solid flavor, but I have had better. The chips provided were fresh.<br><br>Though they were busy the service was pretty quick. The location next to Panther is great, but unfortunately the food is less than compelling. The overall cost for two that evening was $40...way too much for tacos. I might eat here again if I&#39;m in the area, but it won&#39;t be my first or second choice.	0
Despite the name of the place, this extremely-popular food stand / open-air Cuban diner is probably more popular for the hot foods than it is for the fresh fruit juices. The food is usually very good, very filling, and very inexpensive, if very greasy and very salty.<br><br>The fruit juices are generally just so-so. If I get some food to go, I prefer to mix up my own juice at home.	1
I went for an extended 8 mile walk on Saturday afternoon, post-Badgers of course. My exercise brought me from Weston Place, downtown to pre-Freakfest activities and back home again, but not without a stop at the Blue Moon Bar & Grill.	0
Made my reservation on line. No problem getting in as we were a little bit early from our show. Had cocktails and were greeted with a complimentary appetizer as returning patrons. John was our server this time. He and his team were absolutely fantastic! The food, as always was superb! Everytime my wife and I go to Vegas, we always have dinner one night at Delmonico's. Had the choclate decedance cake for desert with pistachio ice cream....to die for! It was so good.	1
Overpriced, much better bun mee in the city. For what you pay it should taste better, but it is a solid choice if you don't mind being ripped off.	0
Was initially turned off by the decor when I considered this place for a date night, but then with a 4 yr old in tow, the booths were a perfect match. She loved her battered/fried chicken and chips, but it was unavoidably greasy. A side of veggies did the trick, and the food we had was even better. Shepard&#39;s pie was nice with the potatoes and meat in a skillet, then veggies on the side. Salad dressing was really good on mixed greens. Hamburger meat was also good, owner said it is dry aged. He also said they make all their own bread and sausages in house.<br>Looking forward to watching soccer here and trying some more of the food. Super service and nice staff.	1
One of the few Indian restaurant that offer foods from the southern part of the country! Great Sunday buffet too!	1
Little difficult to find but worth the hunt. Friendly wait staff and good food. Garlic bread, with every meal, was excellent, had trouble not filling up before the food arrived. The all you can drink wine is about what you'd expect, okay but nothing to write home about.	1
A pleasant surprise! At first glance, the menu seemed to have the usual heavy diner fare. After digging in, however, we found that there were tons of options, and many small twists on the diner staples. I was super-impressed by my MIL's pot pie - the vegetables were so beautifully fresh looking, and the overall presentation looked more Michelin star than greasy spoon. My breakfast enchiladas had a bright flavor and were not overly greasy, and the Boy's barbecue sandwich with fries were were satisfying, the barbecue sauce lacking the cloying sweetness usually runs into. Prices are decent, and the support staff were super attentive. If only our actual waiter had been so attentive...nevertheless, a great experience and a place to which we will definitely return.	1
I have been here a few times. <br>Food is great. <br>My favorite one comes with a plantain on top and on bottom, though that one tends to leave me a bit hungry. <br><br>Yelp has incorrect hours. CLOSED on Monday.	1
If you like your eggs with a side of attitude then this place is definitely for you. I guess I forgot to not wash my hair this week so I stood out like a sore thumb. Iced latte-total garbage. Green Jasmine tea-mediocre. Food-alright. Honestly, I've had way better at Jinkies. Just the overall feel of the restaurant was icky. Ugh, left such a bad taste in my mouth.	0
Wait was ridiculous. You pay by the pound, and after over paying for sub par BBQ you&#39;re not guaranteed a table because all the hipsters enjoy squatting after their meals. You&#39;re in NYC! When you&#39;re done eating gtfo!	0
BEWARE! BEWARE! BEWARE! Even though this place SAYS they are open until midnight, they stop serving dinner at 10p.<br><br>When I arrived at this place, it was nice and quaint. As I walked in I saw a sign that read &#34;please wait for a hostess to seat you&#34;. So I walked in and stood behind another couple who was waiting to be seated. We were waiting there for about 15-20min for this supposed &#34;hostess&#34;. I could tell the young couple ahead of me was getting restless, as was I. Several waiters kept walking by us (empty handed i might add) to attend the tables on the patio. But none of them acknowledged us. One waiter (who passed us 2-3 times) finally decided to notice us and informed us that dinner is only served until 10p. Which I replied with &#34;but aren&#39;t you open until midnight?&#34;, with the young couple ahead of me agreed with. The waiter in a condescending tone said &#34;We are, but after 10 we are done, you can sit at the bar.&#34;<br><br>So I never got to try the food there, but I don&#39;t think I will ever return with customer service like that. I guess when you yourself work in the customer service realm, your expectations are a little higher than most. <br><br>Booooo to Mohawk Bend.	0
I don&#39;t like to give bad reviews because I know how much businesses rely on yelp. This place seemed heavy on the concept and light on the customer experience. The &#34;flow&#34; of the restaurant makes no sense. You stand in line to order, then find a table for them to serve you. All the water and things are back over by the door (not just past where you order) so you have to double back. Its like they are trying to copy Urth cafe (also slow) or Native Foods (same concept, much faster) but you don&#39;t have anyone to ask to find the water and to speak to if there is a problem with your food. I felt like I was interrupting someone else from their job to get answers to find basic things.	0
Das ist Sher gutt! <br><br>I bought at least 5 if not 6 pastries home to eat for breakfast the next day. when I went out to the kitchen the next day I only had 1 1/2 left.<br><br>I will say that those 1 1/2 were wonderful. Cant wait to get back and buy some more!<br><br>DANKE!	1
Eggs Benedict with home fries- The English muffin and poached eggs were fine. Canadian bacon subpar, but not the issue! The hollandaise sauce was hands down the worst I have ever received in any type of restaurant(including ones where they use powder packets of hollandaise). It was broke and had chunks of curdled egg that were flat out gross!!!! The kicker, however; was the home fries!! Over boiled chunks of potatoes falling apart that did not have a single seared side on them, let alone a nice crisp outside. If you can't make home fries you should fired or pick a new profession, because you don't know what you're doing at all. I just can't understand how you can properly poach an egg, but not know how to cook pieces of potatoes on a flat top? Extra Extra WEAK Sauce!! I'm embarrassed for you!	0
Ah, breakfast. We were staying downtown for a wedding and I think we ended up here every morning for breakfast.Good and hearty.Also, quite busy.	1
Places like this are why I love yelp. With less than an hour for lunch while visiting from out of town, my wife and I were delighted to find this place. We shared a delicious lamb kabob - perfectly marinated and tender, with a simple rice pilaf and pita on the side. Super friendly owners, who answered all of our questions with grace and humor. Nice to know the lamb is halal.	1
I&#39;m not including any pictures because I pretty much demolished the food and beer before I remembered to take a pic. They have awesome AWESOME (and I know my beer) beer and their poboys are like out of this world. Michael, the bartender is so nice and on top of his game. My pint glass never ran dry. AND they have free wifi and great coffee to finish off the food and fanfuckingtastic beer? WHAAAAT! #heavenonearth I wish they were located closer to my home because I&#39;d be here like errrrrryyyyyday. Seriously.	1
I&#39;ve been here several times, and each time I always order the chicken shawarma platter. I&#39;ll consider ordering something else when I feel a little more adventurous! The first time I ordered it, the chicken was dry. I really needed the hummus to moisten it up. The following times I ordered it, the chicken was perfect.<br><br>I enjoyed the flavors of each element of the platter. The cucumber salad complemented the boldly flavored chicken and roasted potatoes. The coolness and acidity of the salad really balanced it out. The hummus was great too. In case your chicken is dry, it&#39;s there to make it go down easier. I like the rice too - it&#39;s fragrant and comes with these tiny noodle-like strands of something unknown. I still haven&#39;t found out what they are, but they seem to fit in with the rice.<br><br>They also have bottles of sriracha at each table. Score!	1
Best sliders in NYC, hands down. Also, the white sangria is on point. Make sure to make a reservation because they are pretty busy.	1
I ordered a catfish sandwich today. There was a strange chemical aftertaste in the bread. I order here all the time and have never had any problems so didn&#39;t pay much attention. It was only after finishing the sandwich that I discovered the lingering aftertaste, like some type of industrial chemical cleaning solution. Did someone forget to wash their hands (or take off their gloves) before making the bread? It was disgusting. This food made me burp a lot after eating and the cleaning solution taste would come up again each time! I had to go to the emergency room for dizziness and nausea after this. NEVER EVER coming back.	0
Great for lunch.<br>Nice and clean decor.<br>Friendly service.<br>Love seafood soup? try Yunpotang..<br>It&#39;s on point... <br>(especially when you have a... hungover)	1
Excellent pizza, insulting service. My party made the mistake of ordering dessert (a passable cannoli) after we had finished our pizza. What happens if you linger, for any reason, after they have arrogantly whisked your plates away is that you are immediately of no use to them as clients. Grimaldi&#39;s business model is: get them in, get them fed, get them out. <br><br>So after about 2 minutes into our cannoli, our (Serbian?) waiter shoved new place settings and silverware in front of us as if the next party was already seated. Their tables are small so there isn&#39;t a whole lot of room to maneuver at this point. A minute later, he dropped our check in front of us. We were miffed but were intent on enjoying dessert. A minute after that he dropped 2 large menus in front of us. At this point there is no room whatsoever. We reluctantly gave him a credit card at this point but made it known to the manager that the service was a joke. <br><br>I live here. I am used to rushed service but Grimaldi&#39;s is ridiculous.	0
This place is amazing! Everything is so modern and decorative. It's very clean and looks really stylish. After eating the food i could say that this will be one of my favorite thai restaurants. The service was impeccable . A must try!	1
We went to The Resevoir last night and it was AMAZING! We didn&#39;t eat but the menu looked awesome; all great food around $7-11 each plate. They have a huge/awesome beer menu, lots of local microbrews. The ambiance is a mix of wood and industrial touches; it&#39;s perfect. Plus it&#39;s open until 2am! I want to go every night.	1
Do not use as catering service!<br>This used to be one of my favorite restaurants. It&#39;s got a nice, very Brooklyn-y ambiance - i.e. tasteful art and chairs that don&#39;t match. It tends to be on the crowded/loud side, so it doesn&#39;t quite work for a romantic dinner despite the decor. It&#39;s consistently delicious food though - American with a twist. It seemed like the perfect option for catering my wedding this summer, but it quickly became clear that decision was a big mistake. <br>The person who coordinates the catering, Kristen, is really disorganized, and bad with communication and follow-up. One of the finer moments was when we were finalizing the menu. Our deposit had been put down long ago, yet the documents she emails to us show a different they menu and pricing structure than what we had been shared previously. Um, seriously? We haggled over transportation costs, as their quote was actually 3 times the amount of other caterers. We set up a tasting, arrived, and was informed there was no tasting. I was hungry and saw a bridezilla moment on the horizon. Fortunately, the owner, Tom, stepped in and the planning process got a bit smoother. Not smooth - just smoother. Less than a week before the wedding, they sent us an email with additional items that needed to be rented. Sure, no problem!<br>Then (cue dramatic music), the wedding day arrived. We had spent the majority of our wedding budget on the food, and the dishes did not disappoint. Planning had been a shit-show, but the food was good and I felt relief... Until I returned to the church the next day to pick up stuff, like the top tier of the wedding cake that everyone and their mom knows to save, freeze, and eat on your first anniversary. Well, everyone but The Farm on Adderley. <br>My advice? Let a caterer do the catering. The food is not worth the hassle.	0
This is place is extremely disappointing. Bottom line is, there are far better experiences on the West Side than this.<br><br>I had heard about the Apple Pan for a while as a return to the days of the classic burger counter. I love old timey nostalgic themes like that so I was excited when my gf and I decided to come here for lunch. <br><br>We came in around 1pm and the place was expectedly busy. We had to wait a bit but got two seats quicker than we expected which was nice. When we sat down the guy behind the counter immediately started grilling us (there is a burger pun here somewhere) for our order. I just asked for a coke which he handed me as a can, paper cone full of ice, and some weird metal stand for the cone which looks like the fancy thing that rich people eat deviled eggs out of. This wasn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing, just wasteful I suppose.<br><br>As soon as he handed us our drinks, we hadn&#39;t even begun to look at the menu, but he asked for our order. We said we are still deciding and he said ok, and that he would come back in 5 seconds. He was basically trying to rush us along. I understand it was busy, but I at the very least want some time to understand what I am ordering before I order it.<br><br>We finally placed our order, so this is a good time to talk about the decor. Again, I get it. This is supposed to be classic and nostalgic. It is meant to feel like an old time burger bar. Not at all. This place is just old and ugly. There is nothing good feeling about it. Its not even like one of those restaurants where it is so bad its good looking like a 50&#39;s style diner place. Its just plain bad.<br><br>All of that was still not enough to warrant 2 stars for me because I am generous reviewer. What was really the last straw for me was the food. I ordered the steak burger sans mayo and my gf had the hickory burger. I figured that since this plane is known for their awesome, amazing burgers, these would be life changing. This is definitely not the case. The beef is flavorless which probably means its bought frozen, not fresh. The bun is nothing special either. The burger itself is almost all sauce. They clearly have over sauced everything to make up for their flavorless meat. I thought this was a fluke but my gf&#39;s burger was drowned in ketchup and mayo. Mine was overpowered with the flavor of the sweet relish. Consequentially, my hands were also drowned in that relish. The fries were the saving grace because they were crispy on the outside and soft in the middle. They did one thing right.<br><br>Lastly, when it came time to pay, we got the bill but couldn&#39;t read it. I asked the server what the second number was. He takes the bill, re-does all the math and adds to the charge. We end up paying way more than we should have. Also, for any business out there being stubborn about accepting cash, get over yourself. You are losing customers who are increasingly NOT CARRYING CASH. Eat the 3-5% credit card fee. If that is going to ruin your business then you are doing it wrong.<br><br>Please avoid the Apple Pan. Do yourself the favor because there are far better options all around the Westside and Santa Monica.	0
This place was like a hidden gem for the day. I mean, going to jury duty and just sitting there is not the greatest, but after reading some reviews on yelp, I found my lunch spot. <br><br>The staff is absolutely wonderful. It took me forever to check into yelp because my phone was spazzing out on me but they still gave me the free drink per yelp check-in and took my word for it. There was this Asian guy who was super nice and engaging (when I was still trying to decide on what I wanted) and some other people behind another counter ok-ed whatever I asked them to give me (of course pricing was a little different but they made it work). <br><br>I unfortunately had to take a way one star because of how much food was offered. I was originally looking at the fruits and salad bar but before I could make up my mind, all the fruits were gone (I took a walk around the room to see all the options I had for the day)! I know i know, it was partially my fault for being so slow and there weren&#39;t many fruit bowls to begin with, but maybe they were packaging more but it was too slow? Anyway, I settled for the lentil soup and a side salad and was extremely pleased. I believe the total came out to be $5-$6; very reasonably priced<br><br>As for the view, I did not have a chance to go outside and enjoy it since it was a rather cloudy day; maybe next time I&#39;m in the area.	1
THIS PLACE!!! I have always had a less than positive view on Miami cuisine, but this place blew me away. From the espresso, to the buck crepes to the incredible desserts, we came in for something quick and fell absolutely in love with everything about this place! The service was SO good, this place is where you want to go if you want to eat really well made food and leave satisfied beyond belief.	1
Despite being located in a cool hotel and the fun location of West Hollywood, this place is a fat disappointment. The service is absolutely terrible. The food is sub par. The only redeeming item on the menu are the biscuits. Save your money, this place sucks.	0
I am sadly disappointed. I don't know if they have a new chef but I've been a faithful customer of LA Cafe and as of recent the quality of food has steeply declined! I usually order the roast turkey panini, chipotle chicken wrap, or the pesto panini. This last time I ordered the chipotle chicken wrap and pesto veggie panini, and must say they taste like they came out the trash. The best part of the meal were the buzz chips--which is not saying much. The panini had mushy tomatoes with a horrible aftertaste. It tasted like the chef took the tomatoes straight from the dumpster. Aside from the watery pesto sauce, the chipotle chicken was even worse! The wrap is supposed to have a chipotle sauce--hence the name-- but when I opened it, it had a mayo sauce. WTF?!?!? This place has officially lost a loyal customer.	0
A can&#39;t go wrong kinda place with an excellent beer list and food to match.<br><br>Interior has an upscale British Pub feel in one section with high back chairs, couches and dim lighting while the main dining room has more of an open feel, although still dimly and cozily lit.<br><br>Service was outstanding as I was seated in the bar / lounge area and my bartender was also my waiter. Never missed a beat. Always checking on me, refilling water glasses, etc. And doing it while tending to the main and service bars. A rare feat. Nice work.<br><br>Food was delicious, albeit a bit pricey but hey, this is Mag Mile. Paid $13 for a house cured pastrami sandwich with homemade gardenia salad, served on a pretzel roll and house made pickles. Sides are purchased a la carte so you could drop a bit of coin if you are hungry.<br><br>Beer list was well represented with a variety of styles, ABV&#39;s and local brewers. Prices ranged from $8 - $10 per glass but all high quality stuff. Tastes and flights are available and my server was well versed in the list and made a few spot on recommendations.<br><br>Only reason this place isn&#39;t a 5 star is the a la caret thing. If I wanted to do that I&#39;d go to Smith &amp; Wollensky&#39;s. Management might be wise to charge me $17 and throw in some fries with my sandwich. Just felt a bit punitive when I&#39;m dropping $13 on a sandwich and $10 on a beer.<br><br>Other than that, no complaints. A winner in anyone&#39;s book.	1
Food: 2.5 starsService: 3 starsValue: 3 starsWe needed to have a quick early dinner, so we stopped by this place. If you want some gourmet Thai food with comfortable environment, this is not the right place. King of Thai Noodle House is more a fast food place with affordable price. We had a roasted duck noodle soup and a stir fried noodle. I like the strong duck flavor in the soup. But there were only a few very tiny pieces of roasted duck in the soup. The stir fried noodle looked good, but it was too greasy, with cheap ingredients. Although the food inside the restaurant smelled good, the taste was okay. It is not good enough for me to go back. One try is enough!	0
The food is good. Service was great - a bit awkward at times because it was quiet in there and the wait staff tended to stand around and stare or hover.<br><br>It&#39;s a Mediterranean place that offers very few actual Mediterranean dishes. No lamb apart from mixed meat medleys and the lamb sliders (assumingly prepackaged and not fresh). Got the lamb burger sliders. The tiny little patties were yummy but three teenie tiny mini pita bread sliders with a small side salad was really not worth the high price tag.<br><br>The dips are okay. Hummus is bland - just tastes like ground up chickpeas - no spice or flavor. Better off buying from the store and eating it at home.<br><br>Baklava was super yummy. A bit pricey for it&#39;s size (again) and it was served with a spoon - what? Couldn&#39;t cut through it. Used the spoon like a mini hack-saw. Annoying.<br><br>The place is really redone inside and is cute but I the price to portion ratio killed it for me. Won&#39;t return.	0
This is a great place for special occasions because of the great service and attention to detail, and the upscale feel.  This is very similar to the Capital Grille which is also owned by the Darden Group in Florida.  It appears they both are concerned about making sure the customer's do not leave disappointed.  The food is always excellent, as we have been to the Seasons 52 several times.	1
What's so Korean about this place? Obviously it was not the food. I don't want to hate but there was nothing authentic about the food except the beer and soju.I was really excited about the Korean fried chicken but it was an epic fail, why? lacked flavor and the spicy wings were drenched with some tangy sauce. On the other hand the Korean spicy ribs was SPICY, one tiny bite and my mouth was on fire. The Kimchi fried rice, hmmm was A-ok. Would I come back? UMM NO!!! #FAIL	0
Absolutely disgusting.<br><br>I ordered the Arroz Con Pollo which is their house special. The rice was complete and absolute mush, absolutely overcooked and dry, mixed in with a little bit of shredded chicken and lacking any flavor. It tasted worse than a box of instant rice. The plantains were over-fried, and the black beans were nothing admirable. The whole dish was disgusting.<br><br>My girlfriend ordered the garlic shrimp with coconut rice. This was a very sad looking 7 pieces of tiny 41/50 frozen shrimp thawed out and covered with minced garlic. This was far from sauteed as the shrimp itself had absolutely no flavor once the mounds of garlic were brushed off of it. <br><br>When we spoke to the manager, he was completely aggressive saying that the food was authentic and that&#39;s exactly how gourmet Columbian food tastes. Mush and frozen low grade, unflavored shrimp is not gourmet in any country. Arroz con pollo is not mush.. for a manager to defend his mush rice and state it as authentic cuisine is sad.<br><br>After sending the dishes back, 2 bites in we left.<br><br>I do not recommend this for any type of authentic cuisine or service (it&#39;s incredibly slow).. and the interior is beyond tacky and obnoxious.<br><br>Why this place is so loved by yelpers is beyond me - there&#39;s better Columbian food to be had out there, this is not it.	0
Arrived on a Saturday around noon for lunch. Menu looked interesting and it was something different. And gosh it certainly was different. Ordered a grilled cheese and a cup of onion soup. 	0
Ever grateful to yelp for another excellent recommendation! I was in Seattle with colleagues for a conference and was not thrilled with the non exciting and very pricey restaurant suggestions of the concierge. Found the Pink Door on yelp and as it turns out it was barely a 10 minute walk from the Sheraton. Yes, it is a little hard to find but well worth the search. I did not make reservations ahead for the 5 of us which could have been a huge mistake as the restaurant filled up very quickly after we arrived. The ambience is lovely almost a throw back to the 30's. On Thursday night a 3 piece band plays jazz &amp; ragtime on the small stage which sits in the back of the restaurant. Last night they played a variety of Beatle songs. The music was not at all overbearing just very pleasant. Ok now onto the food--The appetizers were well priced $6-14 and portions were good enough to share. I had the bruschetta which was novel using peas and ? very good flavors blending well together. Others ordered salads of several varieties--again creative combos of beets/pistachios radishes etc. The waiter was very attentive and charming (Dylan). The main courses available included several vegetarian options as well as meats and some very wonderful Cod as the special of the day. The presentation was excellent and the fish was cooked perfectly -not dry or overdone. Other members of my party ordered pasta with meatballs as well as a seafood dish including shrimp and clams. Again, Dylan was most responsive when asked to personalize this dish by removing the calamari. All were very pleased with their meals . The night was completed by watching a charming woman seated at the bar in her very pink suit with very pink shoes and a lovely hat. She was so intriguing that we asked our waiter who this might be. We were informed that she was in fact a Seattle celebrity, Ruby Bishop, who had for years performed at the Pink Door and now could be seen enjoying the music of her former band members while tapping her foot every Thursday night. We stayed to enjoy the music without being pressured to leave. We were all well fed and opted not to add desert. The bill including tax &amp; tip was around $300 for the 5 of us--not bad for an evening of good food , lovely environment and great entertainment.	1
I&#39;m only updating because the service on my second visit was just blah. I mean, the guy was nice and all, but at some point it seemed that he was more concerned about talking to his coworkers/friends outside than to take care of me and my sister. The food was still good, but not as good as the first time. <br><br>Plus, and this was a BIG reason we left earlier than we had planned. If you come to our table, we&#39;re done with dinner, you ask if we want the check and we say not yet we would like to look at the desserts. Then brings us the menu, don&#39;t leave us waiting, and waiting, and waiting, no water refill, nothing else offered. <br><br>When we finally asked for the check, the guy didn&#39;t even remembered we wanted to order a dessert. <br><br>I don&#39;t know what happened, but is like it went from a quirky, cute and quiet place for dinner to another Miami blah restaurant where customers are left feeling like they are a hassle to the staff. <br><br>They have to shape up or go down the drain like many others in this city.	0
Amazing pho. Amazing prices. Spent $20 and walked out feeling stuffed great service. The owners are really lovely people. Food came out fast and was hot off the press. Yum yum. Will come here allllllll of the time now.	1
I am so bummed that this place is so far from me. I had such a good experience here.One: I love everything they're trying to accomplish with their ambiance/scenery. Whatever they're going for, it's working. The taco truck indoors thing? So cool. The artwork? Awesome. You go Glen Coco!Two: Portions are huge and food was yum. Menu is limited, but what they offer is tasty. Tex Mex, so not really authentic, but I ain't got no problems with Tex Mex! Had a torta and it was absolutely delicious. Plus, we found this place on a Groupon deal and paid virtually nothing. Calle Tacos, we robbed you blind! Three: Dranky Drank Dranks. You wouldn't think they'd serve alcohol, but they do. And I'm grateful.Downfalls: Well, it's right smack in the middle of touristy Hollywood, so really, when would I ever find myself wanting to go there except for those few times I'm in the area showing my out-of-townies Grauman's? Area is way too packed and touristy. Also, seating is limited. We happened to visit in the middle of a week day right after lunch and got lucky, but I imagine finding a table here is not easy at all. Better order to go.Even without the Groupon, this place is reasonably priced and delicious. Such a cool spot with an awesome feel. Next time I find myself strolling Hollywood Blvd with family/friends from Jersey and giving them the "tour," I'll be sure to stop on in for some grub and a margarita so I can get a buzz on before I show people the "Hollywood Sign" for the millionth time.	1
DO NOT EAT OR ORDER food from pizza extreme!!!! i placed an order through room service...my order taker I later found out her name was brittney refused to tell me her name. when I asked her to repeat my order back to me to ensure it was correct she would not say anything. .

Wonderful food, great ambiance. You don&#39;t need to fly to Japan for your next great Japanese meal, just go to Cocokala!!!	1
Dinner at chi SPACCA was overwhelming. If you are planning on going there, make sure you go with a group of friends so you can taste more of their different dishes. Unlike most other Italian restaurants, chi SPACCA serves really large portions. I had the honor to talk to Chef Chad Colby a little while we waited for our food and I asked him what inspired the huge portions. He told me that the large meat portions are all traditional Italian dishes and you have to think country-side farm-inspired dishes where all the dishes are meant to be shared.<br><br>Having said that, it explains why their Costata alla Fiorentina is priced at $210.<br><br>Happy Eating List:<br>1. Affettati Misti:<br>This assortment of Italian ham is a good way to start the dinner. The appetizer sampler gave a taste of a variety of different meat (sorry I can&#39;t remember their names). Other than that, it wasn&#39;t anything too special.<br><br>2. Tomahawk Pork Chop:<br>The pork chop was really, really well-seasoned and grilled to perfection. I noticed that the chef had to grill the pork for a while before we were served in order to cook through the thick cut.<br><br>3. Beef and Bone Marrow Pie:<br>I&#39;d say this is a definite must-try. The moment you slice through the pie, the juice on the inside of the pie oozes out. It was a bit of a surprise to us when we sliced through the pie. Nonetheless, it was an amazing dish.<br><br>4. Banana Mascarpone Crostata:<br>Another absolute must-try. The smooth texture from the mascarpone with the banana bits beneath all came together really nicely. This dessert is what makes me want to go back to chi SPACCA.<br><br>Not So Happy List:<br>1. Crostata alla Fiorentina:<br>Though massive, I did not think the steak was too special. It was definitely well-seasoned and well-cooked but it lacked the wow factor that makes me want to spend $210 on it again.<br><br>2. Pollo alla Diavola:<br>The only thing about the chicken was that it was slightly spicy. Other than that, I did not think the chicken was too amazing. It did not wow me like some of the other chicken dishes I&#39;ve had in other restaurants.<br><br>chi SPACCA deserves a second visit but next time, I&#39;ll stick more to the smaller portions so I get to taste more. Despite my comments towards its massive servings, I do think that it is a good place to go with a group of friends to share the food. Just be sure not to go with too large of a group because the restaurant is pretty small.<br><br>Happy eating,<br>Joey Wong	1
They say guys do stupid things for girls. The stupid thing I did was let my friend take me here. She always talks about going here, but never has it been in a good light. That should have been my first hint to say, " No, let's not go there after the Dodger game." Instead, I did a stupid thing and now I'm writing about it.On the outside, Fred 62's seems like a good idea. It's a diner on the corner. They've got some great music playing and for the most part, it seems like a cool place to go to. Then you get a closer look. This place is crawling with hipsters. I don't know about you, but I'm not a fan of the hipster scene with their hats and skinny jeans.As for the rest of the atmosphere, I guess it works. The booths are spacious and it's dark enough inside that you can easily ignore the hipsters.I'd have to say the food here is hit or miss. I had the fish and chips which is tough to do outside of a pub or somewhere by an ocean. The fries were good and the fish was ok. Overall, it was a miss but lots of places strikeout on that dish.The menu is huge and I'm sure you can find something good. If I ever come back, there were a few things I'd like to try. Of course, I'll do anything for a good friend so if she ever said let's go, I'd have a chance to try those few other things.The one great thing I can say about this place is it's the perfect drunken after bar hopping spot. If you're not sober enough to get to a Denny's, Fred 62's is an acceptable substitute. Actually, if you're already in hangover mode...the dim lighting is a plus. The food is perfect to soak up all that wonderful alcohol you had but beware getting sick afterward. Then again, you probably would have gotten sick without the alcohol.	0
Atmosphere is cool and modern -The food is so NOT!	0
Bad customer service from this little girl who does the drinks and smoothies.. She can't take 20 minutes just because she feels like it.. She has time to talk to everybody but not to do her job.. You guys owe me a smoothie now because it was paid already and after 20 minutes it wasn't even started	0
Craving BBQ and decided to place an order to go. Ribs pulled pork sandwich and sides. All were delicious. Definitly recogmend RoRo BBQ	1
Food is good... server's attitude is too aggressive. Don't recommend.However, the raw fish is still good tho worth a try	0
Five stars for breakfast, three for dinner. This is my fave breakfast place in LA. They recently started doing dinners too, and I found them disappointingly mediocre. For the same price you could be having an Office burger.	1
This is the best Mexican restaurant in my part of town Staff is great, food is excellent, atmosphere is fantastic. I would eat there everyday if I could (why don&#39;t I?).	1
As much as I would like to recommend this joint I simply cannot. Good music, location and setting but...that&#39;s it. Snob factor is too high- way better places right up the block.	0
The drunken noodles were so spicy they were unedible. The tom ka kai was extremely bland. Will not order from here again.	0
I finally got a chance to visit far bar today after being on my to-do list for some time now. <br><br>When I walked in there was nobody there and I wasn&#39;t sure if I was in the right place or not. I was directed to a back space (the front?) where there is a somewhat small space inside and some seating outside. <br><br>I sat at the bar and the bartenders gave me good service the entire time I was there. The selection of beers is pretty great tap wise and is supplemented by a solid bottle list including a ton of beers from Japan that I have never heard of before. <br><br>The quality of the beer was good and served in appropriate glassware. Prices were slightly high with only certain beers being offered in flights. <br><br>However, I did get some free tasters so that was nice. I would recommend this place but just beware that the parking and location might be a bit confusing if you have never been here before.	1
Underwhelmed...<br><br>The menu reads deliciously but the execution is lacking. My fried chicken was supposed to have a breast, wing, and leg. The leg was missing the thigh - perhaps a typo? Had a light and flaky coating but lacked seasoning. Breast was dry.<br><br>Mac &#39;n&#39; cheese was nothing special. Cavatappi in a thin cheese sauce which was sitting at the bottom of the bowl. The top pieces got no love.<br><br>The club sandwich was the best of the food we ordered but I&#39;ve had better.<br><br>IMHO, Stephanie needs to get back into the kitchen because I absolutely LOVE Girl and the goat.<br><br>The service, although friendly, was very spotty and impersonal. <br><br>The best part of LGD is the bustling bright atmosphere and a diverse mix of tune from Ella Fitzgerald to Led Zepplin.	0
Skip the flourless chocolate cake. Dry and burnt twice now.<br>Get side of chipotle caesar for burger/fries.<br>P.S. Groupon doesn&#39;t work on pris fix.	1
The pizza is okay. Notihng super special. Kinda awkward in there though cause everyone was elderly... Could've went to Cybelle's for cheaper and more distinctive pizza.	0
My life had been a sham up until last night. I have absolutely no god damn idea how I lived this long without KyoChon in my life.I had seen on Le Instagram that some people were posting pictures of this place, and was somewhat intrigued. They looked basic, and nobody appeared to be eating the traditional favorite-flavors like buffalo and lemon-pepper. "Oh well," I thought... so I went ahead and bookmarked this place as somewhere to try if I didn't know where exactly I wanted to eat, and what do ya know-- last night I had one of those moments and decided on this place.First off, It's in gritty-ass K-Town, the only part of L.A. you walk through expecting to see some lady about to get the business from a bandit in any alley way you look down. Just like any other place in K-Town, the parking situation is dismal. You're best bet is to try and find some street parking rather than taking your chances getting stuck waiting for a valet spot to open up. This however, did not necessarily deter me because at this point, the only thing going through my head was "fuck yeah I'm 'bout to eat some m'fuckin' wings!" The store on both the inside and out was very nice and very clean. When we showed up, we were seated immediately and it wasn't very busy.We ordered the KyoChon Wings, half-half (Hot & Sweet, Soy Garlic) and some rice on the side, because why in the world would you eat chicken wings without white rice? Yeah. The service was prompt and polite.God damn it. I've been eating chicken wings for 26 years and I ain't never had anything better than these soy garlic wings. The hot & sweet were bomb as can be also, but the soy garlic...Jesus. The skin on these was perfect. Non-battered, just seasoned and fried. You want something else, you can go sit with the trolls over at BWW or Hooters....or you can just order the fried wings or drumsticks here. Your call. By the time I was to the last wing, I was hoping that at the bottom there would have been a cyanide pill, a razor blade or a gun or something. Dude, I didn't want to live another second in this world without these wings at my side. Considering this was a bit of a silly thought to have, I decided to settle for some wet-naps, which they did bring out with the check. The whole meal is very reasonably priced. You can bet your sweet lil ass that I'll be reading my kids the KyoChon menu as a bedtime story, and that the story of my experience there will be on that is passed on from generation to generation.Update: My wife got pissed because I said my life was a sham up until this point at the top of my review. I know what I said.	1
This place was good, I liked it. The $16 burger was yummy, I ate it in about 3 bites I was so hungry! My vegetarian friend was also able to find a few dishes that she had a problem choosing between. Great little neighborhood joint, I would go back.	1
I used to go here often. Weekday HH, wkends and Sunday brunch. Really nice rooftop venue over looking the Pershing Square & the downtown. The view- It's gorgeous.1. I love the staffs there (the original clan)Super friendly & genuine people. Really hard to find that at trendy venues these days. Head security, bartenders to the door master are all really cool. 2. Trendy spot for age 30+ crowd. Always crowded3. Old fashion drink-FTW4. Line can be ridiculous, which means people are willing to wait to get in. 5. Brunch was really good. Sunday mimosas, lobster salad & seasonal oysters, with their specialty baked breads. Delicious!6. New management. They keep changing managers! I miss the old Perch vibe. Its different now =(7. Music can be better!! I do like how they mix up the music, from Jazz to Kaskade-alike-music, but sometimes, its bad. Good mix of different types of music is important. Some Fridays and Saturdays they have a DJ. Still, meh. 8. Street parking or Valet	1
So, within a very short time of learning about this place, I have been here 3 times already. I&#39;ve ordered the abalone porridge each time because it is outstanding. I don&#39;t know why the other reviewers haven&#39;t mentioned it... It comes out steaming hot with a rich and delicate flavor. <br><br>But what I really want to talk about is the service. The service is not bad, it is not rude, it is not offensive. It&#39;s just not overly-friendly either. From what I can tell, there are two main waitresses here who work at different times/nights. While one is definitely more smiles/sunshine/lollipops, that doesn&#39;t mean the other is all stinkface/raindrops/poop. The first time I came here the &#34;less friendly waitress&#34; was working and as soon as I got to the door she started speaking to me in Korean. Now, I&#39;m not Korean but I do look it (people tell me) so imagine her disappointment when all I did was smile at her and stare blankly. But despite my un-Koreaness, she still put away her new found hatred for me and promptly took our order, refilled our tea, and refilled our banchan. She didn&#39;t curse at us, spit in our food, or eat our souls. Now, I&#39;ve read some reviews about her giving people the &#34;stink-eye&#34;. I can definitely see how they felt that way but, in her defense, I think that&#39;s just her face...be nice. <br><br>So, if you feel like going here, don&#39;t sweat the service. If you want a hug and kiss with your meal, go to TGI Fridays...but I think you actually lose a little piece of your soul whenever you go there.	1
Knife. Years from now, when people look back to emulate or capture the essence of this generation, they&#39;ll recall that restaurants were often given simple nouns like Knife. Or Colander. Or Baster. You get the idea.<br><br>Other than my mild teasing, Knife is awesome! Great place for breakfast. I had a coffee and a bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich on a roll because I&#39;m a fat-fat and New York does that breakfast best. The guy behind the counter even kindly put a slice of mater on my sammich, though he may have done so with hesitation, wanting to charge me extra. To be fair, I asked for the extra ingredient while I obviously dropped a fat tip in his jar, which had a hilarious x-rated pun written on the side of the jar. You&#39;ll just have to visit to find out what that hilarious, x-rated pun was, won&#39;t you?<br><br>At any rate, the sammich was good, but not the best I&#39;ve had. The roll was great. The bacon was fine, the cheese was...I don&#39;t remember the cheese so I guess it was unmemorable but not bad. The eggs were scrambled. The coffee was also good.<br><br>The space here is small, and there are a half dozen or so stools next to a bar. It&#39;s near a school, so moms and pops come in and out with child in tow. It&#39;s nice. Looking forward to coming back.	1
What&#39;s the big deal? Perhaps after waiting 2-3 hours for a burger, people&#39;s taste buds become biased - you just waited 2-3 hours for this damn burger so it better be good, right?? <br><br>Wrong.<br><br>Thankfully, I only waited 20 minutes for a table. The truffle burger was so oily and fatty. The meat was very loosely packed that it fell apart while I was eating it. Some ppl may argue that is because the burger is juicy. No. FAT and OIL dripping down my arm does not equal juicy!<br><br>The famous truffle fries - the fries were too thin and flimsy to hold up to the heft of the melted cheese. The sauces that accompanied it were just eh. Their umami ketchup was pretty good though, and prob the best part of my meal.	0
I&#39;ll be honest - I wasn&#39;t too impressed with The Apple Pan.<br><br>The burgers were only average, and while the staff was funny, after about five minutes you mostly feel like the place is run by a bunch of ramblin&#39; old timers.<br><br>But I do love a classic diner, and the fries and pie do make up for the lackluster burgers.<br><br>However for the price, which came dangerously close to $20 a person, you can do much, much better elsewhere.	0
If you are looking for a unique experience this is a great restaurant to come to. When you walk into the restaurant you are immediately transformed into a rainforest, there are trees everywhere and they have candles lit. I came here with a group of friends for dinner. We had reservations, but called because we were running late; they were very kind and said no problem. I was a bit worried because we arrived at 10:15 and the kitchen stops serving at 11pm. Well it was absolutely no big deal. The server was very attentive and not at all pushy to get us out. She really made us feel great! The signature cocktails here are delicious. Everyone at the table truly enjoyed them. When our food came, everyone was really happy with what they ordered. For the veggies out there, like myself, not so many choices, but I made it work and my food came out good. I really want to come back and try the brunch, looks like a fun place to hangout while the sun is poking through the trees.	1
Super awesome view of DTLA. Eclectic crowd ranging in age from mid 20's to early 40's (me, lol). No stupid attitude patrons, great staff, and not too crowded that you can't move. I've been here on Saturday night a handful of times and have yet to not enjoy. Drinks are typically priced for the area (about $8 to $10 for a mixed drink). Do arrive early unless you like to stand in line for 45 minutes. It happened to me but the doorman and hostess were not snooty or anything like that. Totally professional pair of people. Also, the DJ that night was nice enough to explain her sound system to me while she mixed the tunes. How nice is that? Pros: No cover, the view, easy to get to, good bartenders, chill crowd. Cons: I can't party there as often as I would like :-(	1
Just as good as when I was a kid! Hickory Burger: delicious. Fries: crisp & fresh. Apple pie: can't be beat. Great cup of coffee, with a thick layer of butterfat on the cream. A West L.A. Institution. Not cheap by any means, but a don't-miss stop. And remember: Cash only!	1
I went here for lunch....only to find a fly in my fried chicken.... Disgusting. The lady offered me another chicken, but that one had a fly in it as well... might as well rename it to fly-chicken. Man..good place to eat during Halloween.	0
I LOVED this place. Every dish was very entertaining and creative. The waiters and waitresses were very nice and took care of everything on time. (thanks Alex!) It was a bit pricy, but the food was great! The only problem I had was it was a little too dark inside, which lead me to use my phone flashlight to clearly see the menu. Other than that, it has to be my new favorite place.	1
Ba Xuyen was suggested as a &#34;local&#34; alternative to the new (expensive!) Hanco&#39;s in Park Slope. <br><br>Yes, this is a great place to get banh mi. Cheap ($3.75 for a sandwich, heck yes!) and delicious. Vegetables are appropriately crunchy, the bread thankfully not soggy, and the meat is flavorful. (I could eat the grilled pork all day long.)<br><br>Note that spicy is actually spicy. Those with mild tastes will want to be careful when they ask.<br><br>The staff is friendly, and all you have to do is order sandwiches by the number anyway. Don&#39;t be afraid of the hole-in-the-wall look.<br><br>All in all, is Ba Xuyen worth the hour round trip from Park Slope? If you have free time on a nice weekend afternoon, yes, absolutely. If you&#39;re coming from further? You&#39;d have to be really thrilled by the prospect of cheap eats.	1
I have no idea why this place has 5 stars.. NO CLUE<br>After visiting the LARC my friend and I took a gamble after looking at the 5 star review and we were disappointed to say the least. <br><br>I got the bowl with beef and coconut rice along with some other things while my friend got a tofu bowl. <br><br>The ONLY thing I really liked was the coconut rice which was pretty good.<br>I have no idea what they did to the beef because I found 3 tiny pieces of bone while eating my food. ouch<br>Otherwise, the bowl&#39;s taste was tolerable. However, it just wasn&#39;t worth the price.<br><br>My friend on the other hand hated his bowl after 2 bites and handed it over to me. I couldn&#39;t finish it because of the weird blend of spices in his bowl. <br><br>My friend and I were STARVING since we had not had lunch and starved until 9 P.M <br>We ended up getting some boba instead.	0
As a UCLA alum I had to go here! When entering you get a little confused if you have to sign something for your party or they will approach you. Luckily I was with my bf and he said you have to just be aware of the people who are already waiting and then when someone leaves take their seats. It can get a little bit hectic.<br>Food is delicious! I got the tuna melt and it had a sweet taste, next time I&#39;m going to get the egg sandwich. They serve their sodas in cute little old fashioned cone holders. Make sure you get cheese fries! (Not listed on the menu)	1
A good spot to grab some huge portions of food 24-7, great breakfast and a short walk up Figueroa after a Lakers game. An L.A. icon and it hasn&#39;t closed it&#39;s doors in decades, always open.	1
The food is horribly overpriced for the portion they give you and the quality. On the inside, the place looks badly put together since it used to be a Blue Sky, so all the decorations and the tables look improvised.	0
I used to like this restaurant but stopped eating there after realizing they had a roach problem. One night, my sister and I went there for dinner and alerted the waiter to the fact that a roach was crawling on the wall. The waiter nicely offered to move us to a new table but apologetically informed us that we would have to wait at the bar until a new table became available. We reluctantly agreed to stay but left immediatly after noticing another roach on the counter at the bar. The manager/owner was mortified. We have not been back there since that night.	0
Food was decent at best. The chicken was a bit lukewarm and the curry was alright. i got a weird vibe in there, and the workers weren&#39;t the pinnacle of friendliness. One of them looked over my ticket stub several times, maybe to check if wasn&#39;t stealing that meal; maybe my imagination, I don&#39;t think customers should be treated differently; especially new ones.	0
Stephen, our waiter was great!! Service was prompt and with a smile!! The food was delish!! They offer a wide variety of food.	0
I love how great the atmosphere is. All staff were very friendly. The food was great. You the the perfect view. It&#39;s better when you make reservesations	1
Great costumer service!!!<br><br>1st timer, nice experience.<br>They care for costumer satisfaction.	1
I had my birthday dinner there in November. I signed into The Station Casinos App. It transfer me to Open Table reservations. I put the reservations in for 5:15pm. The service and food was excellent. Will come back again.	1
Haven't been here for about a year, so maybe things have changed.In the running for best cocktails I've had in LA. Sipping on one of their fine drinks whilst perched at an outside table on a cool summer evening is a tough experience to beat. Their food is tasty but not sure it warrants the price tag.Occasional celebrity sightings.	1
$14 for two pieces of over done fried chicken. Place is dirty and service sucks. Don&#39;t bother, better off going to KFC.	0
This place is a welcome addition to the neighborhood. The arugula salad with lentils is delicious.	1
Simply a fantastic bar. The service is top notch as the bartenders (especially Bethany) are all super nice and crazy efficient. We recently hosted a book launch for the hubster's second novel and the staff couldn't have been more helpful. And the kooky thing is the patrons are cool and friendly as well. Before our big party, we came here to test out the food and the space. It's everything we wanted: laid-back, good tap, GREAT FOOD. While we were seated at the bar gorging ourselves in the name of experimentation (we can't feed our favorite people crap so natch, we HAD to try everything out) a couple kindly noted that we hadn't ordered the Mac N Cheese Sandwiches and offered us a sample from their plate. It was seriously the best thing on their menu. What nice people, right?Then, during the day of the event, several staff came up to me to make sure we were doing ok. And even before the event, the patio space we had reserved was being used by another party, whose host came up to me to assure me that they were leaving well before our own shindig started. Who does that kind of courtesy these days? We had an amazing book launch at this very easy-to-love joint. And don't think I won't be back. There are just too many things to enjoy here, from ping pong, to the vibe, and especially the food. I will ALWAYS come back for good food.Thanks, Garage folks, for making my hubby's big night such an effortlessly fun one.	1
Their &#34;Ropa Vieja&#34; is a must try.	1
I have been on a falafel kick and on the quest to find the tastiest ones around town. This is a serious contender. <br><br>I love that it&#39;s a stuffed pocket and not just folded up like a taco and the bread is fresh made. This was how shawarma places I frequented as a kid did it. It&#39;s also awesome how you can pick your toppings! I like that they give you a bottle of tahini for the table since I loveeee tahini and pepper paste. <br><br>The falafel itself was crispy, but still fluffy inside and had good flavor. We are coming back for this for sure. We also tried a shawarma and this was good, but it&#39;s not quite the shawarma I&#39;m looking for. Good spices, but the meat didn&#39;t come from a spit, but pan. <br><br>We also grabbed some pastries. Two baklava, a flowery &#34;macaroon&#34; of sorts, a date cookie. The baklava is money. It was syrupy in a good way. When you bite in it&#39;s moist with syrup, but it&#39;s not overly sweet. Definitely will be getting. The other two were just okay, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d get again. <br><br>Prices were reasonable. Two sandwiches (I think they were $6.50 each), two drinks, 4 pastries was $26. <br><br>Conclusion- Falaf&#39;n tasty! Bak-lovin&#39;! Though there was a few okay items we ordered, those two items were some good eats. We will be back!	1
The pizza. It's serious.	1
OKAY. I finally got to see what the hype was all about. Honestly, there&#39;s a LONG wait but this location isn&#39;t so bad. We probably waited 15 minutes which is really good compared to all the other locations. I tried the shack stack which is the regular burger topped with the mushroom filled cheese. It was WAY too cheesy for me. Burger is good, but not worth the wait or $9. Good enough for me to try once. Besides In-n-out is soooo much better especially when it&#39;s about $2 a burger!	0
very plain food with nothing outstanding, and the service is really bad, actually very rude	0
Never been into the restaurant but we get their food delivered once a month or so and it is consistently good and sometimes stellar. We're always finding new favorites. Would definitely recommend.	1
We were so excited that Boat Street moved close to our condo. Then we stopped by and were underwowed. Food was salty and just okay. Waitstaff was distracted and we sat for about 10 mins before anyone even swung by to get us water.	0
If you're looking for a great meal, based on price point, I'd look somewhere else. I got the 16oz steak and my girlfriend got the lamb. For the money, we were disappointed in the quality of the food. We've had better experiences at Grill 23, Mistral, etc...The service was great and wine list spectacular.	1
We came here for happy hour on a Saturday (4-6) after visiting the tar pits. I&#39;m not sure how to categorize this place..some aspects are that good kind of divey (the hanging plastic drink charms)..some are Italian (the menu and glass grapes hanging from the chandeliers)..a little bit sports bar..a little bit modern (the giant black and white photos with hints of orange everywhere)...it&#39;s a big mashup of things but somehow it works! They have two for one specials on all drinks,starters, petite salads and pizzas. You have to get two items from the same category in order to receive the 2 for 1 deal, but they can be two different items and they discount the cheaper item. This is a great deal for two people on a budget, seeing as one cocktail averages around $13. We started with two cocktails, I ordered the Ginger Fresh and my fiance ordered the Luna-tic. The Ginger Fresh was the perfect balance of tart and tangy ginger flavor and was very refreshing. The Luna-tic was not made correctly and did not taste good, when we told this to the waiter, he was more than willing to make my fiance a new drink, which ended up being the strawberry mojito..much better! After our cocktails, we decided to stick with beer. They have a fun little beer special...a shot of Avion tequila and a tecate in a can for $10...so with the 2 for 1 you can get 2 beers and 2 shots for 10 bucks...not bad! For our appetizers, we ordered the crab cakes and the gnocchi. The crab cakes come in an order of two. They had a nice crust on the outside while staying moist on the inside and the corn salsa and sauce they come with worked well together..nothing out of this world but good. The gnocchi on the other hand was insanely good..I would come back just to get this! We inhaled this melt in your mouth dish...little pillows of flavor swimming in pesto and olive oil topped with wild mushrooms...did I say delicious!?! We continued our feast with two pizzas, the wild mushroom pizza (I needed more after the gnocchi) and the shrimp pizza. The pizzas are a nice size..not the typical LA 4 slice pizza I&#39;ve been seeing everywhere..two pizzas is more than enough for 4-6 people to share. The wild mushroom pizza ended up being our favorite..it was drizzled with a truffle sauce and topped with arugula. The shrimp pizza had a nice spicy kick to it, but my vision of what the shrimp would be like and what came out did not match...especially since everything we had eaten had been so fresh and rustic thus far. The shrimp were just shrimp, nothing special for a $15 dollar pizza...and not sure if they were frozen, fresh or bought from the grocery store. Next time, I&#39;m sticking with anything mushroom from this place. We have had some bad luck lately with trying new happy hour spots in LA, but we left Luna Park with a new happy hour spot in our books when we are in the area. Yes, this meal had its highs and lows, but our service was good and the highs definitely made up for the weaker areas of our meal. Our bill was around $65 for 2 cocktails, 4 beers, 2 shots, 2 appetizers and 2 pizzas...nice! Thanks for a great day date experience Luna Park!	1
Food was terrible, taste like the frying the fish in sea water, taste like they don&#39;t clean the seafood, don&#39;t recommend	0
best breakfast I've had in a while service was great also old fashioned kinda place a+ from here	1
JOOK TIME ALL DAY! Flavorless, horrible service (usually a pro of the experience), and too expensive.	0
The concept is completely based off Chipotle. The food is also incredibly similar (choose your meat in a taco/burrito/bowl) except it costs like $2 more.<br><br>One slight difference is that Ocho has a little bit more variety than Chipotle in terms of meats and toppings. For example, there&#39;s a mahi mahi option and some random purple cabbage (??).<br><br>It surprisingly tasted really FRESH and light. I don&#39;t know what it is but it definitely gave me a fresher, healthier feeling than chipotle does. I split one chicken bowl with my friend and we asked for all the toppings and it was enough for both of us. (I&#39;m a big eater and I even food coma&#39;d a tiny bit afterwards).<br><br>Also, if you check in you get a free chips with guac! I was sad because I didn&#39;t check in until after I paid and was sitting down and I totally missed out... :&#39;( Never again. I&#39;m always checking in the moment I enter any restaurant establishment.<br><br>Overall, I liked it equally as much as Chipotle. They&#39;re similar, but this fresher/healthier taste was actually pretty good. I can&#39;t say better, but good in it&#39;s own way. I still think its a little overpriced being $2 more expensive than Chipotle though.	1
My experience at Local was alright. The people were nice and friendly. However the 2 stars is solely on the food. <br><br>My husband ordered the longaniza sausage with eggs and potatoes. This dish was alright considering some of the potatoes were burnt and you can taste some kind of weird flavor, kinda like when teflon cookware is used and you accidentally leave food cooking there for too long and you get that chemical taste? So maybe it&#39;s from whatever they use to cook with..<br><br>I ordered the whole wheat banana walnut pancakes. The top was burnt and the inside was mushy. The waitress apologized and let me order something else. She was really nice about the whole thing. So I ordered the French Toast with a side of bacon. If you know me I love french toast BUT I wasn&#39;t really a fan of this particular kind. I don&#39;t know what it is but the ends of the french toast were burnt and it had that similar chemical taste that I tasted with the potatoes and I wish I knew what that was. The bacon was alright. It was extra crispy which I can&#39;t really complain about because I like crispy bacon. <br><br>I really wanted to like this place considering all the great reviews. Maybe they were having an off day? When I decide to eat meat again maybe I&#39;ll give this place another chance.	0
After seeing this place on Bizarre Foods (although I don&#39;t know what was so bizzare about this place to begin with), I was itching to try it. I&#39;m a lover of all foods Asian, so I was expecting to be blown away. <br><br>You first get there and see a huge line out the door, so you think, great, this place is gonna be stellar. Then you wait in line for about half an hour before getting to the counter and finding out that it&#39;s cash only. Luckily I had paper on me. I think I would have given this place a one star had I waited for that long and not been able to pay. <br><br>So then I ordered the ox-tail noodles, which in the picture had 5-6 scrumptious looking pieces. When I actually got the dish, it had 2 pieces, with no meat on them! After digging around in the noodles, I found an additional small piece of meat (shocking) and ate it. Now, I&#39;ve had oxtails before, and this did NOT taste like good oxtail. Oxtail is supposed to be gelatinous and soft. This was hard and rubbery. I spit it out. The noodles themselves were great. The flavor, however, was not. I got the spicy noodles, but there was more oil than spice and the flavor was really off. I only gave this place 2 stars cause I couldn&#39;t do one and a half. The only thing about this place that I likes was the consistency of the noodles. <br><br>I also ended up waiting 18 minutes for my food, which was really frustrating, because by the time I had ordered, there were only 2 people in front of me. I didn&#39;t see one dish go out for over 10 minutes in the full-on-view kitchen. <br><br>Maybe it was just my dish that was bad because the other reviews on here are awesome. But am I willing to go back and give it another shot? No thanks. I&#39;ll stick to trying other places where I don&#39;t wait 45 minutes at a to-go restaurant.	0
Well the place is very nice the food is good but the service is pretty slow drinks took 30 min and so the food, the atmosphere and the place is cool but again the service is horrible they need more people or do something about the service really!	0
The Churchill gives you an additional reason to stay at The Orlando. We stayed at The Orlando before Christmas and wanted a quick drink and appy before heading to see family. We enjoyed the margarita pizza and serrano infused margaritas. The pizza was nice and crispy. But, the true highlight is the drinks here. The bartender came out and told us about his method for creating the margarita concoction. It has a nice heat but not overwhelming. I honestly tried to recreate at home. Although I think I got pretty close I am dying to go back and have Churchill's version!	1
I wasn't expecting my nineteen dollar NY steak to be anything special but what they served me, I wouldn't feed my dog.	0
Their sandwiches are very stuffed but it's fun to eat it occasionally and they seem healthier than fast foods	0
Great drinks, great food, great price, great atmosphere! Loved the place, the only down fall was our waitress....she came around at least 5 times to tell us that the patio area is closed at midnight, yet she was no where to be around when we were trying to order another round of drinks!	1
Fav part of my meal was when they overcharged my credit card by $40 and the manager never called me back.	0
Canter&#39;s is great. We used to go there late night after partying many years ago when I lived in Hollywood. I went back recently and had a Pastrami on Rye...you can&#39;t get that kind in very many places. No where in Sf or the greater Bay area and only a handful of place in SoCal...maybe Jerry&#39;s and a few places in NYC and South Florida. Five stars for the memories.<br><br>BTW - There&#39;s a Carl&#39;s Jr. Pastrami Burger commercial running right now that&#39;s shot inside of Canter&#39;s...AND THERE IS NO WAY THAT BURGER COULD EVEN COME CLOSE TO COMPETING... Sorry Carl&#39;s&#39; Jr.	1
I like to go to places many times to get to know them before I rate them on Yelp. I've been to Paper or Plastik a lot of times over the past couple years (since it opened!) and I think it's about time I stop. I'm baffled when I hear people call this a good place to work. The seating is horribly close together, the chairs uncomfortable, barely any outlets if you have computer work to do, and the environment all together doesn't make me want to settle in. The coffee and food are overpriced and overrated, and the vibes from the people are pretty pretentious. There are better coffee joints for me out there. I feel like this is a place I'd only go to anymore as a last resort.	0
good for the "steak and potatoes" crowd. it's basically in and out's cousin.	1
We decided to check this place out with my dad because he wanted Italian but is allergic to dairy. Seeing that this place is noted for their sensitivity to food allergies, we decided to give it a try.<br><br>I was impressed that the waitress asked us immediately if anyone at our table had food allergies. My dad told her he was allergic to dairy and she noted that she would make sure that his dish didn&#39;t have cheese. We ordered an appetizer of the calamari (which my dad ordered for the table) and I am pretty sure it had dairy in it. My dad didn&#39;t each much of it but he also didn&#39;t say anything to us or our server so I am not sure if he noticed or not... or if there even was cheese in it. <br><br>I ordered the chicken, sundried tomato, and broccoli pasta dish. It was alright. I might get it again if we return. <br><br>Our waitress seemed kid of aloof. We were seated outdoors and at one point I asked her where the restrooms were. Dead serious, she said &#34;they&#39;re inside.&#34; I figured as much... &#34;Where inside? Is it to the left? To the right? In the back?&#34; &#34;You&#39;ll see it&#34; First off, it&#39;s in the back, behind an unmarked door (I had to ask another waitress when I went in just to make sure I didn&#39;t accidentally walk into someone&#39;s office or into the kitchen). <br><br>Overall I was pretty underwhelmed with our experience there. I might try it again if I am out with friends or family who have allergies.	0
New menu but food was still very good.  Intimate restaurant.	1
I got the sullungtang, and it was probably the blandest thing I've ever tasted at an Asian restaurant. That was the first time I've had sullungtang anymore so if that's how it's supposed to be...okay. But I've heard a lot about how good sullungtang can be, and this was not it.Service was eh. None of us were Koreans so the language barrier didn't help. The lady dropped the kimchi when she was bringing it over and never brought over a new one :/	0
yum. I got choco twist $3.5 and burekas (mushroom and onion inside pie pastry and no cheese! yay!) $3.25. choco twist has choco chips and vanilla cream inside. They were both delicious. Also cashier girl was super friendly.	1
Where do I begin. Let me just start off by saying that I am giving 2 stars because the sushi rolls were great. <br><br>Anyways, I&#39;m not too picky but I&#39;ll give a detail review in cause anyone finds it helpful. I went on a Friday night around 9PM. Be ready to have your conversations heard. The music was so low that I actually felt uncomfortable talking. I told my husband that I didn&#39;t even feel like having everyone around us listen to our conversations. Our server was super nice and attentive in the beginning, but then he started slacking off. Not sure if he wanted to end his shift early or not. Our drinks came out promptly in the beginning and so did our appetizer (which was pretty decent). My husband ordered a Thai beef dish which he was excited to try. They brought it out cold and without his side dish. 15 minutes later when they came out to bring the my first sushi roll, I asked our server if they can please heat it up for him and bring out his side dish. He was nice about it and then returned promptly with a super hot dish (which I don&#39;t want to assume they microwaved). Another 15 minutes passed and then the other sushi roll was brought out. Needless to say, my husband had only 2 bites of his dish and left it all. He said it tasted so bad that he couldn&#39;t force himself to eat it. We&#39;re not the type to return a dish completely to get a new one, so we just suffered. For dessert my husband ordered his favorite, Thai doughnuts. For years we&#39;ve ordered them from this place and never have they come out how they did that night. We kindly asked for a small ball of ice cream on the side and our server seriously told us that it would be an extra charge which we said was ok. So when the doughnuts came out, instead of the usual dipping sauce in the middle, there was a mountain of ice cream and then to the side a small ball of ice cream. What a disappointment. Over $100 spent on a crappy evening. Will never go back again, even if the sushi rolls were good, it still doesn&#39;t make up for the horrible experience. I rather get overpriced sushi elsewhere.	0
Lovin their new menu and Bloody Mary bar. Such a fun place, bring your friends, lots of room to hang out. The chicken and waffles hits the spot especially during those late night cravings. My go-to bar in WeHo for sure!	1
Liked this place so much after going for lunch today that I decided to stop in again for happy hour. <br><br>The restaurant is absolutely adorable and the setup is very cozy. Also, the dessert and pastry display is extremely tempting. I believe I counted at least 10 different types of macarons, one being guava. I resisted the temptation and decided on a chicken and avocado sandwich on ciabatta. It was very good. The chicken was glazed with balsamic and honey mustard. Great combination of flavors. The menu offers a variety of other sandwiches, salads and quiches. There is also a wine selection and free wine samples as you wait in line, even though it never came my way :(<br><br>After work, I decided to return for their 5-7 happy hour. They have a selection of wine for $5/glass, I had the prosecco. The prices of the snacks seemed fair until the order of quiche came out. Three bite-sized quiche costs a little more than $6. I found that a bit unreasonable, especially since a slice of French bread, meat and cheese costs $5 and it can be shared between two people. <br><br>Also, please be ware that they take closing at 7 seriously. They kept coming to our table every two minutes asking if we were done, and reminding us that it was closing time; however, this isn&#39;t something that will keep me from going back. I understand that when it&#39;s time to clock out, you just want to close up shop and go home.	1
This place has potential!<br><br>The hamachi sashimi feels like fresh fish &amp; green dancing in the mouse.<br><br>The pre-dining bread sticks is one of the BEST in any restaurant.<br><br>The pastry of the cafe is also different and delicious. On par with any boutique donuts shop!<br><br>The crowd is the issue, maybe they need more staff?<br><br>So when u visit PAMM, this is a must. But be prepared for the crowd!	1
Just reviewed the one on La brea. I like this location better.I think it's the vibe of space15twenty, or maybe the fact that I can walk into an Urban outfitters right next door...or the fact that they serve alcohol here....Wait wasn't as excrutiating as the La Brea one either, food tasted just as good with that secret ketchup sauce they got. MmmmOverall, I give these guys a 4. Good food, location is decent minus crap paid parking otherwise I'll be back.	1
A dear friend of mine recommended this bar one night when we were out on the town. Since he is lives in LA and is rather a lush, I thought we would follow his recommendation and thus we headed to it on our recent night out on the town. I would have walked right past the entrance if I had not been following my friend in. Reminded me of that scene in Labyrinth where she pushes her hand against the wall and realizes, well duh there is no wall. Teensy sign does not do it justice. Then again maybe that is why there were only a handful of people there.First impressions upon walking in was that I loved the ambiance. I think I said four or five times that I felt I was in San Francisco or Portland again. Very mellow and non pretentious, nice red walls, non crappy music, bartenders in leather vests, okay bartenders in leather vests is pushing it but they have three different types of Moylans beer on draft there and two Averys, so I&#39;ll let it slide. I was in beer heaven (um later maybe beer hell...lol) ! Thank the lord for Designated Drivers. At 6 to 8 bucks a pop for good craft beers in LA I was not complaining. I would definitely come back.	1
Hickory burger. Yum. Banana Creme Pie. Yum. The old man that served us was super sweet and nice, giving us samples of the sauce and doing little chit chat. When he brought out the banana cream pie, he had a little piece of creme on the side of his mouth. He kept saying how good it was, and I knew he was telling the truth, because he had some! (Not of my pie though.) I hope that guy works there forever! Loved him! U-shaped diner style counter. Similar to In-n-out, I'm assuming because they're both invoking those old time classic diner style. Burgers are small, but I actually like the size. The burgers today are too big! But yes, if you're in the area, check it out. =)	1
Surprisingly good. Accurate with their delivery orders, on par with their pizza pricing, and the food itself isn&#39;t bad at all. The only thing I&#39;d have to comment negatively on is the price, it&#39;s a bit high for sides. Having 5 dollars for breaded mushrooms and most sides is a lot given the relatively small amounts. Still the flavor is there, so if you&#39;re just looking for a pizza go here. I personally recommend the Bianco pizza, or their coupon for two 16 oz pizzas, quite a money saver. I think the delivery cost shouldn&#39;t have been raised like it was, but I suppose that it is the summer months	1
Unfortunately, I have to give a bad review. I was craving some good bar-b-que and my fellow yelpers said this place was great so I headed on over to People&#39;s bar-b-que. The neighborhood was really not that bad. The lima beans were great. Bar-b-que chicken sandwich, not so much. First of all, it has chunks of chicken WITH the bone placed between two slices of white bread, therefore you can&#39;t eat it like a sandwich without needing the Heimlich maneuver. Secondly, I got salmonella food poisoning the next day and for sure it was from there because my sister and I both got sick and that was the only thing we had eaten together. So that&#39;s the story. Stay away from the chicken sandwich.	0
Apple Pan&#39;s Hickory burger is the best damn hamburger in town. It&#39;s a bit pricey, but after having one you can&#39;t help but order a second even if you are full. I love the seasoned waiter who has been there for 50 years. Great burgers!	1
Fantastic west side burger and pie diner joint. $7ish per burger, $2-$3 more for fries, $2-$3 more for drinks. Not cheap but not exhaustingly expensive, either. Burgers were delicious and so heavy I couldn&#39;t finish mine. Fries were fine. Pie was PERFECT. We had a slice of apple and a slice of banana cream pie. I&#39;m gonnna dream about those tonight... <br><br>Anyway, expect simplicity, abruptly quick but not unfriendly service, delicious food that is perhaps priced a couple bucks higher than need be and an overall great dinner. Cash only.	1
Great coffee and bakery, very cool decor, a hidden gem.	1
Stopped in for a quick beer last week with some friends on our way back from dinner, and to my surprise the bartender was beyond excellent, being my first time here I was interested in all the beers. She knew all the little tings and tangs about the various beers, she even game me a mini tasting to I could try, I had a citrusbomb, it was out of this world. Citrus hops, clean crisp finish, made me say wow out loud.	0
I came here because I&#39;m a little over the club scene but I still wanted to be around good music &amp; drinks! Their food I also very tasty! Came in didn&#39;t wait in line PERFECT! Got a table next to a heater EVEN BETTER! Had a blast, good drinks good service &amp; a all a good time with friends:) it was my cousins birthday &amp; they brought ice cream YUM. Everything was very good very classy chill place, music was just right &amp; the view is gorgeous. Def coming back soon! Thanks Perch	1
Dude. These sandwiches are amazing. The menu is creative and diverse.There&#39;s something for everyone on the menu here, and everything is so delish. The chef Mike is always playing around and coming up with new seasonal recipes, and they even do a brunch box now! The people that work there are great, the prices are reasonable, and the late hours are a bonus. Highly recommend!	1
The Umami burger is very delicious the first few bites but after it's ok. I've also tried the Truffle and I can honestly say it was the best burger I've ever had besides inn n out!! I thought the size was perfect, it wasn't enormous and it didn't leave me hungry after. The taste of the Truffle was so different from any other burger I've had and it was so enjoyable! The sweet potato fries were also delicious especially with the dipping sauce they provided. It gets crowded during the weekends but there's this really good art book store to occupy your time next to it and urban outfitters is directly across. I would definitely recommend Umami to anyone and for sure I will be ordering the Truffle the next time I'm there.	1
I tried...with no success. I believe it was partially my fault for patronizing this place on a starving stomach, but I thought that's what you do when you're hungry - go eat! When I got there, the hostess informed me that the wait for a two person table was well over an hour. So I said fine, let's wait it out. I tried to get a drink from the bar, but the bartenders kept passing me by. Specifically, I stood there literaly for almost 10 minutes waiting to get asked if I wanted anything. There were a total of 3 bartenders. One was on the opposite end of the bar, one in the middle area and another one near the middle section wiping the counter and stocking the cups. So I ask the middle bartender for a drink, and she gives me the I'm busy-one-moment-look, which is fine with me (I've worked in the customer service industry many a times to know what it feels like to be swamped with orders). However, she never got back to me. All the while, the wiper/stocker person was standing in front of me and I didn't bother asking for a drink since I thought she wasn't taking orders. So this guy swoops right pass me and orders a drink from wiper/stocker. WTF!!??!?!?! Do you mean I could have ordered from her. I don't understand why she didn't ask me if I wanted something. I mean, I wasn't standing at the bar to get tipsy off of fumes. I thought I was just being curtious for not asking her for a drink since she wasn't a bartender.And in conclusion, the lady friend and I up and left and ate Sushi instead.I wanted to like this place. Instead, I hate this place.	0
This is my new favourite thai place. Forget about Sompun in Silverlake (well don&#39;t forget about it because the ambiance is cuter there), this place has generous portions for the money you pay. <br><br>Also, I am usually not a fan of thai iced tea, but something about their tea makes a thai-iced-tea-hater (yeah, shame on me, I know), actually enjoy and crave it. (CAUTION: it&#39;s VERY sweet)<br><br>I always get their Pad See-ew with chicken and I always have left overs for at least one more meal.<br><br>Also, the waiters are really friendly.<br><br>Parking is usually decent as well, and the restaurant itself is BIG! <br><br>I&#39;ll be back! :)	1
this place is so cute! it makes you feel like your in another town food is a little above average some dishes could use a little more seasoning but it was tolerablei'd definitely come back for the biodynamic wines and appetizers	1
I've been to this restaurant several times, and I really wanted to make it work. It's very close to my bf's apartment, and the food is pretty decent. HOWEVER, the service is horrendous. The first time we went here, the food took at least 45 minutes to arrive, and we were only ordering breakfast. We also waited a long time just to have someone take our order.The last time I was here, we waited for a good 5 minutes to be seated. We ended up leaving because I was starving, and nobody even acknowledged our existence.I think they genuinely just don't care at this place. I've grown too old to tolerate such poor customer service.	0
So we were on an elote missions tonight and got a review from thrillist saying that it had an amazing elote!!! NOT!!!!!!!!! Not the case at all!!! The elote was just roasted but not the real Mexican kind that u get on the street!!!! Everything else looked good in there but didn't try it except the chicharron and that was bad as well!!!	0
Food is good, staff isn't friendly. The only reason my bf and I came here was because ochas had a long line and we didn't want to wait. This place has decent prices but their 7 seas soup is way over priced! Broth is the best part but other than that it's not worth paying $12.50 for it. Ochas sells it for under $8! I only got it because I was sick and wanted a hot soup. The pad thai isn't as good as ochas either. Their eggrolls don't even compare to the eggrolls I get at Pho restaurants. They use the thick wrappers! So that means less crispy and the filling isn't that good! Their house plates are good though. I wouldn't come back unless I'm really craving thai food. This place used to be great. Their service needs to improve. I know I'm not supposed to compare it to ochas but what can I say? Ochas is the spot! And also, $60 for two people? Not really worth it.	0
Just go. There are no words that can describe how delicious...you really just need to get off Yelp and go right now. Best falafel sandwich of my life. I can&#39;t wait to go back and try everything else.	1
FIVE STARS for any place that tastes AUTHENTIC WITHOUT MSG! Had the single serve of seafood stew and the broth was super rich and no msg bloat after - only reason I gotta schedule my Asian feeding time is the dang sugar-salt-msg-bloat that has me feeling like a beached whale for days. BUT I filled up on this joint with every slurpy tasty thing in site and I was a spring chicken after....uh, I think there&#39;s one on the menu actually.<br><br>And it&#39;s super cute - from the apron napkin to the newspaper menu to the damn fine hostess. So it&#39;s super fun. Like drugs with no side effects. Jeez, this why they call it pot?	1
Really enjoyed dinner at florian tonight. Service was warm and friendly as soon as we walked in. We were greeted with a puffy warm cheese bread ball and a tiny chocolate chip cookie which is never a bad thing!<br><br>It was 4 of us and for appetizers we got the vegetable antipasti which was really lovely!! We also got some burrata that was very tasty, a pizza that was super thin crust so it wasn&#39;t too filling and a little salad that was pretty much mixed greens. We were all really happy with our choices and it was great for sharing. <br><br>For entrees I got the veal chop parm which was a huge, delicious portion! The other highlight was the lasagna osso buco. That is definitely a must. The other 2 dishes ordered were pappardelle with eggplant parm and spaghetti carbonara. Both were good but didn&#39;t stand out too much. <br><br>For dessert we splurged on homemade vanilla ice cream which was pretty awesome but probably not worth the $20 price tag. <br><br>Overall really happy with the addition to the neighborhood. Easy to get a reservation, good food, great service and good value. Will definitely be returning.	1
#Cool vibe for the #hipster and #out-of-town crowd. Expensive though. Liked the #ChowMein with shrimp pan-fried HongKong noodle style. KungPao Chicken was average quality. Chicken pieces too large and sauce not the tastiest I've had. #GreatEastern Restaurant in #Chinatown is much better tasting and less expensive.A guy next to me @the bar had an insect in his bourbon on the rocks. Beware***They use the dreaded #MSG in their Cantonese-style dishes. I called the restaurant today to ask as I had the WORST #MSGHangover I've ever had?You have to tell the server #NoMSGI will not go back. So much for an #AnthonyBourdain and #ZAGAT reviewed restaurant. This restaurant has #JumpedTheShark.	0
Not much flavor and heavy foods. The fries are not worth getting only unless you love bland potatoes. Short Rib poutine is not worth getting. It was flavorless, had too much potatoes, and the meat was dry. The steak is definitely worth getting. Considered big plate but only 3 strips of beef. Tender meat with spinach and potatoes. Beet salad is average but warning for those w nut allergies. Overall I think this place is hype. Can&#39;t taste much flavor, dry, insipid entrees. Great place if you love potatoes though; it was in everything.	0
The food at Diablo's was excellent. Our waiter was friendly and helpful. If you don't mind over the top loud restaurants, this is the place to eat!!	1
I was disappointed by this joint. I had ordered the steak burger with cheese and fries and was expecting a good flavor burger but it was nothing special. The fries were stale. I was better off going to In & Out!	0
The fish tacos here are amazing!! The drinks are reasonable too and the front window tables are excellent for people watching. The portions are smaller, which is why most people complain, but if you fine with watching what you eat its fine.	0
The fries are a must! The salads and the chicken are really really good too. And the people are affable and friendly. My brother's practically famous when he comes here.. They all love him!	1
We had the whole menu shared between four people. Standouts for me were the fois gras, the carrot salad, and the duck. It was just really really great. Laid back atmosphere, delicious food, great and reasonably priced wine list. We&#39;ll be back.	1
Dont believe the hype. Music was ok but expected a lot  more. Not sure if we came at the right time as there was not live DJ.  Crowd appeared to be a little older, stuffy, snobish etc.  Not on the same level as STK.  Service was a 10 but food was......OK.  Nothing I really have to go back for.	1
Delicious food, great service, great atmosphere! <br><br>Everything about Ray&#39;s was amazing. First off, the location was perfect. After walking around LACMA, anyone can get tired and hungry. Fortunately, Ray&#39;s is right outside the exhibit. The venue itself was beautiful. You can either sit outside on the patio (which has heated lamps) or inside the restaurant (which has glass walls so anyone can see the outside scenery). My friends and I decided to sit on the patio for the full effect of the atmosphere. All of the tables were in view of the &#34;Urban Light&#34; lampposts, which is an exquisite piece of art in itself. <br><br>The food was very DELICIOUS. My friends had the steak and I had the salmon. I highly recommend both. I have to say, the steak is one of the best I&#39;ve ever tasted. It was cooked medium-rare, and the texture was just right. Unlike most steaks that are dry and tasteless, this one was bursting with flavor. If you love meat, you definitely want to try this steak. The salmon paired with asparagus was also very tasty. For dessert, we had the chocolate cake and sorbet. Both were delicious, but I really enjoyed the chocolate cake. <br><br>As far as service, Ray&#39;s gets an A+ from me. Our server was great. He was very attentive and checked on us often. I had ordered a cocktail that was a little strong for me, but I wasn&#39;t going to make a big deal out of it. Our server noticed I wasn&#39;t drinking the cocktail and insisted on getting me another that wasn&#39;t as strong. He really made a great impression because he cared about customer satisfaction... And the drink he brought back was just right! The general manager, Ron, also checked in to make sure we were having a good time. He really made us feel special because he genuinely cared. All the staff was very personable... We even conversed with another server and had a great conversation about dancing. The staff here was awesome! <br><br>Overall, I had a great time. The food and atmosphere was excellent, but the service really stood out. It was like the cherry on top. I look forward to coming back.	1
Ordered the steak medium. Cut into the steak It was super rare. Sent it back, they returned the same cut steak and it was still super rare. All they did was fire it on high heat and the inside did not even cook. <br><br>The waiter and manager did not even seem to care much	0
One of my friends lives walking distance from Far Bar so we'll grab an occasional beer here. This spot is pretty chill on weekdays, I like that it's not too loud. I don't go on weekends because it gets a lil too crowded (it's not a very big bar and I don't like bars that get packed and crazy). I like the Coedo Beer and the Wasabi fries here :)	1
Great late night spot. Arrive, park, stand in line. Be taken to your table..get waited on by one of the original staff members (now 80 yrs old)--- The roast beef just melts in your mouth..the mashed potatoes are buttered, cloudy goodness. The Rotisserie Chicken is also a winner!	1
place was a total win. Good service by nice people, great coffee, and delicious food, both hot and pastries. Also has a really cool vibe.	1
I&#39;m a red blooded American guy who knows his burgers and fries. <br><br>Miami is severely challenged when it comes to offering good ol&#39; fashioned burger joints, but I can honestly say this place makes great burgers and fries. <br><br>That&#39;s all you need to know. Go there. Get some.	1
Over priced &amp; flavorless<br><br>Maybe I&#39;m not &#34;hippie dippy&#34; enough. The place is small &amp; was very busy. The wait was insane for a grilled sandwich, soup &amp; a green juice. The cream of leek &amp; potato soup was the only thing that had any flavor. Although $3.95 for a small cup is a little much. The pesto grilled sandwich w/chicken was over priced as well &amp; FLAVORLESS. So disappointing. The &#34;be the change&#34; green juice was disgusting. All the spirulina was stuck to the bottom of the cup, the people didn&#39;t even stir it to make sure it blended with juice. $20 bucks and a 15 minute wait for a sandwich, soup that just had to be labeled out of the pot &amp; gross ass juice is NOT something I&#39;ll be going back for. Ever.	0
Brought my boyfriend here for his birthday. Made reservations online and was seated immediately after getting there. The waiter, Tony, was awesome and very attentive.  It was fairly quiet when we got there but definitely got louder before we left due to a few larger groups that arrived. Decor was very nice and there is a small band that plays	1
My husband and I have been eating here for the past few years since it opened and the food is terrific! Each time we go, the service and food is amazing. The truffle fries are fantastic and my burger is always perfect. The UFO dessert is to die for. Every time we go, we have to have it (and I never want to share).	1
Food is so so and staff is rude and slow. Try to find someone to get you your check. Good luck. Then stand by for an attitude.	0
This is a great spot and great addition to the growing downtown bar scene. What was the most remarkable difference for us whenever we pop by perch is the how smoothly we always get our drinks and how great all the staff is - not to mention it's just a generally fun but chill locale. Big ups for perch.	1
A classic LA dining experience. Our server Andy was spot on. Great ambiance. Eating a slice of LA's history.	1
Soup for breakfast, yes please. AMAZING food could do with a little more spice but over all went there 2 days in a row. That means something	1
The smoothies are great when you have biked down there from your house to get them. Plus the pretzels are good to.	1
I had one of the best burgers I have ever had in my life at DLUX. It was called the Sunrise Burger. A Perfectly Cooked Hamburger with a perfectly cooked fried egg, pepperjack cheese,housemade tomato jam, and shoes tring potatoes. Everything in this burger tied together so well. The tomatoe Jam added a touch of sweetness that really set the burger off. They also have a variety of different types of french fries and shakes to go with your meal. Put this place down on your list of places to try.	0
This place is classic LA. I&#39;ve been coming here since I was a kid, and will always come back. Great American diner food, best breakfast in the city. Don&#39;t miss the bacon, thick sliced and crispy, or the French toast made from their signature sourdough.	1
Ordered using the app but it wasn&#39;t ready so they gave me a few freebies. Friendly service. Fresh food. My kids and xwife liked it. Need I say more?	1
Seriously this place is amazing!<br>Me and my friend order several dishes to share and all of them were so good! my favorite was the tostones though -you have to try that... and the cocktails are to die for!<br>I will definitely go back many times more, for sure!	1
I visited the Bistro BE with my partner and some friends we had an outstanding time, service was great, the food was delicious we ordered several different Belgium meals including a vegetarian option, not to mention a huge selection of Belgium beers and wines! This restaurant is defiantly one I&#39;ll be coming back to next time I&#39;m in Miami!	1
Expanded dining room!	1
This place is fun and will be huge national success. I grew up with Arby's and this is what Arby's may once have been. It is perfectly okay for this place to be a higher quality version of Arby's, right down to the sauces. They really need to add coleslaw to the menu and a few more side choice. I will quickly get board of french fries and stop going because of this. This place will be big as long as the partners and investors can remain civil... The RB was slightly dry and overcooked but not horrible. I just know they will work it all out and we can say we ate at the original. Look at the number of reviews in only a few months? Success!Update: Returned several times since and the RB has consistently been moist .	1
First time eating here.....I def enjoyed it! The food and staff were top notch. The overall experience was 5 stars!	1
we ordered salt and pepper crab, honey nut shrimp and fries rice. looked nothing like the pictures on yelp. they were so bad! it was our first time here and I don't understand why this place is so packed. I've been to other crab places and they are way better than this place. this place is over priced and overrated!	0
the line was long, but what do you expect from a popular spot like this. Their french toast and pancakes are amazing and it comes out fast which is awesome because we waited in line for a while. Service was also awesome. I would definitely recommend this place.	1
I had really high hopes for this place after it came up on a best Seattle happy hour search. I went with a friend and we got there right about 5pm. It was hot out, so we sat outdoors on the patio. First of all, the barrel tables are super cute, but the metal stools with no back were super uncomfortable. The waiter brings us lukewarm water in a carafe (no ice) and 1 glass that felt like it just got out of the dishwasher. Mind you, it's 80 degrees out. We asked for an additional glass since there were 2 of us. The second glass never came. The waiter comes over and asked if we would like to get started with drinks. He helped my friend pick out a flight of white wine, and I ordered the rose9 from Spain which he told me after prompting was on happy hour. By the way, if we hadn't looked at the menu before going we would've never known there was happy hour... It's like secret happy hour. He comes out with the flight, and then gives me a glass of white wine. The happy hour white. But, I ordered the pink one :( after awhile he asked if I wanted another glass of wine. Yes please! 10 minutes later, he asked if I wanted another glass of wine..... Yes. Please. The glass I ordered 10 minutes ago... I also ordered food at the same time I ordered the wine, which I had to ask about 20 minutes later (house pickles) which were vegetables. Lastly, our bill came, and he had charged us for an extra glass of wine, which he changed after we asked. All in all, I was pretty disappointed in Bottlehouse. Cute place, I love the idea of it. But, the service wasn't very good. I'm a nice person and usually overlook minor things, but this was not fun, and I got grumpy... No bueno for service, but good wine selection. I'll give them that.	1
(Insert redundant "I'm from New York so I know what good deli is" comment here.)This is the closest thing I've found to an authentic New York style deli in So Cal. The prices are high, but that's also the case at Katz's, which is the best deli in the world. If you want a cheap sandwich, go to Subway.	1
We enjoyed a wonderful dining experience at O'Leary's for Valentine's Day.  The high winds and heavy snow outside were countered by a truly warm atmosphere inside.  Although one of their busier nights, the pacing of the courses was relaxed and very attentive to desires.  O'Leary's offers some excellent choices on their menu.  I enjoyed their Seafood Alfredo, unique in that while the flavors of all the components came through, they weren't washed out by swimming in the Alfredo Sauce.  The proportions were just right.	0
Came by here after a sunday night rehearsal for a few drinks with a medium size group of friends. I do understand it was a sunday evening but it was 11:30 when we walked in and they were quick to tell us we had to order immediately because it was last call. We were the last to arrive so our friends already had their drinks. The un-friendly bartender told us he could only pour us shots since he called last call. I asked for a flavored vodka (clearly displayed on the wall) and he said he couldnt get it for me, my friend asked for patron which he was also denied, so we said just give us whatever... the bartender proceeded to grab silver tequila for my friend form the EXACT shelf the flavor vodka i had requested was on. We went to pay and it was cash only ( now this is my bad i should know better in the city) so i grabbed cash from the ATM .. he took 5 minutes to get back and get my cash which i dont know why because we wasnt serving any drinks. They quickly began flashing lights and making everyone leave before they even finished their drinks. The staff was rude, and unapproachable and I never plan on returning to this bar! ICK	0
I ate here last Friday evening. The waiter was John. There was a sharp piece of hard plastic in my salad, which I found in my mouth. When I informed John, he apologized. He did not offer to comp the salad. I doubt he even told the kitchen about it. I am never going back.	0
I'm on the fence between one star and two.	0
Turkey Burger is killer! Don&#39;t miss it.	1
Agree with the reviews about the decor... really great atmosphere. Pros: large menu, something for everyone? things done in a more French tradition were very enjoyable: fois gras, duck and pork rilette, wine list was decent at good prices - in fact the entire meal was very reasonable in price. Cons: I totally agree with the spotty service, also i got the duck confit and it was dry and tasteless. I ate about 40% hoping it would improve, but had to send it back. It didn't get taken off the bill. My husband got the etouffee, which he ate but he didn't care for it. We've both been to NOLA many times and the cajun food at Toulouse was really not up to par. Our friend got the blackened steak and it just wasn't very tasty. However the desserts were stellar - particularly the bananas foster. Overall, we'll go back, probably for happy hour and give it another chance. Hopefully will improve with time and experience.	0
Giving a low star rating to trulucks as I am a vegetarian and was told their vegetarian dish is very good. On the menu it stated that the grilled tofu was over a bed of vegetable fried rice. I received my dish and it was just a slice of grilled tofu. I mentioned to the server that the menu said that it was supposed to come with vegetable fried rice. He told me that it comes with crab fried rice so he didn&#39;t serve that to me. I was VERY confused and asked if I could get vegetable fried rice extra on the side and he told me they do not make it. I figured a fine dining place would at least make what&#39;s on the menu. My husband had a great time eating stone crab but unfortunately for me I just had a slab of tofu with fries which I could have made better myself. I guess this is what I get for going to a seafood restaurant to for vegetarian food. <br>Please serve what&#39;s on the menu. I was disappointed.<br><br>Aside from that our server was nice.	0
Garlic noodles are amazing. Get the garlic noodles. Pho is a little expensive. I order the #2 raw beef pho. They used to use eye-round steak, which is lean, tasty and pretty inexpensive. The last two occasions I went in however, they had replaced the yummy eye-round steak with real cheap, fatty, chewed up looking meat. Really unhappy about it. I asked the staff about it and they said the owner wants to switch to this. So here I am, letting you know: Do not switch to this meat. I wouldn't feed this to my dogs. It tasted horrible and looked like a total afterthought. Yuck. For a 9 dollar bowl of pho this is the garbage they want to put it in it? No thanks. I'll go elsewhere.	0
My friends and I came here to eat dinner and I wasn't impressed with the ramen or the service here.They just updated their menus, too- so much that when we asked our waiter a few questions about some of the items, he didn't know the answers and initially wasn't willing to find out until my friend asked him to let her know once he does. -_-Anyways, I went with the Tonkatsu Kotteri Ramen and the brother was super thick- it almost seemed like I was eating ramen in gravy. We also asked for an extra portion of noodles but our portion was pretty much the same as the regular. Ramen noodles were average and the amount of meat in each bowl is underwhelming.We also got 2 out of the 4 orders at our table mistaken. Each bowl of ramen was around $9 and I don't think it was worth it- you would have to add quite a few extras to be full.Not a good place for groups larger than 4- each booth could hold a maximum of 5 if you add a chair at the end. Meh is a good word to describe my feelings for coming back here.	0
Took my new bride there before going to see Wicked at the Smith Center.  Food was good, service was lousy!!At the end of the meal it was tough to get the waiter to bring my check.  Once presented with the check I paid with a credit card.  The waiter came back an loudly proclaimed that the card was declined.  Everyone around heard him.  I said that that was not possible.  I gave him another cc and paid the bill.  When he came back I mentioned to him that he did not need to speak so loudly earlier.  He brushed me off, I signed the check.  NO TIP!!t a tip!!!	1
Sis and I had our hearts (and tummies) set on trying Ha Nam Ninh last weekend, only to jump on Yelp and realize they're closed on Sundays! So, in our hangry panic, we called up Namu Gaji to ask how long the wait was, and there was none! So we grabbed a quick cup of coffee and walked over. After much hemming and hawing over the menu, we decided on the kimchi fried rice and the ramyun to share. Rice was good, on par with other ones I've had. Ramyun was okay too, but really nothing special. The egg was cool, but the flavors were pretty similar so we felt like we were just eating a lot of the same thing.Dinner menu is different, and I haven't tried that yet. I wouldn't return for brunch :\	0
Yes, this place has been there forever, has a good burger, and decent pies. But be warned -- it is highly OVER-rated.	0
Idk what's the whole craze about this place came here one evening and it was full . I expected the food to be really good but it was average. The pancakes seemed dry and the egg tasted OK. The bacon was the only thing nice but then again who else doesn't like bacon?!	0
Overall good food and service. We got the breakfast burrito and breakfast sandwich on Stella's cheesy bread with cinnamon hazelnut coffee. The only problem was we went in mid June, and they were not running the ac. It was ridiculously hot in the restaurant which made it hard for us to enjoy our food and the experience.	0
It&#39;s going to be hard eating Peruvian food after experiencing Dr. Limon and I have yet to find a place that compares. Sadly this place did not live up to my expectations. <br><br>The occasion: parent&#39;s anniversary dinner<br>The setting: this restaurant who&#39;s decor is great and the way they serve dishes is pleasing to the eye but that&#39;s where it ends<br>The dishes: Beef Chaufa, Jalea Mixta and a fish dish whose name I cannot recall<br>The verdict: The Chaufa&#39;s rice was way too hard and I understand that there is going to be a certain level of grease for the Chaufa but this was too much. The Jalea Mixta looked huge but they only provide a certain number of each item (2 Mussels, 3 shrimps etc.) and they make it look huge piling on the onion salad on top. Not impressed. The fish was the only thing that was deemed worth it. <br><br>I won&#39;t be coming here again even if the service was good. It&#39;s a shame. Maybe it&#39;s because we came too late and close to closing time? But that should never be an excuse for the mediocre food experience.	0
Oh my god, this place is so cute. I love the atmosphere, the vibe, everything about it for the most part. I thought it was also very cool to watch them make other people&#39;s food while standing in the line. Cute, affordable, and great quality.<br><br>Parking is tricky. You better tune on your parallel parking skills or be just in luck since you can hardly find parking. Especially on the &#34;business weekend&#34; (i.e. Friday-Sunday). Parking is extremely cheap, so no complaint there. Meters are free on Sundays too. <br><br>My only negative with this place is the location is so incredibly tiny. The door is a &#34;single-person-door&#34;, and it&#39;s maybe 50 sq/ft entirely to the public&#39;s use. When I went, there was literally around 15-25 people and it was extremely crammed. So ladies and gentlemen, please keep your purses, wallets, phones, or anything of value close and within your eyes. Very easy for pick-pocketing among others. <br><br>Food was incredible. I did have a borderline stroke by the end of the experience practically yelling at everyone in my car to not hit my parked vehicle. Way too many people entering and exiting vehicles next to yours at all times. If you drive a rather above-average vehicle that&#39;s worth some bank, I would advise to pay for private parking, or park father away in a less-traveled parking lot.<br><br>Will be back very soon!	1
The waiter tells us the scallop dish comes with three large scallops for $19.<br><br>We order it. <br><br>It comes with two average sized scallops.<br><br>Waiter goes to ask the chef.<br><br>Chef says &#34;It&#39;s based on weight&#34;<br><br>Hmmm... then why did the waiter say it comes with three large scallops?<br><br>Waiter should have made it right.<br><br>I wanted my scallop. I wanted this to be a good review.	0
Best Mexican breakfast in Seattle!!	1
My husband and I went here today, on a Saturday. We&#39;ve passed this place several times and always said we&#39;d eat here. If it wasn&#39;t for the need to go to Lowes, we would have missed out on how great this place is! <br><br>It was around 2:30ish so we must have just missed the lunch crowd. As we were looking over the menu, I know I was constantly changing my mind of what I wanted. Then I saw the bratwurst and my mind was made up. Same for my husband. In fact, we decided to order two of the #3 (brat, drink, and fries). I ordered my brat with K-up, mustard, cheese, and onions (Yum!); the fries the crinklely ones and my husband ordered his with the spicy mustard only; the fries traditional.<br><br>We were not disappointed with our food at all. In fact, we both wanted another despite already been stuffed. A couple for the road maybe? As others have mentioned in their reviews, these dogs do have a &#34;snap&#34; to them when you take that first bite. It&#39;s the way a dog or a brat should be. All dogs and fries are made fresh when ordered, which you can tell. The refills on your drinks are free and automatically served in those take-out cups so you can fill up before heading out the door. <br><br>Even though we both got the brats, we will definitely go back (Lowes stop or not) and try their other dogs. The space is kind of small but I think it addes to the atmosphere and there&#39;s counter sitting as well. This restaurant also had a warm, friendly feeling to it. I also get the feeling it&#39;s family run which is great to see. We highly recommend Uncle Al&#39;s!	1
I was in the mood for soup. Since the roommate had a 30% off code for , I decided to order from Genki.Croquettes (2 pcs) - deep fried potato cakes served with deep fried sauce ($4.95)The roommate's pick. He liked it dipped in the tonkatsu sauce.Chicken karaage - chicken nuggets ($4.95)Good. The outside was nicely fried and crispy.Gyoza (5 pcs) - pan fried pork dumplings ($5)Okay. Kinda oily and all the dumplings stuck together.Beef & enoki roll: shredded kimchi and enoki mushroom wrapped in sliced beef, seasoned with spicy miso sauce ($7.50)I think there was too much sauce and it was too one note. I love enoki mushrooms and beef, but the tastes and texture were just mushy.Chashu ramen: house made boiled pork served with half boiled egg, bamboo shoot, green onion and red ginger in tonkotsu base ($9.95) +Boiled spinach ($1.75) +Spicy miso (+$1)They forgot my spicy miso! Arg! This is the second time this has happened so I was annoyed. It was only $1 and if they had come by again with the miso, it would have been too late. The broth is very light, both in consistency and flavor. I was expecting it to be richer. Chashu and toppings were okay. Some slices of the chashu were a little dry. I did like the boiled spinach though.Ox tongue robatayaki: with salt ($2.75)Pork neck: with soy sauce ($2.95)Ika yaki robatayaki: giant squid with soy sauce ($8.50)Chicken gizzard: seasoned with salt ($2.50)Shishito: japanese green pepper with salt ($2.50)All the robatayaki skewers were pretty good. The squid was a little too sweet for my liking. And the gizzard was super rubbery.Curry tonkatsu rice - deep fried pork chop with curry sauce ($8.95)The roommate's. I wish they put the curry on the side so the tonkatsu breading wouldn't get soggy en route during delivery. Chahan rice - fried rice with chashu ($9.25)I didn't like this at all. It had a nutty flavor. Almost like there were peanuts in there. Maybe it was some kind of nut oil? Anyways, the roommate liked it. Since I'm not a huge fan of nuts, I didn't care for this dish.In all, I would give the food 3 stars. But -1 star for forgetting my spicy miso again! What a waste of a $1!	0
I&#39;m not sure why this place has so many great reviews. The food was edible. That&#39;s about it. Nothing stood out. Personally, I think I could get a more authentic fish taco at Rubio&#39;s and a better tasting carnitas burrito at Chipotle--and at 1/2 the price. There wasn&#39;t enough flavor or spice or anything, really. Was asked what kind of salsa do I want? Um, I don&#39;t know, how about all of them? How do I know which one is best if I can&#39;t try them all? Total turn off. My burrito was dry and I didn&#39;t like having to beg for more soda. For God&#39;s sake invest in a salsa bar &amp; let people get their own soda! One more tip: don&#39;t run out of utensils. Especially when customers don&#39;t appear to be lining up. When business is that slow, you shouldn&#39;t really run out of anything or make your guests wait while you restock the forks.	0
I am obsessed with this place! It has the best burgers ever! and they have the best pink sauce as well. Food is served fast i always order to go. I wish moez was open till later times i would go eat there everyday lol and you have to try the fried Oreos! YUMM! :)	1
It's one of the few places I enjoy outdoor seating: a nice combination of sun, shade, and breeze.Food wise, our selections have always been excellent. The stuffed french toast w/ banana and pecans is moderately sweet and not too heavy. I remember the Eggs Florentine and the Oscar were enjoyable egg dishes. It's nice to order a couple and share amongst your friends. A nice combination of sweet and savory breakfast/brunch items.The portions here are definitely shareable if you're a girl. Not a cheap restaurant, but it's a treat whenever I get to eat here. It's part of experiencing LA!	1
This is my go to place for Middle Eastern food, at least once a week. I am always welcomed with a smile, the food is consistently good and very inexpensive. The kibbeh platter with two kibbehs two sides is the best. The dining room shares the same space with the supermarket and bakery, and this place has been around forever with hardly any remodels, so expect a casual, authentic albeit rough environment.	1
Recently 3 of us had drinks, dinner, and desert at Hecho. We loved the space and thought it was really well-decorated. The margaritas, and tequila-based cocktails were good. Sadly, for a restaurant in a city full of authentic Mexican food and increasingly, higher end Mexican, we all found the food to be mediocre at best. Between us we tasted the albondigas appetizer (good size and tasty but nothing special) and 6 types of tacos - with no standouts at all. Coffee is French press but there is no decaf served (huh?). There are only 2 deserts on the menu: ever so trendy donut holes and a dark Mexican chocolate pot de creme that while acceptable, did not taste as though it was made from either dark, or Mexican chocolate. There's a lively bar scene here and (for us) excessively loud music so perhaps the idea is to cater to 20-30 somethings. If your tastes are more sophisticated, skip this place and head to Nopalito or Copito in Sausalito when you want Mexican food and atmosphere.	0
Service was kinda slow but the food was good.	1
We had to wait 35 minutes for a table at La Isla on a Saturday night which isn't unreasonable and a couple of mojitos at the bar helped with the wait. When my entree arrived my initial reaction was to be underwhelmed. The food at La Isla isn't attractive in my opinion. I had brown mushy pork with brown mushy rice with brown mushy beans. 	1
Sometimes you need a hot and comforting bowl of soup to sooth your soul. The basic bowl runs you a mere $5.99! There are many other choices, too but I just went with the basic beef soup that my friend introduced me too many years ago. Comes with purple rice and kim chi. Service is fast and efficient. If you understand Korean, you may have an edge here as signs are posted without English translation. Although I am not Korean/don&#39;t speak Korean, I was greeted/spoken to in the language but had no problem ordering as I pointed to the item I wanted to order. Tables are not too close together and there are flat screens all around. Parking is in the back or one can deal w/ metered parking in front. I like this place once in awhile and maybe will get the nerve to try something different the next time I go!	1
An old friend invited me here on Friday night, and I&#39;d always wanted to check the place out! I parked in the $6 lot across the street, which is a great deal for DTLA. Plus, I got to park my own car. I really don&#39;t like valet. <br><br>There was a long line to get in at around 11, and a shorter line for downtown locals (although I&#39;m not sure how you prove that.... just about everyone I know has an address on their ID that&#39;s different from where they actually live). It moved fairly quickly and I took an elevator up to the 13th floor, then one to the 15th. No cover charge, what what!<br><br>Perch is one of the most beautiful spaces in the city. I never understood why LA doesn&#39;t have more rooftop bars; in SD they seem to be everywhere. Perch consists of the top 2 floors of the building. Incredible views of the city, fire pits, comfortable cushioned benches, potted trees with lights.... I loved it all. Although there are heat lamps, ladies may want to bring sweaters anyway because they&#39;re a little spread out. <br><br>It&#39;s a diverse crowd, which also goes for attire. My friend told me to wear &#34;club clothes,&#34; but I saw everything from jeans to ho dresses. I chatted with a lot of new people and saw people on dates, people who came to pick up on girls, people in groups of friends.... it&#39;s just a great place for anyone. I could see myself coming here often if I lived downtown. The ONLY reason I&#39;m knocking a star off is because of the expensive drinks and the lines.... one to get in the building, and one to get from the 15th to the 16th floor, when the 16th floor obviously had plenty of space, and no reason for a line. <br><br>There are 2 bars on the lower floor and 1 on the upper, which is nice. Drinks are around $14 each, but this is downtown. I tasted my friend&#39;s Moscow Mule variation, which was smooth and delicious. We both agreed it tasted a little like lychee but less sweet, and was also very deceiving. I asked for a Long Island (my usual) but was told they didn&#39;t have any, which was weird considering it was a full bar.<br><br>Me: &#34;So since you don&#39;t have those, do you offer something that&#39;s equally strong and equally delicious?&#34; (It had been a long, rough, day, don&#39;t judge me).<br>Bartender with an awesome mustache: &#34;I can make ANYTHING strong.&#34;<br>Me: &#34;Anything, is that right?&#34;<br>Bartender: &#34;Of course. Try me.&#34; Hands me the menu.<br><br>I picked Perch&#39;s variation of a Manhattan, and sipped it the rest of the night. One drink. Fast forward to closing time, and I ended up sitting in my car alone after the bar closed, singing, and sending text messages I shouldn&#39;t send, until I could drive home. <br><br>Lesson learned: do not challenge a bartender. You will lose.	1
I really wish i felt differently about chipotle, but i dont. I really dont like the food here so i dont know what the hype is all about..	0
After a great first experience as part of a large birthday group, I was sorely disappointed at a subsequent Sunday brunch---to the point where I walked out, something I&#39;d never done before.<br><br>Our server was pleasant but ineffective. After getting our drink order, he never returned (until we finally flagged him down 15 minutes later) to 1) get our food order, or 2) deliver our drinks!<br><br>I went up to the host/manager and politely mentioned that our server seemed to be swamped so could we please have someone else help us. He didn&#39;t do anything.<br><br>The fourth and last member of our party ordered a drink and got it quickly, but the staff member who came didn&#39;t have the rest of the group&#39;s drinks. We mentioned this to him but he never returned.<br><br>Almost half an hour later, the rest of our table finally got our drink order. But we had to ask again for our waters. All of us were getting really annoyed at this point by the lack of service.<br><br>At about 40 minutes with no appetizers or main course, another member of my group went up to talk with a different host/manager.<br><br>No change. Our server finally came by to say that there was an issue in the kitchen and offered a weak &#34;sorry&#34; about the wait. He asked us if we wanted more drinks. Really? Not offering to comp it to make up for our inconvenience, we decided to leave well enough alone rather than risk another 20 minute wait for more alcohol.<br><br>At the hour mark, seeing parties who were seated after us receiving their food and drinks, I got up and walked out. The rest of my party toughed it out, brave souls.<br><br>So in the space of an hour, we politely talked to 4 different staff members to try to get our food and drinks in a timely manner, but there was no change in performance and barely an apology of any sort (once from our server).<br><br>All we got were drinks... served about 20 minutes to a half hour after ordering them 2 minutes after being seated.<br><br>I&#39;ll never go here again.	0
Visited this establishment recently with a group of friends. Basically came here to drink so the stars above are only indications for the beverages/atmosphere. This is a pretty chill place and the beers on tap are great. Plenty of Belgian beers to choose from and my friends had more than enough whiskey as well. The place is mellow, but has a real cool vibe to it. Glad I found this place, I will be back, with more friends in tow.	1
I like Canter&#39;s Deli! The bakery gets me every time; lots of yummy things! It&#39;s a quality Jewish deli, with tons of selection. Sometimes I come here for breakfast, but typically their pastrami sandwich for lunch &amp; their garlic pickles are the reason I make the trip. <br><br>Not too far from the LACMA or the Grove if you&#39;re sightseeing!<br><br>The interior of the building is very old. I often find myself staring up at the ceiling - fall foliage with the sunlight coming through... The demeanor of the employees is often grumpy, but I like it, for some reason it to fits the place. Parking is in a lot right next to the place, which with validation is free!	1
If your hungry this is not the place to eat. When I went the food took forever! I understand its made to order but geeez, forever. I ordered a chicken sandwich something, and it was nothing special, coffee was cold, twice I asked for hotter coffee until finally they brought the mouth burning coffee out, lol. I will skip this place in the future. oh the calamari salad was ok	0
My favorite burger place in Los Angeles. Just a few steps down from my gramps house, I&#39;ve had an opportunity to visit these guys quite a lot over the years. Their burgers are substantial with real cheese, the atmosphere is fun (sit at the counter- watch &amp; learn), and their apple pie is heavenly. So heavenly, in fact, that my gramps and his lady friend eat a slice for breakfast every morning (you can buy whole pies to take home). She just turned 80, and he&#39;s pushing it, and they &#39;re both pretty particular (you don&#39;t want to waste a meal at their age), I&#39;d say that&#39;s the best endorsement.	1
A good place to have a get together or a bday party.<br><br>Food is whatever&#39;s. Tried to shrimp and grits, pork belly, bibb and bleu salad. Overall, food is salty and overpriced. You&#39;re pretty much eating here only in order to reserve a table for later on the night.<br><br>Asides from the food, it&#39;s a great place to have a couple of drinks. Classy with a great view of downtown.	1
The atmosphere was excellent and the customer service was off the chain. I enjoyed the &quot;unadvertised&quot; menu items and prices.	1
I don't know if I haven't drank enough of the Tom Douglas koolaid yet or what. I went to Palace Kitchen Monday night and loved it. This place was recommended to me by several Seattle coworkers, even one from New York. It was not all it was cracked up to be. I walked in, it was just me and the restaurant was pretty crowded so I thought maybe I'd just get it to go. The hostess walked past me probably 5 times without saying anything and then helped another guy came in behind me. On the 6th time I finally asked her if I could order to go from her. She didn't apologize for blowing me off the first 5 times but said she could help me. I ordered a fennel sausage pizza and walked it back to the hotel, waiting to have some life changing pizza moment. It was...meh... The sausage on top was really good, although I'm not sure I understand leaving in the little balls, makes it hard to eat. The cheese was cheese, there was an average amount of it. The crust was the highlight, it was a little crispy, a little chewy, pretty good. The sauce was the lowlight, really salty, other than that, not many spices or anything. Overall, I'm glad my company has to foot the $18 bill and not me.	1
Food was bad and cold service was slow and it wasn&#39;t even busy. Won&#39;t be there anytime soon. Hopefully if and when I come back it will be better.	0
Decided to try this new restaurant to celebrate my boyfriend&#39;s new job! I love Eastern European food and this hit the spot! I had the beer stroganoff and my boyfriend had the garlic shrimp. We also had the hummus with ground beef and it was delicious! Definitely a must try when you come here. Just a heads up, the restaurant has a very relaxed European feel. The service does take a little longer than most but the food is worth the wait! Plus, the waiters are really nice and check in to make sure everything&#39;s ok. We&#39;ll be back with friends next time!	1
Low quality ingredients prepared in a mediocre way. The prices are fairly high for what you get, although at least portions are fairly large. <br><br>But $11 for a bacon and cheese omelet that turns out to be Kraft singles and a few burnt pieces of bacon, with a thin egg layer? No thank you. <br><br>Service is pretty apathetic too. <br><br>I won&#39;t be back.	0
Don't know how the food is	0
Such a great place. The view, the drinks and most definitely the gate keepers that give you entry to the wonderful place that is the perch. :)<br><br>An iconic landmark for the DTLA bar scene.	1
Hi, I just ate here for the first time. I found a new restaurant with a lot of bugs to iron out.	0
Good service good food the steak was perfectly medium rare prepared just the way I ordered it. Too many fries they are good but it looks like it comes with every dish. The parsnip and celery soup was delicious. For dessert passion fruit sorbet was delicious.	1
I had Jury Duty and walked over to check this place out and I really enjoyed it. I wanted to make the best out of my Jury Duty so I spent a lot of time trying to find where I would go for lunch. Panorama cafe has a wonderful view of the skyline, however don&#39;t get me wrong the food is very much reminds me of a cafeteria style cafe but I didn&#39;t mind that at all. If you&#39;re looking for really authentic food this is not the place for you, however if you want to escape life for an hour and enjoy a magnificent view for lunch while on Jury Duty it is worth it! Just get there right away because lunch time is busy at Panorama because everyone goes there.	1
I hate places that are packed with tourists (bring your patience!) but the a la swisse and its little tasty brethren make the trip worth it.	1
Worst service ever! My friends and I ordered and waited more than half an hour to get our food. Ppl who came in late got food even earlier than us. My friend wanted hot tea and steamed rice, the waitress heard but didn't give her. When we left $1 for tip and ready to leave, that waitress said "is this the tips?Yours!" and then THREW the bill HARD to us! Really horrible and rude waitress. Will never go to this place again.	0
My boyfriend took me here last night for my birthday. I had never heard of it and don't live in the area, but was excited to try something new. The decor had a gothic feel and was dimly lit with candles on the tables. We were seated at a booth which was cozy and intimate. We ordered:- strawberry mojito was good and they put a little mermaid figure on the cup that I kept. so cute!- goat cheese fondue (came with little pieces of bread and apple slices). I am a huge goat cheese lover but would say this dish was just ok. - artichoke was YUMMY! So good! Wish I could make artichoke this good.- mushroom pizza was really good. Assortment of mushrooms were good good good!As we were finishing our dinner the waiter came out with a tray of desserts asking if we wanted any. I didn't, even though it was my birthday. We just asked for the check and I went to the bathroom. As I get back to our table our waiter came out with a huge cake, with candles and sparklers. The whole restaurant sang "Happy Birthday" and then I blew out my candles. The waiter lifted the huge cake to reveal a cute little cheese cake underneath! So awesome and the cheesecake was good!Would definitely recommend this place for birthdays, dinners, lunches, groups!! They have valet parking for $5, but street parking was super easy to find.	1
Same owner as Park's and the former location of Don Dae Gam. All you can eat setup, which normally isn't my jam but somehow works here. Banchan on par with Park's, maybe a slight notch below but FAR better than most KBBQ places. Bruce was our server and he is a great guy, super upbeat and down to keep supplies coming to our table. Yes, I'm saddened by the loss of DDG, but I find comfort in knowing that King is actually a good experience. Will be back.Oh and on one side of the restaurant, they keep Gangnam Style upbeat Korean rap music going on, which somehow feeds the tempo of your meal.	1
The layout, as other reviewers have mentioned, is indeed strange, but the food itself is great. Glad to see finally see some Philippine cuisine here in K-town, though the prices are on the high side for some wieners. There isn&#39;t much to say about service since there&#39;s only one guy to take your order at the front and you pick up your order from the cook on the other side of the restaurant. Regardless, +3 for the food and +1 for the service (and mostly because there isn&#39;t enough Filipino in Koreatown).	1
I think it&#39;s worth mentioning that this is a 5 star restaurant independent of the good cause it supports. Great good, great value, great service, cool space, and BYOB = a winning restaurant, no matter whether it&#39;s a for profit enterprise or a community minded organization such as this one. Check this place out.	1
As a West Village resident for almost a decade, one of the main reasons why I stay in the neighborhood (besides the quiet cobblestone tree covered streets) is the food. There are SO MANY GOOD restaurants in the West Village.<br><br>However, through the years, as rents have increased and a lot of the smaller casual restaurants have been forced out, the ability to grab something delicious and quick has dwindled. <br><br>Enter: Otto&#39;s Tacos.<br><br>I&#39;ve been a huge fan (and good friend of, supporter of, collaborator with and advocate of) their food since they opened in the East Village last year, so I am thrilled to have them come to my neighborhood.<br><br>FULL DISCLOSURE: I am totally biased, they are family. But the bias comes from a good place. I wouldn&#39;t eat the food of my best friend, mother, brother or sister if I didn&#39;t like it. Maybe my father. And I definitely wouldn&#39;t advocate for it, support it and promote it if I didn&#39;t love it.<br><br>Otto&#39;s food is fresh, simple and packed with bold flavors. My favorites are the shrimp, mushroom, carne asada and their now infamous deep-friend taco - the Gorgon. Wash it all down with a delicious (and affordable) beer and their perfectly crunchy Masa Fries (yup, tortilla + french fries had a baby and that baby is delicious).<br><br>I highly recommend coming in for a taco or five. The West Village casual dining scene is a much better place with these guys (and Mighty Quinn&#39;s just around the corner! Amazing!) now in it.<br><br>I guarantee if you live in 10014, this is your new go-to.	1
Not sure if Im coming back to this location...i love Shortys but between the dry and cold chicken the service was the worse.<br>All young kids working and looks like no manager at least at 4pm until 5pm when I left.	0
Great pizza.	1
Horrible service! Was very excited to try this place for happy hour and it turned out to be a bust. Not very busy when we walked in on Thursday. We sat down and were not greeted or served ever! After ten minutes of waiting to acknowledged we finally took our business elsewhere. also, the bartender was rude and yelling at a man at the bar. Not sure if it was her bf but couldn't help but hear how unfriendly she was.	0
Dekalb Restaurant is a neighbourhood gem that hits all the right notes: great community spirit, lovely refurbished atmosphere, an incredibly friendly staff who all take the time to get to know you, and amazing food. In an era which is increasingly hands-off, it&#39;s nice to know that there&#39;s still pockets of community like this restaurant.<br><br>We&#39;ve been here for both dinner and brunch, and both times the food has been supremely outstanding. Dekalb specializes in the veg options, though there are still options for us meat-eaters (oh, how the tables have turned!). Prices are low, and though the portions are reflective of the cost, they&#39;re not absurdly Lilliputian like it can be in Manhattan. The best part, especially for someone that doesn&#39;t drink all that much, is that they have creative non-boozy -- the Bluestone (their take on a virgin Bloody Mary) is damned good for brunch, while the Brozost (lemon, thyme, and sparkling water) is a bubbly treat you need to have asap.<br><br>As I&#39;ve mentioned before, service is incredibly friendly. They are very much aware of the ingredients in their dishes, which is great since one of us does come with a strange food allergy. Don&#39;t expect to be rushed into decisions or eating by the service -- Dekalb lets you linger from beginning to end, all with smiles and thanks at the end of the meal. It&#39;s no wonder we&#39;re very excited that this place is only a few blocks away for dinner and weekend brunch, and I expect it&#39;ll be one of our neighbourhood staples shortly.	1
I was super excited to try the place out for delivery. Well when I called I was told to hold but I wasn&#39;t actually put on hold. I could hear the employees in the back laughing and talking and the guy who put me on hold was apart of the conversation which had nothing to do with food or work. Finally after 5 min of listening to this he asked me what my address was and as I started to give it to him he cut me off and said they don&#39;t deliver to my location. He said they deliver to sw 117 ave to sw 167 ave.... I live off of 115 ave. It&#39;s not like I&#39;m 10 avenues away from 117!! Give me a break. Terrible customer service!	0
I dined here with 4 other people recently. The food was spectacular, the drinks were on point, the ambience was great. The service was a little off from the beginning- as someone who has worked in the industry for 15 years, I know I can be a little picky. However, it was evident that I was not being too critical when our server left after dropping dessert menus- not saying she was leaving, another server not stepping in until we asked. We were one of two tables left in the restaurant at this point. We asked to split the check and the server said he couldn&#39;t do that, so we marked the tab with who had what, and the server said he couldn&#39;t do that because of some sales tax malarkey- basically it came down to our table paying for a lovely dinner with us calculating everything at the end with no explanation of why we were supposed to sit and split our check up when we just spent over $500 to eat out. I would recommend this place to anyone who wants to eat a great meal and have great drinks. I hope they work on their customer service a bit however.	0
Restaurant is in great location if attending a trade show at Mandalay Bay. Cadillac margarita excellent at $14. Food was tasty, but that typical prepared in advance fare and therefore cold. Another indication of this was the speed with which the food arrived; which was quickly. Therefore, although food was cold I am giving a better recommendation as the location was conducive to a produtive lunch meeting.	1
Perch was good back in the day. It was more open and the crowd was younger.Fast forward and you've got a consistently "overcapacity" bar with a level of pretentiousness that is downright disrespectful.When you get through that ridiculous line in the front (we show up consistently before 9PM on busy nights), you'll be lead to a second line to get into the second elevator. Yes - this is not a simple process.Once you're up there, you'll be herded like cattle out of the area. The bouncers are so damn rude. We had literally gotten out of the elevator and he turned to us and said "you guys need to move out of the way. we are overcapacity and we WILL remove you."WHAT THE F*? Who says that to their guests?We then attempted to wait in line for the third elevator (yes third one) where they make this fake little queue to build hype about their true rooftop bar. By golly it is ridiculous because after waiting half an hour in line - there were maybe 20-30 people up there. This is of course, after being herded again by another bouncer saying we couldn't stand in line because we were blocking it.By the time we were up top, we had given up. Tired of the b.s. and just headed back out.If this was a one time experience, I would have let it be. But after 3 times of being here, I just can't do it more. Stay away from this pretentious bar that only talks the talk and wears the makeup, but doesn't walk the walk and is downright ugly without the faux-midcentury look.	0
new to Korean food so it was great that the menu was simple and easy to order. Both dishes we tried were great and had good service as well.	1
We didn't even know this restaurant was nearby but saw it on the map and read the reviews. The food was outstanding and the wine choices were excellent. I definitely recommend the grilled Brie!	0
Great addition to the neighborhood. Wonderful (homemade) soup & quiche specials every day, tasty salads, and hearty sandwiches. The space is well done and it's also a breeze to get take-out. I get lunch from Manna at least once/week. My only complaint? Sometimes their portions are a bit stingy but maybe I'm just being greedy!	0
My trip to Lola was pretty limited - I went with two gal pals for brunch on a Sunday and ordered the doughnuts. The doughnuts were tasty, though I felt like for the price I paid I should have had more. However, the service was very good and I'd probably give Lola a second glance if I was looking for a good Greek lunch or dinner spot, even though I wouldn't recommend it for brunch.	0
Love it! I eat here atleast once a week. <br>If you can appreciate a good steak, you&#39;ll be thrilled to eat here. The cuban flare is the perfect touch to this Argentinian grill. The staff is beyond helpful and always willing to recommend off the menu specials.<br>The Churrasco is always cooked as I order it and its evident that the cut is fresh and never frozen. <br>Strongly recommend.	1
This was my first time checking out an Australian place. <br><br>There&#39;s kangaroo on the menu for the adventurous types. I went for the safer route and got lamb lollies on a bed of rice. The lamb was a little fatty in some places, which left a very little bit left to eat (the lollies are pretty small).<br><br>The beer list was decent. Not amazing, but not terrible. <br><br>The service was fantastic, and all of the staff was welcoming and seemed like a nice bunch of folks. <br><br>Aussie food probably just isn&#39;t my style, I guess.	0
This should be on your foodie destination map if you&#39;re visiting NYC. Take a trip to red hook and drink (savor) it all in. Erin, the owner, is awesome as well. She gave us recs, but honestly I can&#39;t imagine getting an only okay plate of food here. It&#39;s all outstanding.	1
I went to perch for having drink with some friends. It was a wonderful experience specially for my friend who was visiting downtown LA for first time. The view is spectacular, appetizers are delicious. Unfortunately we didn't have time to try food.	1
Have you ever been to Sol Food in Marin? That place is awesome. This place is not Sol Food even though it seems like they have almost the same menu. It's either too bland too sweet or just generally mediocre :(	0
Great views, lounging pool and a full bar. We are staying at the Wilshire hotel and couldn&#39;t wait to check out the Roof. Our first experience was for breakfast and we had a great experience with the staff and some very good steel cut oatmeal. Later that day we decided to come back to end out work day. The wifi worked great and it was a great place to relax and finish up those last emails of the day. We stayed at the hotel for 3 nights and we made it up the the roof multiple times and loved it. Its a great place to hang out for breakfast or lunch.	1
We missed it completely the first time we drove past - very easy to miss in this strip mall.<br><br>However, once we stopped, we had a great time. The host and waiter were both very attentive. Service overall was really pretty good. <br><br>I had the Pad See Ew, and my husband had the Pad Thai. Both dishes were cooked to almost perfection. I wanted to save some for leftovers but ended up eating too much. Very yummy.<br><br>The desserts are all fried so I was a little turned off, but they later sent over a tapioca/coconut dessert on the house which was delish. <br><br>Great service and good food, with a nice dine-in ambiance and good take-out service. Overall, a winner!	1
We enjoyed our dinner, and the ambiance of the restaurant. The staff did a good job and we hope to return here soon.	1
Great place to get drink and soak in the view of LA on a none weekend night.<br><br>Place can get chaotic on the weekend with lines on the street, and the lines to get to the rooftop bar from the restaurant. Don&#39;t come here between 9:30pm to 11pm.<br><br>The crowd are mixed, but could be a little heavy on the wanna be crowd who like to walk around in circle with the same drinks in hand all night long.	1
Stopped in this weekend for a drink with an old friend and ended up having three rounds and dinner. The beers on tap were really surprising. They even had the Sculpin IPA on tap (A top ten, maybe even #1? among the beer fiends at Beer Advocate). <br><br>Only negative was that one woman was running the entire show outside. She was amazing...but we got tired just watching her keeping 75 people happy. If we lived in LA, we&#39;d go here a lot.	1
this is a great place with good food and ambiance. it&#39;s a very cozy restaurant that is perfect for intimate conversation. I only hope the wannabes from river north don&#39;t make their way here. they will kill the place with their maxed out credit cards and lack of sophistication. having an establishment with people who don&#39;t try too hard at being someone they&#39;re not is a great place to be.	1
Love their Pastrami and Matzo Ball soup! Perfect cure for a bad hangover. Open very late at night. They have a bakery when u walk in and a deli counter. You can't go wrong with their sandwiches. Their servers will even recommend you their favorite so don't be shy, ask. ;P	1
I have had a lot of success here. Expense account baby	1
Honest review okay do not come here i was excited because they said this is the best barbeque in chicago its not at all trust me its supper expensive n the portions are so small m its a very small restaurant the entres were cold n gross the sides were great the bread puddin was great i would jus go back for the sides n that not the actual barbeque if u want the best barbeque go to hog wild on 157th its amaizing supper cheap n the portions are huge	0
Never again...I guess they don't have much in the way of Mongolian bbq in Madison but this was a poor excuse for it at best...the meat didn't look fresh...the bar area was not well maintained...food was everywhere...the sauce area was a disaster...the offer you rice and soup to go with your dinner and the rice isn't cooked properly...and the soup was a sad excuse for hot and sour...YUCK!!!	0
Wow. Chef Vinny is a master. His dinner tasting menu last week was phenomenal. I can honestly say it was the first tasting menu that made me feel like I was on an exciting journey--each course so different from the next, incorporating ingredients like thistles that made me taste scallops in a whole way. Even dessert which I can usually do without could not be missed. <br><br>The menu apparently changes every night so I&#39;ll be back again and again.	1
In a land oversaturated with AYCE Korean BBQ joints, KogiKing managed to rise quickly in my ranking of favorite places to go. One of my favorite things about KogiKing is their sheer variety of meats and other dishes that are included for $17.99 (currently $16.99 at time of writing). If you think about it, most places just fill up their menu with flavored versions of pork belly instead of actually offering different cuts of meat. <br><br>At KogiKing, my favorite things to order are most definitely the hangjungsal (pork jowl), daechang (large intestine), and deungshim (rib eye), dosirak (rice lunch box), and of course dwenjangjjigae (bean paste stew). I mean of course the brisket and pork belly are good but let&#39;s not be basic. There&#39;s a reason I&#39;m here and not paying $10 at Bud Namu. <br><br>I assume you have experience with intestines, rib eye, and bean paste stew since they&#39;re basically offered everywhere, so let me go over the less common varietals. The hangjungsal is a little fattier so it might not be your cup of tea but it crisps up so nicely on the outside while being chewy on the outside. Dip it in some salt or ssamjang, wrap it in some rice paper and YUM: mouth orgasm. Definitely better than pork belly in my opinion. Hangjungsal&#39;s definitely not as common to see at AYCE places so it&#39;s definitely a big reason I&#39;m a big fan of KogiKing. The dosirak is basically just an old school tin box with rice, red pepper paste, and dried, salted seaweed strips shaken up in front of you. It&#39;s actually a lot so I never finish it but it&#39;s nice to have. I actually am not a huge fan of the galbi here because it&#39;s pretty salty. It&#39;s pretty good with some rice but I wouldn&#39;t be devastated if we decided not to order it.<br><br>I see a lot of people complaining about how the salad isn&#39;t regular green lettuce but instead onions. Seriously, how unpleasable are you people? Is it really that unfathomable to you that different restaurants do things differently? I find the crisp, sharp onion salad much more refreshing and a better complement to the meat than overly dressed, sweet lettuce but I guess to each their own.<br><br>I also see a lot of complaints about service but it&#39;s been pretty darn good to me. I mean, of course sometimes the servers don&#39;t seem ecstatic about serving you or life in general but considering their job, is that really a surprise? Is there a day that&#39;s gone by where you didn&#39;t hate your job? Give them a break. Usually, the servers are pretty cheerful and really on top of changing the grill for almost every new order and type of meat we order. They&#39;re always down to take a shot with us if we offer and they&#39;re typically really friendly.<br><br>Speaking of shots, you can&#39;t have KBBQ without a little bit of alcohol. KogiKing&#39;s alcohol is cheaper than most other places. I believe it&#39;s $7.99 for a bottle of soju or a big bottle of beer. Cheers to a 300% markup instead of 500% one!	1
I was JUST (just just) given a small gift one single chocolate macaroon. No not the nasty coconut/marzipan sweet nasty Kosher for Passover disasters of my childhood.	1
Not great. I probably won't go back.	0
Good ambiance -- horrid food. Had the crab sando and the Pilgrim and they were miserable. My friend wouldn&#39;t touch it and we were sharing. So I scarfed it. And I KNOW 100% I&#39;m going to yack (and I&#39;m writing this waiting for the check).	0
GREAT FOOD! But no bathrooms... I would come here again though. Seating is limited to about 30. Fast service good for vegetarians.	1
Awesome spot. Very friendly staff. Beautiful, homely decor (I feel like I&#39;m visiting an Italian Grandmother, and I mean that in the best way). In an off-the-beaten-path location that will never attract tourists or williamsburg crowds, so it&#39;s pretty neighborhoody and I love that.<br><br>The brunch is full of simple and classic recipes that are fantastically executed--the home fries are perfect! The oxtail burger is a must-have, the pancakes are done just right, and the egg dishes are cooked perfectly every time (you&#39;d be surprised how many restaurants can fuck up something as simple as an egg, but not Aita!).<br><br>Dinner is even better (or at least more thrilling and creative recipes to choose from). And if you&#39;ve got a long wait, you can have a drink at the sister-bar, Mayflower, which is oh-so-charming.<br><br>So why four stars? At brunch, the coffee leaves a lot to be desired: I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s something like Cafe Bustelo brewed diner style, which is to say not up to the quality of their food. Strange they don&#39;t serve a better roast. Also I tried an Americano there once; it tasted burnt and so bad that I had to send it back (which I rarely ever do). Lastly, it would be nice if they had fresh-squeezed juice available for brunch. But hey, whatever, small prices to pay when the food and ambiance is so great.	1
After watching the Breakfast Pizza on The Best Thing I Ever Ate, I was dying to try this place. The family got up early for a sunday breakfast brunch and it was worth it. We got there right as they were opening so we got seated really quickly and we got amazing service. THe breakfast pizza was worth the trip. (ask for two eggs) and the french toast souffle was a-mazing. so light and delicious and you don&#39;t really need any syrup on it at all but the syrup does enhance the flavors in the souffle. delicious.	1
This is why I go out to eat.	1
This is the place to go for great buttermilk pancakes. The diner emits a cool hipster vibe that matches the Los Feliz neighborhood. it is open at all hours, and even has bar top seating. Good food, good service, and a good area to hang out in.	1
Definitely a great seafood restaurant in Annapolis.  The view could be better, but there was nothing else to complain about.	0
First time here - what a great place! The guy behind the counter was nice and informative. He was patient while I made up my mind and called my coworker to ask what she wanted on her meal. I checked in for the free queso and upon getting to my office everything was still warm! The burrito I got was very big, I saved half of it to take home. Everything had great flavor and for $8 per person, I will definitely be back. Happy to see quality, affordable food still exists around the area.	1
The delivery time is so irritating and the food is mediocre at best. I live just a couple of blocks away and it took over an hour and a half...ridiculous! How is that acceptable? They should get their delivery problem fixed or they will lose a lot of business.	0
Definitely over hyped. It&#39;s a trendy spot for hipster/young crowd, but I will not be returning. <br><br>Ambiance: Open kitchen, smelled delicious when we walked in! Good music, but it got loud around 8pm and we kinda had to yell and repeat ourselves in conversation. Empty at 6.<br><br>Service: Ok they were attentive with refills. Food comes out at different times (told us after we ordered). My friends got their food roughly 15-20 minutes before I did. <br><br>Food: Small portions; kinda like tapas. This is how they make $$ because you aren&#39;t really full with one if their small dish which average around $16. <br><br>We got the pork with pork grind and watermelon dish (forgot name) which was zesty salty and sweet; lots of fatty pork... The mussels were very small and some of them were not opened. None of the dishes come with rice, jasmine rice is $3...<br><br>The curry noodles-khao soi was salty because the noodle to soup ratio was off.... there was very small pieces of meat and mainly consisted of soup and what seemed to be the chinese preserved/pickled cabbage. As a result the taste was savory curry like and slight tang/sour from the cabbage leaves. Taste was decent but not enough ingredients to call it a good dish. <br><br>We shared halo halo which was yummy. Piece of pudding, coconut meat, shave ice, rice crispy cereal, condensed milk, and banana? <br><br>Good experience but don&#39;t recommend it if you&#39;re going out just to eat here, maybe if you happen to be in the neighborhood. <br><br>Total cost: $63	0
The outside atmosphere was great, looked like Europe.<br>I didn&#39;t make it for the live music, but I was inpressed by the instruments.<br>We started with the fries that were delicious.<br>Food: Ahi Burger<br>I took off the bun top to add wasabi and the hand made patti looked as if 2-3 bites were taken out. I would not have noticed if I didn&#39;t take off the bun. It could have been that a chunk fell off when it was on thr grill, but I didn&#39;t want to chance it. I waited about 5 minutes while trying to wave over wait staff. The waitress was apologetic and said she agreed that is was not normal and she went to order another for me. While I had no food and my dining partner did, I bit into one of his wings, which looked and smelled delicious. My teeth could not rip the chicken from the bone and I looked and saw blood. At this point I had pretty much had it. She came back with my new burger with soggy original bun and offered new wings but by this point I was not interested in eating. The beer and wine were good. However I was very disappointed in the food. the service was O.K.	0
I had to wait until the guilt of eating the all-too-fried sampler to wane before writing this review. <br><br>Now, that that&#39;s gone -- I feel great about the yummy fried goodness from Cabanas!! Everything that your excess-loving heart desires is in the sampler we ordered that delightful night. <br><br>It has chicharron, chunks of meat, a tamal, pupusas, and yuca frita. <br><br>Everything was delish. It took a little long to get our food especially since they are less than a hop, skip and a jump away.	1
Considering there are about four other Cuban restaurants in a 2 mile radius, you&#39;d figured they&#39;d try to get orders correct or at least be pleasant and courteous when you call them on it. Well, it&#39;s not the case. Anything can happen once but when it continues happening I think it&#39;s time to call the one a couple blocks away.	0
Great place for brunch and mimosas.	1
The music is good but hot as he&#39;ll in here and the line is ridiculous. The guard at the entrance was rude.	0
I&#39;ve had the ahi taco and China boat. The presentation is nice but the taste doesn&#39;t meet my expectations. I can cut open a cat of tuna and place it on a cucumber and it&#39;ll taste the same. <br><br>The pricing is way too expensive as well.	0
its good	1
Came here with 2 friends on the blind recommendation that ABC Kitchen had a wonderful reputation and was supposedly amazing. It was Halloween Eve, so one friend was dressed in a Jets costume, and I in a Stepford Wife get up.<br>The place is decorated like my dream - very Anthropologie-esque, classic baroque, deconstructed. I absolutely loved the style. What I didn&#39;t like was being sat at the high tops by the bar that felt super unsturdy and like cheap plastic patio furniture on stilts. Don&#39;t worry, thats not the only thing I didn&#39;t like.<br><br>ABC Kitchen is all about fresh local organic everything, down to the beers. Wonderful. Great. (If you&#39;re into all that). I also feel our server was all about attitude, judgement and making an art out of not serving. Actually, the girl who was helping to bus was more friendly and engaging than our actual server, who barely looked at us and who had to be flagged down with immense effort to even put an order in. Once we did order, and I guess he realized we were spending money there, he began to do his job slightly better, but that really wasn&#39;t saying much at all.<br><br>Food. We split the calamari to start, which was super salty and paired with a super salty mustard dipping sauce and a very bland marinara. It was only until the last few bites that I cracked the code and mixed the bland with the salty to make acceptable to be washed down with my Lime Basil mojito. I have to say one positive thing - the Lime Basil mojito was great. Fresh, interesting, tasty, and strong. We also had a fresh mozzarella and fig salad - the mozzarella was tasteless and nothing special. We were not a fan of the figs in combination with the mozzarella. Disappointing.<br><br>The entrees - which took forever to come out - were not particularly fantastic either. This was probably amplified by the pretentious air circulating around the restaurant and the attitude the server was giving us. At least for cripes sake have some foodgasm worthy dishes to make me think there is something to substantiate the attitude. <br><br>I had the Sea Bass with potatoes and spinach. While continuing a conversation, I was emptying a whole shaker of salt and pepper into the dish to possibly shock some life into the otherwise bland and runny dish. I&#39;m sorry folks. Sadly, it was DOA. Very bland. Very disappointing. My friend had the Kasha and Bowtie pasta with Veal Meatballs, which was mediocre, but a bit on the salty side for the meatballs. Also somewhat disappointing. My other dinnermate opted for one of the pizzas which looked very dry and she was not amused at all.<br><br>Naturally, we continued to down the drinks, which were honestly the best part of our meal, and opted out of staying for dessert.<br><br>Bottom line? Super cute space. Super uncute attitude. Super bland and unimpressive dishes for the price and attitude we had to endure. Do not recommend, unless pretentiousness is your schtick. <br><br>This review is now bland in itself, because there is no other word to adequately describe the banality of the food. That is untrue. There surely are, but the food was so ____ that I do not find it worth reaching into my vocabulary repertoire to describe it anymore.	0
Medium rare bowery burger with the works: gruyere, caramelized onions, bacon, and jalapenos. Super good. I was wary about the use of an english muffin instead of a bun but it turned out ok. It actually helped keep the burger from falling apart. This burger is pricey though... with a side of fries expect a $20 bill.<br><br>(PS came for lunch on a Saturday and the place was empty. Took almost a half hour for our food to come out, which sucked. But at least the burger turned out well!)	1
If you are a local in the area, the first thing you notice is that this was a terrible IHOP before...ah but don&#39;t be fooled, Peruvian Chicken awaits you!<br><br>Sadly my first time eating here i ordered the Lomo (beef) when i completely ignore my own restaurant rule (like, don&#39;t order a burger at a Seafood restaurant or don&#39;t order the French fries at the Pizza joint, etc.). This is a chicken place, order the chicken! Not to say that the Lomo was bad but after tasting their chicken, it did not compare. Thankfully my wife ordered the chicken (she shared some with me...thanks babe) and it was fantastic, will be back for that...i&#39;ll get it right next time.<br><br>Honorable mentions:<br><br>* Plentiful Peruvian sauces to choose from. Spicy goodness!<br><br>* Friendly staff<br><br>* Plenty of seating, also available for pick-up (spoke with whom i believe was the manager, told me they will have a delivery service soon for the local area)<br><br>*Fried Yucca was yummy.	1
Time for an update.	1
I love these smaller NY and SF-style restaurants that keep popping up. The Six has solid food and a quaint, rustic atmosphere. TVs hang in the corners, which is a little odd since it&#39;s more a restaurant than a bar, but they were showing old movies, which was kind of cool. I made reservations for 4 people on a Saturday night, but actually didn&#39;t need to. Food-wise the only thing I didn&#39;t like was the cassoulet. I LOVE cassoulet so I&#39;m on the pickier side, but this was basically a skillet of beans. Skip it. The mussels, however, were delightful as was the parmesan cheese covered corn on the cob. The server even took it back to have it cut into 4 pieces. The tomato and burrata salad was fresh and light and creamy- definitely a highlight. And it was a nice-sized portion as well! I&#39;d like to go back and try the burger, as well as a few other things on the menu next time.	1
Wish I could give zero stars. Ordered and waited 25 minutes before they told me they had to make what I ordered. Why bother...great Mexican food across the street at San Loco. This place is miserable.	0
I don&#39;t know how Distilled managed a four and a half rating on here. I was completely disappointed with my entire meal after visiting. And I usually don&#39;t give a restaurant 1 star unless the service, along with the food, has underperformed. That wasn&#39;t the case here, the service was fine but everything else was a problem. <br><br>The main issue is how over priced everything is. I understand the restaurant is in TriBeCa but don&#39;t serve two scallops and a tiny piece of duck and charge $30 - without even a side dish. My girlfriend ordered the pork ribs in a basket and again $25 for maybe 4 small ribs with zero taste that were no bigger than my pinky. Don&#39;t get me wrong I don&#39;t mind paying top dollar for quality food but nothing that I tried left a lasting memory. <br><br>We order 4 drinks, 1 app, 2 entrees and a desert and the meal was over $150. I left starving. I can go to a steak house for that much. The restaurant is also very bland - decor and menu. I hear the burgers are good but I just have such a bad taste in my mouth from my last visit I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ll be back go give it a try.	0
This place has the best chicken &amp; waffles in Vegas. The chicken is well seasoned and the waffles taste great! I would give it 5 stars but the place itself is extremely small so it fills up quick during lunch and sometimes there&#39;s no tables left. It&#39;s worth the wait though!	1
The menu is absurdly big, but all you need to know is MATZO BALL SOUP. Or in the case that you&#39;re running a marathon in the near future and you need to carb load (or you just need to carb load, AMIRITE LADIESSSSS?), Mish-Mosh, which is just the matzo ball soup but now with 80% more carbs! They will also bring you a massive plate of pickles and bagel chips if you ask politely, because they care about you and they wouldn&#39;t let you leave with lower blood pressure than what you came in with. Speaking of blood pressure, definitely try the Fresser - it&#39;s got corned beef and pastrami because it&#39;s just too hard to make the call sometimes. I got 99 problems but deciding between pastrami and corned beef is now officially not one. <br><br>If all this isn&#39;t enough for you, go ahead and get yourself some of the onion rings and a Mai Tai (I know I sound like a maniac, but the Mai Tais are really good here!), because you&#39;re already well on your way to cardiac arrest so, why not. There is this one waitress who I love and she&#39;s always saying things like &#34;well, I&#39;m not supposed to, but for you, I&#39;ll ask my friend in the back&#34; and she brings us onion rings with a sandwich even though they technically can&#39;t do the onion rings with sandwiches. Bless that lady. One time a homeless guy came up to us just after we got our food and he asked my boyfriend for his food, so my boyfriend gave the homeless guy half his sandwich. The waitress saw that exchange and she had the kitchen make my bf another half a sandwich and wrap it to go, which was really nice but unnecessary -- even half a sandwich from Canters is a more than full meal for someone with a reasonable appetite.<br><br>Also, they frequently have live music and other things (want some open mic night with your tuna salad?) in the bar, which is sorta fun. They&#39;re really hawking their affiliation with Guns&#39;n&#39;Roses via the Kibitz room lately, but it lends an air of debauchery and dim fluorescence that is very comforting to me. Parking is available for a small fee in the lot at the south corner of the block that Canter&#39;s is on, and god forbid you return to your car without getting at least 3 cookies out of the bakery case up front. I am a huge fan of the mini rugelach and the black and white cookies, but there&#39;s a cookie for everyone there. Except gluten free vegans, who should never set foot in Canter&#39;s anyway. Long live our noble Canter&#39;s.	1
Sigh. I miss Manny&#39;s. Are you guys ever coming back?	1
Our Coffee was luke warm and our breakfast sandwiches were burnt and I had one small chicken sausage link for my entire sandwich. I wouldn&#39;t recommend this place to anyone. We will not be coming back!	0
The tacos are bomb! I&#39;m just not a fan of how much rice you get and I LOVE me rice! Very affordable and I believe students get free soda! Just show your ID! Check groupon too! They sometimes have good discounts for this location	1
This place is a super chill place open late and we shut them down, so thank you for accommodating us so late! We drank our weight in wine and then, around 2/230a decided we wanted food. Any other place would call you a fool but this place served us up hot, fresh, tasty polenta, hummuses (hummi?), cheese platters and of course, more wine. Then, when we inevitably needed a cab the bartender had one at the door for us in less than 5. Maybe because he wanted us to leave but he didn&#39;t show it. This is also the place where all the local industry folk come after their restaurants shut down, so this place must be doing something right, no? Only problem was it was a chilly Miami night yet he had to keep the front door open due to the kitchen fumes, so we froze a little (solution? Wine.)	1
Food is good but portions are kind of small. Price is fair	1
Meow Meow!	1
The waiters are excellent and she could not stop me from coming here even if she try. Fresh and very tasty!!!!	1
Best burger ever. It is truly like eating a cloud of meat.	1
We went there for Memorial Day to make it feel like we were home. I had a hot dog with chips and mayo on it! Does it get better than that?!	1
This place is an institution. It&#39;s been around since the glamor days of Claudette Colbert and Clark Gable and is still serving up a mean bowl of matzo ball soup and towering pastrami onto rye. Every time I catch a film at LACMA that gets out around midnight I head over to Canter&#39;s on Fairfax which is open 24 hours a day. When I can&#39;t eat a whole sandwich I just get their stuffed potato and a side of sauerkraut. Most of the waitresses seem like they&#39;ve worked there since the &#39;50s, hairnets and all, and can be surly at times but they only add to the character of the place. Past midnight some nights there is live music in the back at the bar.	1
Small place with good sushi. Service can be a little slow or lacking but they are new.	1
Okay I finally got to try the legit Ramen burger made from Keizo Shimamoto who first introduced it in New York. It is the bomb. For all you non asian people reading this review. This burger is a must to your foodie list. Located as a window, next to the mysterious Lock and Key on Vermont in Ktown,this place is practically a diamond in the rough. The burger yet so simple and kind of small will surprise your tastebuds and send you on a Japanese soup escapade into the genious of the Shimamoto family. The evening we went, we brought one of our friends who's a restauranteur and she was amazed at the concept. She's Japanese and she knows quite a bit about food. You can tell she was quite impressed. The first time you try this burger , try it naked without all the extras it will most definitely surprise you. Next time add all the fixins and you'll be surprised all over again. The owner of the restaurant Keizos brother Jeff, you can tell really loves and puts his personality into it. Which is a big plus. It makes me want to come back not only for the burger but to shoot the breeze about food in LA (period) Here's a tip: if you're on a night on the town , Lock and Key also serves the burger so go in for a few drinks with your burger.	1
Good food and right around the street from my place. The roommate R and I usually order for delivery after we've melted into the couches. Definitely worth stopping by!	1
We had a quick lunch here after stopping in to buy cookies at Sweet E&#39;s next door. We started with the rich and creamy corn chowder. It was really tasty though it could have used a bit of salt. My friend had the tuna sandwich with crispy onion rings. I had the huge triple decker club sandwich which included turkey, bacon, tomatoes, Swiss cheese, mayo, lettuce, three slices of bread. This sandwich was so big, I could not get my mouth around it! I had some well-done fries on the side. Service is good and we sat outside on the lovely patio.	1
two words. shrimp burrito.also chips & guacamole nothing beats em.	1
**4.5 Stars**<br>CASH ONLY<br><br>I had the most amazing dinner experience here this past Saturday!<br>My bf and I were the first ones in line. We showed up promptly at 4:20PM as it is a 10-person max ramen restaurant and only open Tuesday-Saturday from 5-10PM. By 4:45 there was already almost 20 people behind us! At 4:55 they started letting the first batch of 10 inside.<br>There are only 2 kinds of ramen: <br>1. Shoyu with pork<br>2. Vegetarian miso (you can add pork to the miso for $3)<br>The only topping you have a choice to add is an egg ($2).<br><br>My bf ordered the shoyu ramen with egg and I ordered the miso ramen with pork. The shoyu had a very light and clean broth. It was delicious and aromatic. Additionally, the egg was perfectly cooked. My miso ramen was wonderful. It was a little heavier than the shoyu-- plus they give you a pat of butter on the side, I added half which made the broth more rich and delectable. The noodles also differed from that of the shoyu. It soaked in the flavor so well! <br>The portions are generous- I could not finish my bowl. The workers are friendly and you watch as the head chef prepares the meal!<br><br>They serve water in cute beakers! They also have other drinks such as tea and beer available.<br><br>FYI: There are no seats-- just a counter you stand in front of. There are hooks on the wall to hang your stuff. This place has a feel of a small Japanese ramen shop where you just eat a delicious meal, pay, and go on your way.	1
I have been to this location twice, and both times it was pretty good. The extra star is for the fireworks display they put on their cakes for peoples&#39; birthdays. It makes you feel special. The two gripes about this place is that it is too damn dark in there and the appetizers and desserts yet exceptional, are kinda pricey.<br><br>Goat cheese fondue - pretty good, it was a bit cold. And I usually imagine a pot of fondue, not a small ramekin.<br>Red sangria - Meh, I enjoyed the alcoholic fruit more than the actual alcohol.<br>Vegetable risotto (blue plate, $11) - Presentation was lacking. Risotto plopped on a black plate--looked like Stouffer&#39;s frozen food. It was flavorful and seasoned well, but not true risotto.<br>Pan seared trout with lemon beurre blanc and roasted potatoes (blue plate, $13) - Uh oh, a special on fish on a Sunday. Bourdain taught me not to order fish on Sundays or Mondays, but this fish was seared and cooked perfectly -- and tasted fresh in my book. The lemon beurre blanc was very zesty. Might be overpowering for some, but i think it gave the fish another layer. The pan seared potatoes were crispy and delish.<br><br>Desserts I tried:<br>Fried apple pie with ice cream - meh, ice cream was decent.<br>Chocolate lava cake - nothing special<br>Chocolate peanut butter pie - wow. smooth, rich, creamy, yum.<br>Smores - the marshmallows were pre-melted! I wished they let us roast our own marshmallows as I have seen at other restaurants. Still good.<br><br>Service was excellent, it felt like i took a sip and turned back a few seconds later to see it filled. It was a light night so they were probably overstaffed.	1
Very good food for a good price.	1
The most incredible burger experience I have ever had nothing like you would expect of a burger place a bit expensive but well worth the experience.	1
Also going to Yak's since the 80's. My nefew started at the U and asked about good old haunts. Not as close as he wants but I'm taking him to Yak's!	1
Does Acai bowl mean anything to you? If it doesn&#39;t then you are completely missing out. 10 Fruits makes the best acia bowls; my fav is the coconut one that comes with organic acai, banana, blueberry. coconut water, soy milk &amp; coconut palm sugar. Oh, and it&#39;s topped with quinoa amaranth granola, banana &amp; toasted coconut! Damn, it&#39;s good !	1
This is a super sweet family owned cafe. It&#39;s not in the greatest area but right on the border of Venice. It&#39;s very eclectic and cozy. The owner is a doll. I&#39;m sitting here watching her tackle order and treat every customer with kindness by herself. I&#39;m a total health nut (no dairy/gluten/processed sugar) this place offers all kinds of accommodations for nut jobs like myself! Definitely check it out! Show this small business owner some love!	1
So me and my coworkers wanted try something new and found the park. After a confusion of where to sit, the waitress told us to wait so she can clean the table. By the time she did that we decided just to sit outside. the table was dirty and 5 minutes later another guy cleaned it. They told us to get our own water which was warm so we did. After a while they brought us our menus. The waitress sucked the entire time. She did not smile and looked like she hated her job which is why she did not get a tip from us. Another guy came up to our table and was very rude to me just because I had another bag with food in it which I have not even started eating. He was not our waiter and told us a lame excuse that my food is a health violation when I am sure thats the least of their worries. He was sarcastic and pissed us off. There menu is pretty expensive just for a sandwich. The food was average, nothing special. The food took about 45 minutes for them to bring and no apologies about that. This place sucked and we will never go there again. Sometimes its just easier to stick with the places you go to regularly and a big middle finger to that rude guy who wasnt even our server. Your lucky I didnt make a scene in your stupid restaurant.<br><br>The place is not special at all, go somewhere else.	0
No reason for this food to be any higher than 2 stars. Least flavorful Indian restaurant I have ever been to.	0
Only special about this place is the view of the bay bridge!	0
This place was lots of fun and the presentation was so much fun. I had the salmon and it was alright. The cotton candy was to die for but overly priced. I had made reservations but we had to wait over 30 mins until we were seated. There was no stools at the bar so we had to stand around and have our drinks while waiters were trying to get around to serve their tables. Hopefully next time we go we won't have to experience to wait.	1
Best hotdogs in Washington state and if you are a beer drinker only the Parkway Tavern can provide a better selection. The combo of brews and dogs can't be beat. The service is more favorable to your regularity. If you are regular you are part of the Red Hot community.	1
The crowd was okay, place is pretty fancy. My experience was amazing really great drinks and appetizers the view of LA skyline is why I love my city so much! Would def be back to have some leisure time with a group of friends!	1
Came here one night with Jaron right before they closed. Thought they would hate me because most cafes do when I make them make me fresh coffee a few minutes to closing. But the barista still made it. And he gave full explanations for all of the cool looking desserts. <br><br>And then I saw a piano upstairs, so I forced Jaron to go play it. I joined him and sang a few songs. The staff like the way the music bounced off of the open-spaced industrial loft and said we were welcome to come by and make music any time.<br><br>We&#39;ll try to make it a habit. But while I&#39;m stuck in a stale corporate building, I follow their blog &amp; twitter and pretend I&#39;m a freelancer listening to the music and seeing the scenes that they post.<br><br>-Jen	1
We got a 20&#34; sub packed with meat and vegetables for $12. What a deal! But if we knew they put coleslaw in the pastrami sandwich we wouldn&#39;t have ordered it. It just didn&#39;t taste right. I love pastrami sandwiches and am used to having it with fresh vegges and mustard. Though pricing was good, taste wise this was the worst pastrami sandwich I&#39;ve had.	0
We had to wait awhile for our table. Guests just didn't want to leave. They where very nice and brought us free drinks for our wait. Dinner was great.	1
Have tried this conveniently located SOMA pub/cafe several times, and while the talented trio of musicians that play weekend evenings are enjoyable, the food is barely palatable...even by lowly bar food standards. Horribly bland, wholly forgettable, and usually served lukewarm. Of the half dozen dishes we've tried over three visits to BH (i.e., fish&chips, burgers, pastas) they all share one consistency: incredibly greasy. Blech.Do yourself a favor and pop in for the music and maybe a beer--but eat elsewhere beforehand.	0
amazing dinner.<br><br>everything we had was cooked to perfection, seasoned well, and overall fantastic. heirloom tomato salad was bursting with flavor and freshness, with an amazing cilantro vinagrette. duck fat and potato croquettes were sooo tasty we wanted more. sausage was good, maybe a little dry. risotto was flavorful and topped with bacon.<br><br>dessert was great too. pumpkin whoopie pie with vanilla was light and refreshing, lemon dessert with graham cracker crust was even better.<br><br>i would stick to wine rather than the cocktails, they were a little too simple for my taste. the gin and juice literally was gin with grapefruit juice. the drink with mint needed a little more sweetness for balance.<br><br>nice too that everything is locally sourced, fresh and organic, you can taste the difference. <br><br>supposedly their menu changes, so i can&#39;t wait to go back. this place is in my top five. better yet, it&#39;s reasonably priced	1
Probably the most unique and most flavorful taco&#39;s I&#39;ve ever had. Couldn&#39;t think of just a few off the menu to try, so we ordered one of each and did it family style. The combination of ingredients were what really blew me away. Beer selection is great too. From whats on tap to whats in bottle, they cover a large variety of selection. I will be back soon!	1
Ok I took off a start ONLY because of the location (people wandering in looking for water, etc...) But the food here was AMAZING... every single item we had was unique and absolutely amazing. Even seafood we typically don&#39;t like was prepared so well that we were reconsidering our positions on them. We have the pineapple full of spicy seafood--weird sounding, I know, but it was absolutely delightful. I can&#39;t wait to go back and try more stuff!	1
I had a great burger called the six, highly recommend. And there Brussel sprouts are the <a href="/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&amp;s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">bomb.com</a>	1
Fate brought me to Garden Grill.<br><br>We had plans to be in Vegas for the weekend. Because we were gonna be in town, I entered to win tickets to the Life Is Beautiful music festival. Then I won two 3-day VIP passes thanks to Yelp LA West CM Brittany F.! Immediately did my research and discovered that Garden Grill was going to be serving up some vegan goodies at the festival.<br><br>Sh*t just got real!<br><br>At this point, I didn&#39;t even care about the bands anymore (except for Fitz and the Tantrums). All I could think about was BBQ Pulled Jackfruit Tacos and Beer Battered Avocado Tacos.<br><br>The line was surprisingly long. I didn&#39;t realize vegan food would be so popular at a music festival. But I guess that&#39;s a good thing. Each taco was offered at two for $8 but sadly they wouldn&#39;t let you mix and match that day. Later on I discovered that there&#39;s a Yelp check-in offer for $1 off your first order that I wish I knew about before hand. I also noticed that the taco prices listed on their website is $1 less than what they offered it for at the festival. Damn those festival prices!<br><br>Great BBQ flavor in the Jackfruit Tacos and I liked the crunchy mix of shredded cabbage in there. The creamy dill sauce on top was tasty too. <a href="/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1E7np5J&amp;s=9be583288d0f6d68b7b33e7260b42021d42938288d2ac833594e03bf3d85a77b" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">bit.ly/1E7np5J</a><br><br>The portion was much smaller than I would have liked it to be for $8. Let&#39;s just say, on the drive back to LA, I stopped by a vegan market/cafe (Viva La Vegan in Rancho Cucamonga) and their jackfruit tacos were a much bigger and filling size at $3 a taco.<br><br>I was still hungry after eating Garden Grill&#39;s jackfruit tacos so I ended up ordering the Beer Battered Avocado Tacos in which the serving size was significantly bigger. Large chunks of avocado batter fried in a way that doesn&#39;t make the avocado taste cooked (which I prefer). More crunchy shredded cabbage and a delicious creamy cilantro pepita dressing and Sriracha. It&#39;s very messy to eat but yum yum yum yum YUM! <a href="/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1yKXca0&amp;s=89b184de6bdeb7b44e851282c3f44afd4d8af78128afd252191f10d607c0e5f9" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">bit.ly/1yKXca0</a><br><br>The meateater BF was curious about the menu too so he ordered a Chick&#39;n Ceasar Salad Wrap with grilled chick&#39;n, ceasar dressing, croutons and romaine lettuce wrapped in a yummy spinach tortilla. I thought it was tasty! The meateater BF said he liked it better than the meaty prime beef sandwich from T-bones Chophouse a few tents down from Garden Grill. Yay for hooking the meateater! <a href="/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F10DEeac&amp;s=7444d2034aa93ae0686f34f9a572e790e70fd345ce7f51dd528527b5d0dc9e9a" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">bit.ly/10DEeac</a><br><br>Yeah it&#39;s kinda pricey but the sad truth is, I would pay that much for their deliciousness. They get 5-stars from me! I just wish I had room for the Raw Chocolate Cheezecake while we were there.	1
We went here for my wife&#39;s 30th Birthday and were treated like royalty. I made a mistake on the reservations and they worked their best to make it work, well they did that and a whole lot more. Working with Ginger the GM was by far one of the best things to happen. She and her staff went above and beyond what was expected. Her precise attention to detail and caring demeanor made my wife&#39;s birthday and everyone involved night a complete success. Thank you to all of you who helped. You really are the best!<br><br>p.s the view is to die for!	1
Fresh Sushi. Crunchy Tempura. Green Tea Ice Cream. It all hits the spot.	1
Have only had pastry and coffee here but just the &#34;milky toast&#34; alone is so worth the stars. I&#39;ve walked 5 blocks in the freezing cold just to buy a few orders.<br><br>The staff is so sweet and the vibe is super clean, modern and cheerful.	1
Went there for brunch on a rainy Sunday and I'm sad to say my experience was pretty disappointing. My boyfriend and I arrived around 10am and was told the wait time is around 35 minutes. I peeked at the wait list and saw one table for 3 and one table for 6 (4 adults &amp; 2 kids) in front of us; since I saw the couples sitting by the window asking for the bill, I thought to myself, 35 minutes seem reasonable. 5 minutes later the table by the window freed up, and they sat the table for 3 in the back so I asked if we can just sit by window; the hostess told me that spot is being saved for the table for 6 (even though the people sitting at the other end of that table just got their food). Next thing I know they sat three tables of 3 and I have waited for 55 minutes (note: there're 7 additional tables for 2 waiting by that time). Finally we sat down (note: the table for 6 haven't even ordered yet as they were just seated 10 minutes prior to that), immediately ordered our food as I saw fellow yelpers complaining about the long wait for food.	1
I come from South Jersey where a 45 minute drive you can pick up a cheesesteak (WIZ WID) from Philly. So I am biased. The bread was ok and felt almost stale. It was just not that good overall. I&#39;ve had the burger sub, italian, and chicken cheese. Nothing else to really say about this place.<br><br>Personally I would rather go to Subways or Quiznos even though I appreciate a local sub shop this isn&#39;t good enough to goto over a corporate one like Subways.	0
This place is definitely "no thrills", but what they lack in variety and decor, they make up for in quality. I ordered the Hickory Burger and will say it is definitely the best burger I have ever had. I love the smokiness in the burger. Their fries are just okay. They're steak fries and cooked well-done. Their pies looked incredible, but I was so full from the burger, I didn't have enough room to try any that day. I will definitely be coming back.The only down-side is finding parking as well as a seat. The place is small and it's tough if you're in a walker.	1
A friend and I decided to check this place out for lunch and let's just say we've both had better. The food was just mediocre and I really dislike the fact that my quesadilla was just so dry and tasteless.	0
If you are in the mood for a very special night out Anthony's is in my top 5 in Las Vegas. We tend to dine out 6 nights a week and have tried them all. We regularly go to Anthony's due to 1. The Staff 2. The View  3. The Bar and Wine List 4. The ambience . 5. The food. All are equally special. (Don't overlook the exotic meats on the menu. The chef can prepare them as well as anyone)	1
This place is sooo goooood. Tastes very authentic. Ordered the beef boti kabob, chicken biriyani, garlic naan, and mango lassi. The beef boti kabob was amazinggggg wow. It was so tender and flavorful. It was perfect with some sauce and garlic naan. The chicken biriyani was really good too. Everything was what I expected to be and more! The workers here are really friendly. I would definitely come back here again.	1
Loved this quaint little nook. A small, beautifully lit 12 person eatery, offering healthy, local and fresh Japanese set lunch. I&#39;ll be back next weekend, and the next, and the next. Especially loved the handmade pottery and the colorful plating!	1
Had my birthday brunch here at Perch recently. I made reservations before hand and was disappointed to hear that an outside table could not be promised depending on how busy it is. But I was happy to walk right In and be told by the nice hostess that there were plenty of tables outside with a great view. Overall brunch was good. Mimosas were good and the vibe was nice. I had a wonderful birthday brunch.	1
Tourist trap beware! The alcoholic beverages are heavily overpriced $30+ for some mixed drinks, the service is extremely slow during nights and weekends. You may have to wait 45-60 minutes for food (if they haven&#39;t run out). Only perk is the oysters are good quality and taste great.	0
I can't believe this is my 500th review...But I'm feeling kinda lazy today so here goes nothin'...Great mac and cheese with ham and broccoli.Great pork cutlet.Great sangria.Great service. Great ambiance.This place is great. Yay 500~!!	1
Quick, no real service here but man are they fast. Amazing burgers. My only gripe: mediocre apple pie. Isn&#39;t that supposed to be what they are known for? <br><br>Apparently not. If you notice other reviews as well, people opt for banana cream.	1
We had to wait more than 30 minutes beyond our scheduled reservation time to be seated, though we were told multiple times that it would just be 5 minutes. This not acceptable for this caliber of restaurant. Overbooking tables, then flat out lying to your customers does not make a for a nice start to the evening. Given this, you would think the manager would have at least apologized and offered a free appetizer but he/she could not even be bothered to speak to us even after we asked the hostess. It's a shame because the food was quite good.	0
A welcoming, cozy coffee shop with the nicest dude ever working the counter. I got a flat white which came in a fishbowl sized mug and... Wasn&#39;t quite right. It was good but the texture was off or something. Just milk in a bowl. My buddy got a chai, but the masala contained no tea and the warm water he was given was insufficient for brewing. After two attempts to get it rectified he switched to their pre-made chai latte and found it good. They did not fuss at all about the requests. <br><br>They have a sweetener called &#34;silan&#34; on the sugar counter; I asked what it was. Apparently they make their own date syrup, so I gave it a shot. Delicious, and I would happily use that in all my coffee drinks. <br><br>Will come back some time. Very excellent people.	1
I've been here a number of times over several years including tonight for dinner (haven't had lunch/brunch).	1
First I want to say that I am a picky person when I go out to eat. It needs to be better then I can make it at home. I am a good cook. 	1
The food is terrific!	0
The worst service/management ever. Half empty restaurant could not get a waiter for 15 minutes. Called over manager who finally took our cocktail order, took ten more minutes to get it. He stated they were complimentary due to the wait. Actually they were complimentary due to being basicly colored water. Then waitress then took 15 more minutes to show up. We have never left a restaurant before but we had to. Five star prices require professional service, I think this place is run by students, including the manager.	0
Cool vibe, Indifferent to bordering on rude hostess and servers, food was pretty good. We had the fried calamari and it was without a doubt the best I&#39;ve ever had. Served immediately to us, piping hot (one thing I&#39;ll say is they don&#39;t let the food sit around cooling off before they bring it to you) and delicious. I had the blackened brick chicken with the mashed potatoes/Brussels sprouts, a delicious comforting plate. Which I needed because the staff was so chilly and the noise in the place was so bad I literally felt like I was dining alone. Any attempt at conversation was impossible, so I recommend trying to get seating directly next to your companion as opposed to across from. I might go back again as the food was pretty good, but I&#39;ll steer clear of the witchy hostess stand and seat myself at a bar table. The rating is based on 4 stars for food and vibe,1 for service.	0
Love the atmosphere, love the food, and the bar is wonderful. They make their own homemade tonic which is delicious! The list of craft liquors from around the region is quite commendable. I just wish they were open later on Friday and Saturday!	0
This place offers a variety of burgers. Since it was my first time, I just wanted to try the original Umami Burger. Oh, and the truffle cheese fries! The patty was juicy and thick. The burger was so well put together. It wasn't messy at all. The flavor is definitely asian influenced, but if you don't like that type of flavor, they have so many other kinds of burgers you can try. The roasted garlic aioli that came with the truffle cheese fries complimented it really well. It's basically just garlic mayo.	1
Traditional Clam Chowder	1
We were excited to try this place with all the rave reviews. But sadly we were very disappointed. We sat there for 10 minutes without a simple hello. All the while numerous other guests were helped. All which arrived after us. The restaurant wasn&#39;t even that busy.	0
Went here for dinner, Burgers were tasty but expensive since fries aren't included and basic toppings cost extra( e.g. onions or pickles). Don't get the wings appetizer i think it was $9 for like 5 mediocre wings which was a rip-off. Also, they don't have any beers on tap so be prepared for $4 for a bottle or can. Overall pretty so-so experience but free peanuts were good!	0
I'm extremely picky with ramen having grown up in an area with tons of Japanese food & people. I ordered the chasu ramen. The only thing I liked about this place was the flavor of the broth, tho it was very greasy. The noodles were average. The meat was very dry & everything tasted bland. Because I went at lunch time, I ordered the lunch special, so I added the chahan to my order of ramen. I had hopes that it would be good because most Japanese fried rice is good, but this was a huge disappointment. The rice was very heavy on grease & had no flavor at all. I had to ask for a side of ginger to give it more flavor, but even the ginger was bad. I tried my boyfriends karaage & that didn't taste good at all either. The frying at this place needs some work. If I have anything good to say about this place is that the prices are decent & they have a wide selection of dishes to choose from. Personally, I would not come here again or recommend it to friends. I prefer ajisen ramen over this place.	0
this had been my second time into Distilled, the first went off without a hitch good food average service. But The second time I came in a little over a week ago I was with my family, elderly mother and daughter age 9. We were sitting in a booth, waiter was very friendly food took a little longer than expected to arrive but nothing to crazy, we are enjoying our meal when I hear a cook (Im assuming the head chef) begins to very loudly swear at one of his line cooks repeatedly, and may I stress repeatedly. It would be one thing if it were one and done but this was over the course of about 30 minutes. Our waiter took note of our obvious discomfort being in earshot of such a rude man and apologized on his behalf. Coming from a management position myself I know there are stressful situations that come with having to manage employees but this head chefs attitude and treatment of his employee was inexcusable and to swear within earshot of customers is simply unprofessional and not the way a manager should treat his employees. Its disappointing because they have good food but because of this poor display we will never be returning to the restaurant as a family again, I may return with a coworker and enjoy a drink but as I do you can be assured I will be crossing my fingers that our peaceful evening does not get disrupted again.	0
The food is 3 1/2 stars but the service and atmosphere are 1 at best. They just really need to make up their mind about what kind of restaurant they want to be. White table cloths but they put a sheet of paper over them, too fancy to push two tables together for a large party, but when you order a coke you get a warm unopened can and a glass of ice. Is this a burger joint or a sit down restaurant? I don&#39;t think they even know.	0
I got to try them at the food fest. LOVED the lobster balls. I had some kind of sandwich too with Thai coleslaw and I think the brisket used in their Pho. Wish I could remember the name, it was so yummy!	1
I wanted to love this place, and I know that if I had a decent server I would have enjoyed my time here more. The atmosphere is great, the design is fantastic, we loved the kitschy little things like the aprons, uniforms, menus. We ordered a few items to share like the squid and rice cakes, which were yummy but a little sweet and not as spicy as one would expect. Also, the steamed dumplings, which were tasty. Lastly, we had the hotpot with noodles, rice cakes, and fishcakes, which was surely a disappointment. Once again, no heat, and worst of all no broth! This dish was so dry! I didn&#39;t enjoy this at all. But beyond all this, what was really disappointing was the service. I feel like everyone around us had nice, happy service with a smile, the hosts and bussers were so sweet and friendly. Then we get a pretentious, unenthusiastic server. He only cared about upselling the menu and getting us to spend as much as possible, instead of giving us honest suggestions and advice. Well, I have worked in the restaurant industry for 15 years, and I saw right through him. He never smiled, he never said thank you. He did everything begrudgingly as if we were bothering him by just being there. He never checked up on us. He really ruined our experience. I would however give this place another try, there are a bunch of other things on the menu that looked fantastic.	0
**Fabulous Fifties Carhop drive-in	1
It goes without saying that this place is gorgeous. I went on a Tuesday night for dinner and am excited to return for brunch so I can experience the setting with some sunlight.Our service was great, I'm unsure of the servers name but she was very helpful and directed me to a great cocktail(sage, grapefruit) when I couldn't decide between two.The brussels starter was DELICIOUS, I would have been happy eating that by itself. For my entree I had the curry-crusted cauliflower which was ok, not as flavorful as I would have liked/expected from a curry dish.This is definitely a place I will look forward to returning to.PS - I was kind of confused by the entrance, having parked on the street it looked like they had a "secret" door facing the street - wrong, this will put you right in the middle of the restaurant. The real entrance appears to be off the side through a parking lot.	1
Thai Noodle Bowl is awesome! I didn't expect it, but it had so many yummy veggies perfectly cooked in a fabulous creamy peanut sauce. My new favorite dish. The atmosphere is quite cozy, too. Nice place.	0
Very authentic, very kind, very delicious!	1
The food was good. Yes the cheese was amazing, but I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll be back. <br><br>I&#39;ll give Buvette the benefit of the doubt that their service is great most of the time, but the day I went it was pretty bad. Actually it was terrible and offensive. <br>Maybe my server had a terrible day, I don&#39;t know. Whatever it was, it was clear that she was annoyed and acted as if we were stupid when we asked a question. <br>I wouldn&#39;t have been so offended but she didn&#39;t even bother saying what dish she brought out so we had to ask a different server what it was. (It came in a jar and I was expecting fish thus the confusion)<br>Our food came separately (do you expect my friend to stare as I eat?) and she didn&#39;t bother checking how we were doing.. Not even once. <br>Didn&#39;t help that she was sooo attentive to the table behind us.<br>On a more positive note, other servers we flagged down to get the help that my server won&#39;t give were great.	0
Unfortunately this was a rare occasion where Yelp did not serve us well.<br><br>My wife and I ate here tonight and had the worst service ... ever, maybe. <br><br>We showed up at 7:30 and ordered quickly. The appetizers (bluefish pate and meatballs) came quickly and were fine; not &#34;5 star&#34; fine, by any means, but we felt like we were off to a reasonable start. That&#39;s when things started to go south.<br><br>There were only a few other tables at that time, but it took 45 minutes for the entree to come. When it did come, both of our entrees were wrong; my wife and I both ordered pork loin, and they brought us fish.<br><br>The fish, it should be noted, was a tiny portion; somewhere around 1/3 or 1/4 the size of a portion of fish that you&#39;d expect as an entree. <br><br>Fortunately it only took them 15 minutes to bring out our pork entrees. The pork was good, but the portion again was too small. <br><br>We were thinking that since they made us wait 45 minutes, and then served us both the wrong entrees, maybe they&#39;d offer us a free desert.<br><br>Instead, they did not even offer us desert, they brought us the check without even asking if we wanted anything else. Pretty rude.<br><br>But wait, there&#39;s more.<br><br>I look at the check, and they charged us for the fish, which was more expensive than the pork. <br><br>At that point, the server said they would comp the meatball appetizer ($6), to compensate for the $4 overage on the bill. <br><br>Presumably, on the service front, we caught them on the worst night they&#39;ve had since they opened, but, even if the service had been acceptable, I&#39;m baffled by all of the 5 star reviews. We would not have come back, as the food was good, but by no means something to come back for. We live off the Graham Avenue stop, and our local places are better, and with normal portions.	0
Ah the burger, ah its English Muffin, ah your Manhattans... ah Bowery, to get me where the gettin&#39; is good, you do so well. <br><br>This is a solid hang for pre-show drinks if you are headed to the Pantages, or just to catch a late afternoon byte and pint. The food is great and the bartenders know what they are doing. <br><br>No much more to say - go.	1
I really like this place. My friends and I walked in around 2-3am after a night at the club. It is a great place to end the night with some late night goodies.<br><br>The waiter was really helpful and nice, though I suppose the late night shift must be easy to work and explains how he was able to easily accommodate all our needs.<br><br>I had some eggs and bacon and other breakfast goodies. And toast and cream cheese. Deliciousness.<br><br>But yeah, anyways, I&#39;m sitting at the booth and I look up and I see ahead of me Michael Cera.<br><br>At the time I only knew Michael Cera through Arrested Development as the ever awkward George Michael Bluth. This was before Superbad and before he would be propelled into hyper recognition.<br><br>Anyways, I didn&#39;t know his real name, I only knew him as George Michael. So I didn&#39;t bother walking up to him, because really, how annoying must it be to be only known for a character and not your self? So I just gawked from afar as he sat there with his posse and asian girlfriend.<br><br>This place is pretty cool.<br><br>Oh yeah, watch out for the bum outside, he followed us to the parking lot.	1
Food is up and down. <br>Service ranges from the slow to the rude<br>A lot better options in the area	0

Love the ambiance here - the back alley with christmas lights is just so romantic, especially during the winter time with the heat lamps outside.<br><br>I come here often for drinks whenever I&#39;m in jtown. Really love their Japanese beer selection, especially the espresso stout!	1
I am always lookig for good food at a fair price. This is not the place. It is just like the XXX in issaquah. Way to expensive. The food is not bad.	0
Every time we go to pike's place is a must do. 	1
Anything cheese!<br>If your a cheese anything lover, this truck will be your new heaven on wheels.!<br><br>Parked out at Bad Beat Brewing in Henderson, and grabbing few beers some heavy food can be required. Ordering the Loaded Fries and the Mac &amp; Cheese Egg rolls we sat down with curiosity as how this will go down.<br><br>The loaded fries are pretty good with a few surprises but the Mac &amp; Cheese egg rolls were amazing! The sauce that came with them which I think is a home made recipe was a great complement.<br><br>Although I didn&#39;t get to sample the menu, everyone who I spoke to love the different items they got and some when back for seconds. Very easy to see why this truck is booked out for the next few months.<br><br>Your also able to book this business for parties and special events, but book ahead they are slammed.<br><br>Overall<br>Food: 4-5<br>Service: 4-5<br>Cleanliness: 3-5<br>Coming back: Yes	1
The only thing to worry about is whether your hot food was successfully reheated all the way through. Everything's delicious especially the drinks.	1
The food was good. The portions for the spare rib looks small but is surprisingly filling. If you're there for dinner have the brussel sprouts, best ones you'll ever have the pleasure of enjoying. Also half off bottles of wine of Tuesday!!	1
We dine at Stripers quite frequently, and it is still difficult to choose what to eat, because there are so many good choices.  The menu has both small and large plates, with an entire section devoted to Maine's signature food, lobster.  The service is always good, and the valet parking is so helpful during the busy seasons.	1
Horrible!! Waiter was good and food was delicious but the Host/Asst.Manager Nicholas Carmona was RUDE! He came up to US and blamed US for another party having to wait!! We still understood and agreed to leave after we got our tab but he continued to antagonize us and be nasty to us. As we walked out, he threatened us!! I&#39;ve NEVER experienced anything like that! Its a shame b/c the food is delicious. But the Host/Assistant Manager was RUDE and unprofessional!	0
it is wonderful to have another great bay street restaurant to go to that is close by. and the weekday pre fixe menu is finally here. and what a great concept. $19.20 pre fixe goes with the 1920 theme. we started with and enjoyed the shrimp &amp; sausage in a spicy scampi sauce over toast points and prosciutto&amp; fresh mozzarella risotto cake with a roasted pepper pesto. entrees pork medallions with hot cherry peppers in a port wine sauce and sesame crusted salmon were equally delicious. to top it off the creme brulee was perfectly crunchy &amp; creamy. chez ettore	1
Large, hip looking space but sadly, the food is bland and falls short of expectations. :(<br><br>The few times I&#39;ve been in there it&#39;s almost completely empty; I wouldn&#39;t go back.	0
It&#39;s a cool late night spot to hangout &amp; chill with friends but that&#39;s it. I wouldn&#39;t go back there for the pizza or anything else on the menu. I tried really hard to like this place &amp; went back several times because it was the only place that stayed open super late by my boyfriend&#39;s apartment other than Denny&#39;s. <br><br>The menu has nothing special disappointed with my meatball sub, my cheese bread &amp; garlic rolls. The last time I went I ordered a pizza to go, when I got home I found it was still RAW dough in the center of my pizza. They only baked it half way....so I finally had to stop giving this place a chance &amp; I cringe every time I drive by Steven&#39;s because I have flashbacks of uncooked pizza dough covered in sauce .	0
Great view, brussels sprouts, and they made my arnold palmer the right way (separated)!Really helpful staff. I've had some uppity screwheads and bitchmonkey waitstaff so far in LA, and this place looked like it could be right up there with the snootiest of them... but they were kind and mostly attentive. Could have used an extra check-in overall, but it was a suuuuper busy night so I don't blame them.Good people-watching too.I'll be back, Perch, don't change a thing! :)	1

You can never go wrong with Flanigans! This location&#39;s layout is great and employees are all really nice. The bar is quick and attentive. <br><br>Only negative thing to say is that they close way too early! ** Everyone can always count on Flanigans being open late!! **	1
&#34;geriatric-esque&#34; lol. True, but you can bring your own party to the table!!<br><br>I stumbled into here, as I ABSOLUTELY had to watch the playoffs (I don&#39;t get TNT) - call it serendipity. Ended up, they cook my favorite grub, kabobs &amp; monster breakfasts (served till 5PM right on your door-step, i.e. delivery). It was delightful.<br><br>So, needless to say, I am very happy, considering I live next door at PLB (No Park La Brea) haha. The bartenders are extremely warm, friendly &amp; not-to-mention generous ;-)<br><br>Parting shot - Try the lamb burgers. Unique &amp; really satisfying.	1
The king of four star reviews returns once again to hand out another four star special. There are a few unique things about this little hole in the wall. The first is that it may be some of the better Chinese food in Vegas. Although that says more about the poor quality of Chinese in Vegas than about how good Oasis is. Two trips to China have ruined me on Chinese food in the states. When a street cart vendor working the streets of Beijing can hand you better Chinese for than anything you have ever tasted in your life, you&#39;ve been tainted to any future Chinamerica food forever. However, I was yet to find any Chinese food in Vegas I liked even before I took my trips to China. Another unique thing about Oasis is that it serves Thai food, but the owners are obviously Chinese (Cantonese I thinks). Usually Chinese places in Vegas are run by Thai with a few Chinese dishes on the menu. Here it&#39;s the other way around. <br>I had the Mai Fun noodles which used fresh veggies and had a good flavor. My constant companion, who I will refer to as Sancheta Panza to my Don Q, ordered the Orange Chicken and we were both pleasantly surprised. The Chicken had a lite, fresh flovar. The sauce was not overly sweet or syrupy thick. I got the impression that the chicken was cut and breaded right before it was fried up. The fried rice was nothing special, very functional, no flair or flavor beyond rice that had been fried. <br>Here is what I can say best about it, if I lived near The Oasis is would eat there a couple of times a week. I get the impression that a lot of people do. Sancheta and I dined in and as we were there we witnessed a steady stream of people come in to get orders to go. The lovely, and especially doting older Chinese lady running the place knew most of the customers by name as they knew her by name as well. That&#39;s a pretty good clientele report. I can&#39;t give this place less than a B as for a little hole in the wall Chinese place it&#39;s pretty darn good. For Vegas it&#39;s really good. For China...meh.	1
Love this place, indoors or outdoors, love happy hour, bar area seems like I'm back in the Caribbean, servers are the best in Vegas....	1
I went for my birthday with 6 of my closest friends. The food was a bit pricey but everything was fresh and delicious.  I ordered the mango martini which was very sweet and the perfect drink for celebrating my 22nd birthday. The restaurant itself was beautiful and well decorated. My friends loved the vibe. I will definitely be back.	1
The oyster po boy was delicious!	1
This restaurant is located on the strip with optional indoor or outdoor dinning. Food was very good, good size portions and reasonably priced. Save room for the wonderful desserts.	1
Ordinary. But served in nice bowls? Nah, they still give you the break apart throw away chop sticks. I should have read the other reviews on other things to try. But being a ramen lover, I needed to order the basic ramen, shrimp tempura ramen in this case, with an add of the spicy miso, which leaves you wondering why it cost extra when it isn't too spicy. At least with most pho places you get a free bottle of sriracha for the table. Oh well. It's not like this place is horrible, hence my rating, it's just not anything I'd recommend to you. The broth is okay, the ramen itself could be a bit more firm, and the appetizers were what you'd expect.I would come back here for the happy hour special though. Deals look good and their tall beers are really tall. (dunno where I stand with that)	0
I went when they first opened and ordered fish n chips to go. Very simple, hard to mess up. It's like the grilled cheese of the seafood world! Next time I'll probably just order a side of fries and not even bother. The fish wasn't very well cooked and I could tell by the batter being undone. The fries are thin and crispy so I'm a fan. I give two stars because the cashier was actually a doll and the chefs were actually friendly. Might've been because I was like their first actual customer at this location.	0
Porteno is a small neighborhood restaurant with lovely ambiance -- its bar comprises half the space, and the entirety of the restaurant is a combination of urban/new construction and old-word European photography. Very comfortable and cozy.<br><br>Dinner at Porteno comprised sweet potato soup, a mixed green salad with chicken and a variety of fresh, seasonal veggies, empanadas (a selection of mushroom, beef and spinach) and filet mignon. Of those items, I tried everything but the soup -- and everything was great. On a semi-side note, the ingredients and the cooking were both extremely fresh, healthy and not overly saturated, buttered or masked. Anyone who says healthy cooking and tasty cooking are mutual exclusives should pay a visit to Porteno.<br><br>The service was great -- the owner attends to each of the five or ten tables set up in the dining area and is not only personable but friendly, down to earth and very nearly Johnny-On-The-Spot.<br><br>Finally, the bill was completely reasonable given the food and alcohol we consumed. So in a purely clinical sense, Porteno is a winner and we&#39;ll return.<br><br>HOWEVER...having said all that, the Thursday night we visited saw the arrival of a dozen or so 20-somethings (age, and also, perhaps, IQ) that seemed to be hard of hearing. Unfortunately, given that the diners were not hard of hearing, it was difficult if not impossible to soak in and enjoy the ambiance and the remainder of the experience without wondering why no one went over to the one or two people at the bar feeling the need to scream every 90 or so seconds.<br><br>We&#39;ll return, but we&#39;ll be bringing duct tape and ear plugs. Or a wish list for the management, which will include: better sound-absorbing materials (perhaps some fabric or carpet lining the walls or the floor) and perhaps acoustic tile for the ceiling, and a willingness to advise obnoxiously loud patrons to have their hearing checked before they&#39;re taken by ambulance to the nearest trauma ward.<br><br>Overall, a wonderful experience that we&#39;ll happily try again; hopefully a Monday- or Tuesday-night dinner will be far quieter and far more pleasant. Bottom line: if we lived in this neighborhood we&#39;d be returning with regularity. Even though we don&#39;t, however, we will certainly be back.	1
All you need to remember is to say &#34;Don&#39;t you guys have a Facebook discount or something?&#34; and next thing you know - your whole meal is half price. SCORE! <br><br>We shared a gnocchi and they even split it on two different places which is always nice. I will say, the whole dish (even put together) was a bit small and could have had more to it but it was absolutely delicious. Luckily we had a pizza to continue eating and devour and it was deeeeeelicious. Great place. Good music. Friendliest waitress.	1
Went here again the other night, and again, I was sober. And again, I did not care for the atmosphere. The service was very slow too. I&#39;ll give it another shot! Maybe not later than 10 PM!	0
Went last night for the first time and loved it! Our waitress Stephanie was amazing. I wasn't sure what to expect from all the mixed reviews I read about food and service. The lobster pop tarts were delicious. We of course got the Marie Antoinette dessert. The cake that came with the cotton candy dish tasted pretty sweet lady jane status...nothing special. But I give 5 stars because waitstaff was super attentive and the food was not as bad as the reviews lead me to believe. The extravagant arrangements were a fun experience. I do however suggest making reservations before 8. The good service may have been due to the fact that the younger crowd wasn't there yet.	1
Treated two friends to dinner for restaurant week. We had a great dinner and our waiter, Kevin, was wonderful. He suggested a delicious Cabernet that was a tremendous pair with my ribeye. The bar at the Capital Grille is probably one of the best in Baltimore. The bartenders are attentive and excellent at thei craft. Overall, the Capital Grille remains one of my favorite restaurants.	0
Now that I have had repeat excellent experiences at BLT Steak, I had the opportunity to take one of my most picky, opinionated and oldest friends out to dinner 02/22/15. My dear friend Paul has experienced most of the great steak houses. Paul was enjoying each phase of the meal but when he tasted his steak, he made the identical phrase not once, not twice but four times ... This the best steak I have ever tasted. I had the pleasure of tasting his bone-in New York and it was fantastic. I still love my Veal Chop but I could easily have the NY as well. Our service was excellent as expected. If you decide to go, say Hi to Casey and tell her David sent you!	1
This place should be shut down. The service is mediocre and the food is disgusting and overpriced. The restroom is tagged and filthy. There are far better places in Downtown. This place is an embarrassment to Los Angeles.	0
Terrible customer service. Plenty of people should be replaced. Somehow I was convinced to return a second time, and the service was still bad. The food was whatever - definitely not worth &#34;bothering&#34; the staff for. They seemed upset for some unknown reason. I felt like I was dropped in the middle of a bad marriage, and I was the husband home late from work - No greetings, no smiles, nothing but a cold plate of food.	0

Went here for Dine LA. Arrived early for our reservation. The place was mostly empty. Was told we would have to wait. Waitress finally came and said sorry about the wait &#34;but it&#39;s Dine LA.&#34; (??) There was barely anyone else there! For some reason the menu on the Dine LA site gave the impression that there was a vegetarian entree. Not the case. The &#34;ravioli&#34; on the site turns out to be short ribs with ravioli or something. My friend had to order off the full price regular menu. (Note they appear to have fixed this now).<br><br>I ordered off the Dine LA menu. <br>1st Course: Mesclun Greens - Pretty good. Can&#39;t really go wrong here.<br><br>2nd Course: Hawaiian Ahi Steak - Bleh. I am not a picky eater, really. However, I ended up not finishing it and thinking about it afterward made me kind of nauseous. I think that it may have been prepared ahead of time and then microwaved? It was room temperature at best and rubbery. I had to saw at it with the steak knife that was provided. I thought the seasoning was good and it probably would have been a LOT better if it were hot. (You may ask why I didn&#39;t tell the waitress. That was another issue. It was very hard to find her or get her attention. She kept disappearing into the back and then would appear once in a while and swoop by real fast. She seemed extremely stressed about the huge crowd I guess they were expecting for Dine LA).<br><br>3rd Course: Smores Tort. Bleh again. I like things well cooked, but the marshmallows on top were so black that they looked like licorice. The rest of the tort was ok. Kind of reminded me of one of those easy chocolate pies you can make in the freezer with a pre-made graham cracker crust. Definitely would not pay top dollar for that.<br><br>I also tried my friend&#39;s fries (parmesan and truffle oil). They were the best thing that I ate there, but I wouldn&#39;t make a special trip for them.<br><br>The final annoyance was that the tables are lined up along the wall and they are not spaced far enough apart. So when a party came to occupy the table behind me, I ended up with a chair shoved against the back of my chair for the remainder of the meal.<br><br>Maybe this place is fun for happy hour, but not for a nice dinner. Won&#39;t be returning.	0
Bonsai:<br><br>Had not been to your 8th street location, used to frequent the coral gables establishment which is now closed. Uggh! Was not pleased at all! Place was swanky and inviting but that&#39;s about it! We ordered hot saki and it came watered down. We ask proceeded to tell our waiter about the disappointing saki and he suggested we buy the $23 bottle. As for the sushi, not the freshest tasting. I ordered a $14 roll that was not worth the price in taste or quality. And to make matters worse, we were asked to quickly finish up and leave because there was another party waiting! What is that? I hadn&#39;t even finished my disgusting saki yet! Not recommending this place to anyone.	0
Surf and turf was great same with the twice baked potato and grilled asparagus..... 1 of the top 3 dining experiences, if not the best, I've ever had . I CANNOT WAIT TO GET BACK!!!!	1
I literally ate another dinner after eating here and spending $16. Food was tasty, staff was nice, but first order of business is to, you know, feed your customers.	0
Gross!	0
Portion is way too small ! Even the dessert not worth it !	0
We were anticipating a lovely meal at Anthony's. We were seated toward the rear of the restaurant, in a beautiful quiet area-a definite plus for conversation. Our server was fantastic!-very amiable and ready for any need we might have had yet gave us space and time. For the price, the food was good but nt especially excellent.We were given a delicious sorbet dessert to end our meal.	1
Took my girlfriend here for Valentine's Day. The place is a very romantic spot with gourmet style cuisine. Make sure you sit on the outside deck where what looks like a large ficus tree is the centerpiece that the deck area is built around. Sitting on the back deck area at night gives the impression that you are in a tropical island somewhere which is very nice. The best part about this place as a date spot is that it is a 15min drive from Griffith observatory. We had the mushroom risotto and scallops for dinner which were very good but the 3 scallops you get won't fill you up so make sure you fill your belly with some drinks or an appetizer. Overall a good date spot or special occasion spot but for normal going out its probably a little too pricey for me. Valet $5	1
finally made it out for 15 dollar monday supper and was so so happy. I've been waiting to come come on a night they don't serve pork..and this was the night. A really simple, tasty bruschetta, a crispy polenta with shrimp and calarami--reallllllllly yummy, and the creamiest gelato i've ever had w fresh fruit (they ran out of the original dessert on the menu). A lively setting, great friendly staff, and awesome friends= a truly lovely night at little dom's :-)	1
Yep I&#39;m bumping them up a star. The service was way better this time and the papa rellenas were awesome!	1
Come to Canter&#39;s if you want a great pastrami or corned beef sandwich! I don&#39;t live near this deli by any means but when I&#39;m in the area and in the mood for a good sandwich, I make my way over to Canter&#39;s. I&#39;ve had both the pastrami and the corned beef sandwiches and haven&#39;t been disappointed! At $12, it might seem pricy but they stack the finely sliced meat nice and high in between two slices of fresh rye bread and offer a side of cole slaw or potato salad. During my most recent visit to Canter&#39;s, I couldn&#39;t decide between the pastrami and the corned beef sandwich so I opted for the Canter&#39;s Fairfax sandwich which stacks corned beef on top of delicious pastrami. Once again, I wasn&#39;t disappointed. We got some pastries on our way out and picked up a big black &amp; white cookie, a few chocolate macaroons, and an apple strudel. I liked all of them! They were made fresh and weren&#39;t too sweet.<br><br>My overall experience was great. The restaurant is old fashioned with a relaxed atmosphere. The service is efficient and our waitress was very nice. Parking in the designated lot next to the deli is free up to an hour and a half, just don&#39;t forget to get your ticket validated inside. It&#39;s also open 24hrs so that&#39;s pretty great!	1
Love the outdoor seating, and almost always a go-to if I&#39;m meeting up for a drink in DTLA.	1
I have been here a few times and its a real treat. The food is excellent and the three story plexiglass wine locker, complete with wine stewards hanging on trapezes inside is a spectacle. The price is worth the overall experience, and with wine from $100 up to $10,0000 a bottle you need love the stuff. Overall it's fine dining at its best!	1
Let me start by saying that I&#39;ve never really been a fan of this place: gargantuan off-putting serving sizes, mostly subpar food (except for the Cheesecake, of course) and bizarre Egyptian Art Deco-y unidentifiable themed decor. But, the last time I went there really took the cake (or should I say, &#34;cheesecake&#34; buh dum tiss) for terrible experiences. <br><br>I ordered the Evely&#39;s Favorite Pasta, which tasted kind of sour and wasn&#39;t very good but I was starving, so didn&#39;t complain. <br><br>Two of my friends had the Fettucini Alfredo... big mistake.<br><br>We leave, and go along our merry way to hang out at a lounge. About an hour into our fun girl&#39;s night out, my friend runs to the bathroom and gets sick. Mind you, we didn&#39;t drink and we hadn&#39;t eaten for hours before going to cheesecake. <br><br>About two hours after that, we decide to head back to my place and head our separate ways. My other friend who had the Alfredo, says she feels fine, says good bye and gets into her car. As soon as she turns on the car, she swings open the car door and yacks violently all over my driveway. Coincidence? I think not! <br><br>The next day, we call to complain. Well, that didn&#39;t work out initially. The manager who I spoke with was extremely dismissive. He had the audacity to tell me, &#34;Well, we make all of our sauces for each plate from scratch, it&#39;s not like they&#39;re sitting there in one batch.&#34; Really? Really guy? You&#39;re going to tell me that you people make sauces from SCRATCH for each individual order you get on a very busy Friday night and yet manage to take only 10 minutes to get it to your customer? You must think I had a botched lobotomy, or something. Even if you did in fact, make each sauce individually, it doesn&#39;t negate from the fact that the ingredients may not have been fresh. I highly doubt it was pure coincidence that both of my friends got sick from the same exact dish when they hadn&#39;t eaten anything but that in several hours. <br><br>Luckily, we called later that day and the second manager was extremely professional and apologetic. He gave us the information to report the incident to corporate. <br><br>Moral of the story: Stay away the Fettucini Alfredo!	0
The reign of the decadent and pretentious burger ends right here. The bowery burger&#39;s honesty and perfect simplicity is the key to escaping the debilitating nightmare of sweet, tacky, overly dressed grease bombs. You will awake feeling humbled, impressed, satisfied and addicted.	1
what happens when you get the 'Chef' from the Olive Garden and team up with an Army Cook?you get this place. eating here made me crave Army Food with Olive Garden Bread Sticks and a piece of hospitaliano.is that even a word?ugh.	0
Not sure why I havn&#39;t stopped by this place before! Yes the staff is amazingly nice and helpful and also geared towards being green. My food to go was wrapped in deli paper instead of wastful styrofoam. Tomato soup was delicious and the Speck sandwich was strong in all the right flavors. I&#39;m happy.	1
This post is purely on service because the seating system is ridiculous. I called ahead to see how long the wait was and the host told me about 30 minutes. My friends and I decided we could wait out 30 minutes for some good food, but when we arrived he told us 45 minutes and didn&#39;t even bother to take our name down. There was a large empty table by the door so we decided to sit there, but then we were asked to wait outside in the blazing south florida sun for 45 minutes. After 15 minutes or so I decided to check if he accounted for us and put our name down somewhere when I overheard a party of four complaining about how they were told to wait 30 minutes and now it&#39;s almost an hour. After hearing that, I promptly turned around and left. Beware, this place is not a walk in friendly place!	0
Incredible! One of the best meals I have ever had!! Spicy curry with perfect rice. I give it six stars!	1
I really like this place. I came for happy hour on a Sun night. I had no problem finding 2 seats at the communal table. They have great happy hours offerings: all pizzas are $4 off. Most of the pizzas are normally about $10-$11 so for $5 what a deal! We ordered 2 pizzas: bianco &amp; the &#39;shroom. I thought both were delicious. The onions were caramelized on the &#39;shroom...so good! <br><br>They have an open kitchen so you can watch them make your pizza which is great. <br><br>Excellent service. The guys working were super friendly &amp; attentive.	1
I love taking out of town guests to Canter&#39;s. No one expects any place in LA to be comfy or to have any sort of history. I&#39;m from the midwest, where we love us some comfy greasy spoons. In fact, we REFUSE to eat anywhere unless 1) there&#39;s a few coats of bacon grease evaporate on all visible vinyl surfaces and 2) all waitstaff are women over 40.<br><br>The pastrami and corned beef here are fantastic, piled mega high, and served with your choice of no less than 5 different kinds of mustard if you ask for it.

When I slurp it, I can imagine how Link feels in Lengend of Zelda when the fairy is filling up his heart life meter.

Never had a chance to eat there because the guy with the handlebar mustache was a complete jerk. <br><br>All I did was ask a reasonable question and he gave me an obnoxious answer for no reason.<br><br>Yo moron, you&#39;ve got a service job. If you hate your life, keep it to yourself.	0
For the LA experience, please visit The Apple Pan. It reminds you of the 1960&#39;s. I LOVE the 1960&#39;s - it&#39;s my favorite period in American history. So many things happened during the &#39;60s <br><br>Apple Pan is different from other restaurants because you sit at a U-shaped counter on stools. You have to eat fast. They don&#39;t like people who linger around wondering what they should order. Look at the menu before you get there, so you can order right away. Love it!~ Food type: burger and fries.	1
We had reservations at the Beach Cafe at 5:30 p.m. When we arrived, the restaurant did not appear to be busy! While there were more guests seated outside on the patio, only three tables was occupied in the inside dining area. There was only a couple with no reservations ahead of us and my daughter and I, waiting to be seated. Because we had reservations, we were seated immediately. The waiter did not take long to welcome us, gave us the menus, and took our drink order. Meanwhile, less than five minutes later, the couple that was in line ahead of us were seated, and then three more parties within the next 5 minutes thereafter. It took my daughter and me about 15 minutes to decide what we wanted and to give our order to our server. I had the	0
I must admit I was a bit disappointed:<br>-lackluster service<br>-wanted us to sit by the entrance on a FREEZING night<br>-small portions (both on the dinner servings and the wine pours)<br><br> I could go on and on, but I&#39;ll just leave it at this -- we were still hungry after leaving that we drove to Grimaldi&#39;s and chowed on Pizza to satiate the hunger.	0
This is the fourth time my family have been to dinner and each time the food has been wonderful however tonight we had a horrible experience We asked for the wine list and the waitress told us it was in the process of being updated but she could recommend a Lebonese wine that is their best seller You can imagine our shock when we got our bill and the wine was $75.00 We thought it was a mistake called her over and no mistake it was our mistake for not asking up front how much it was but I feel we were scammed because everything else is so reasonable and she told us it was their best seller unfortunately we will never go back!!!!!	0
I came 15 minutes before Apple Pan opened on a Sunday morning, and before I knew it, the group blew up to 20 a minute before the doors were unlocked. Just madness, but I knew it&#39;d be worth it, and it was.<br><br>If it&#39;s going to be your first time, I definitely advise that you save room for dessert. You can&#39;t go wrong with the steak burger (the apple relish/chutney is devine), fries (they&#39;re standard fare, but very hot and fresh) and a soda (comes out in a classy cone and holder). For dessert, banana cream is definitely the way to go. If you&#39;re feeling more classic, then apple pie with ice cream is absolutely delicious and satiating. <br><br>You will walk out of Apple Pan stuffed beyond belief, but happy as a beaver who just chewed on some old growth. The classy joint continues to rock, and your best bet is to come in the morning on a given day if you want to avoid the crowd.	1
Have been several times but I'm left unimpressed with their beer. Food is just ok, but the poutine is killer!	0
We were with a large group at multiple tables so I cannot see how this would be different from a normally busy night. Once our orders were taken we waited just short of an eternity for the food to arrive which when it did was cold and the orders were wrong. By the time my wife got her food everyone else at the table was finished. To pay $12+ for a below average hamburger and cold fries is insulting. The waitress was apologetic saying that there was a new cook in the kitchen and they were short-handed. I won't be returning.	0
Ive been here so often I never check in. Good homemade food at a cheap price. The place is tiny. Just a lunch counter with stools. Like Thursday the best for their corned beef and cabbage.	1
Was completely happy with this choice.	1
I live in the Park La Brea area which is very close to Canter's which i drive by constantly, so I had been wanting to go there for a late night 4th meal. I was not impressed. I got the matzo ball soup which was so basic. It was literally broth and one matzo ball. Usually when you order matzo ball soup it comes with carrots, celery, noodles.... I also had a tuna melt which was good- it hit the spot for a 4th meal. The service was nothing exceptional, you could tell our waitress could care less about our table. Overall, I would not come back.... if i want a late night deli experience, I'd go to Jerry's Famous Deli- it might be a tad bit more expensive but i enjoy their food more than Canter's. However, their pastries and desserts looked amazing, so maybe I'd go back to try their baked goods.	0
NIU is a small charming restaurant in el<br>Downtown.<br>The service is very good as well as the<br>Spanish/ Catalan food.<br>We had the whole fish, the tomato appetizer,<br>The lobster w/avocado and a delicias desert<br>That was like gelato.<br>The wine and ambiente were also excellent.<br>make reservations if you can this spot is Super Popular!!!	1
Watch out Japanese sushi restaurants and Szechuan Chinese restaurants, you have a formidable new rival and VIP serves up both, really, really well.	0
This was my first time here and my last. From the moment the bouncer ID&#39;d my BF. He was annoying. My friend wrote a review below and all is extremely accurate. The only thing is I don&#39;t regret telling the bouncer he was being extremely over bearing and that we were not in a club so he should BACK OFF!. I didn&#39;t call him a name. But, i was very stern with him and asked him to stop harassing paying customers. I also mentioned I complained about his behavior to mgmt. Which I did and to be honest i truly believe that the bouncer&#39;s behavior was because of the Mgr request. So 2 were playing at this game.<br><br>The bouncer most definitely over reacted by my words of truth and would not let me in again. I had my CC at the bar. All i wanted to do was get it and close my tab. Which turned into him grabbing me forcefully and pushing me out. I called 911 got my CC back with nothing charged on it (the least they can do).<br><br>As big as this bouncer was i felt sad for him. I wasn&#39;t afraid of him in anyway. The fact that he took what i said and made it into a big deal was sad. Especially since all NYC bouncers adore me. It was as if i was talking to challenged person. He deserved to hear it and just MAYBE this 5&#39;2&#34; lady speaking up and standing up to these guys can help other patrons wanting to spend a nice ngt out drinking without being harassed a chance to enjoy themselve.<br><br>Peace and love	0
I went there one Friday evening with two others expecting awesome service and dinner. We all ordered and our food was ready, then they started swiping our credit cards and none of them will work. 3 people multiple cards each, total of 10 or so cards and all got declined. Never happened to us before and our cards had just worked earlier. No help from any staff either, they were rude and I had to go next door to get cash to pay for our meal by which time our food was cold. They could have apologized, checked their system, let us eat and then we would have paid, or at least offer to reheat our food. Will never go back again...	0
The waitress was nice... <br><br>We had the fried bread with sauce as an appetizer, that was all right<br><br>I ordered a burger that has the deep fried bread as well. It was so overwhelming I couldn&#39;t finish half of it. <br><br>Will not go back.. stomach still hurting..	0
I&#39;m an avid bruncher and love trying new places. Especially those with a great view and outdoor seating. Perch did not disappoint! My sister had two eggs, potatoes and bacon. I had the huevos rancheros which also came with potatoes. I have to say those were some of the most delicious bfast potatoes I&#39;ve ever had! They had the most amazing crunch but were so moist and soft on the inside. Both our dishes were great.. We also shared the french toast which were to die for. We also enjoyed some cocktails. My sister had the sangria and loved it. I beyond fell in love with the French Maid. I&#39;d go back just for that drink! I&#39;ve never had a cognac cocktail before but my gosh, it was delicious. perfectly balanced.	1
The food was fantastic and reasonably priced for Las Vegas. The wine list was great and the service was top notch.	1
Last time we were here was &#34;6/21/2007&#34;. <br><br>Since there I never had the desire to visit this place. Last night we did cos we were in the neighborhood. Brought some friends here as well.<br><br>Oh my...such horrible ramen. The broth is so blend, the pork slices were dry and hard. Had the pork cutlet combo too. Where are the flavors???<br><br>What happened to you Daikokuya? Opened too many locations and quality goes down? <br><br>Not returning ever. Stupid me.	0
Just had dinner, the service was ok as well as the food, we had the bouillabaisse and it was like a campbell tomato soup with everything they could find in the kitchen, the grouper was the best dish.<br>For desert we order the chocolate mousse ok, the apple tart was horrible heated up in the microwave made everything soggy o and the homemade vanilla ice cream was actually a milkshake you could eat it with a straw.	0
So good!!! Every course was delicious, tasting very fresh and homemade. Wines were great, too. Staff was very attentive and pleasant. They&#39;ve only been open about 3 weeks, and the place was packed! It is much more an Italian restaurant than just a wine bar, and we loved everything about it! Reasonably priced, as well. A new Italian favorite for sure!	1
Stopped in on my way home from work. Service was great, everyone very friendly. Had a glass of wine, the banaganoush and tumeric fried rice with chicken. I thought the chicken was maybe a tad overcooked but it was still delicious. Dishes are made to share but on my own those two filled me up. I will look forward to a return trip to check out the dining room.	1
Hello, My overall experience was very nice, we all had a great dinner and time. I gave low ratings for service because even though the waiter was very friendly he would not be seen for a while waiting for refills/cocktails. Before dinner I let him know about the free appetizer email that you guys nicely sent me. We all got our dinner but no appetizer. Asked another server for him to find out what happened..he later said he remembers now that we requested that but that he had forgotten. We got the appetizer (for dessert) 20 mins after dinner.  I know that it was the weekend but just felt a little left out.  That was all, thank you for your understanding.	1
I don&#39;t know exactly how it happened, but sometime between this joint opening and today, Diablo [Urban Taco Fabricator] became the nexus around which my social life revolves. Friends/relatives in town? I&#39;ll take &#39;em to Diablo. Bored, and it&#39;s a Friday night? Let&#39;s go to Diablo. Boozey brunch? Checkarooney. <br><br>The bison chili tacos are great, the churros to die for, and I&#39;ve never had a friend be disappointed by the beers on tap. (Me? I stick to the cider on draft, Anthem cherry. Crisp, just tart enough to wipe away the bad memories of Angry Orchard&#39;s syruppy hell. Have one, and then have another one.)<br><br>But the real reason my friends and I continue to go to Diablo on a pretty regular basis is the service and the vibe. In this way, Diablo plugs a gaping hole in the Silverlake strip -- somewhere that&#39;s both low-key enough to have a decent conversation and dinner, but happening enough that a night out actually feels like a night out. On top of that, the servers are amazing.<br><br>This is my Cheers bar. This is where I take my friends, my new coworkers, my mother, my roommate. Can&#39;t recommend it highly enough.	1
This place was soooo cozy and the decor was really fun, I love it :) also the latte I got was really good, and a small came in a huge tall glass. My only complaint is that it was ridiculously hot inside except for a couple fans. Other than that I loved studying here; the wifi was super fast and the ambiance was super chill in a different way, unlike the typical starbucks coffee shop.	1
I absolutely loved the ambiance at Perch. The staff was very friendly. The truffle fries were amazing. i had the braised beef short ribs over polenta and the flavors were really good but as i ate more of the short ribs the majority of it was fat! after eating that bite i couldn't eat any more although the polenta that the short ribs were on was the best i've ever had. so overall i'd love to come back to try more dishes and this time be able to hang out at the rooftop bar as it was closed when we went due to the rain. oh and the band (went on a friday night) added the perfect touch to the ambiance. definitely coming back :)	1
Meh.... A few issues. Server was nice but service wasn't great. Had too many tables, didn't stop by very frequently, never checked on the food. On the surface they had a few decent vegetarian options (it's Silver Lake folks!), but the dressing or sauce had anchovies thrown in (is that really necessary?). And no, they could not modify pasta dishes or make a vegetarian pasta dish (there was one on the menu but not to the liking of the rest at the table). The food I was able to have was decent but not spectacular. The veggie platter (with anchovy dipping sauce of course!) was pretty good. The farro salad (with feta) tasted like bad macaroni salad (way to heavy and gooey), the soup (cauliflower?, can't remember) was really tasty but way too salty (and I love salt!). The meat eaters with us liked their food, and the selection, but they didn't love their food. And charging for lousy filtered water, which the waiter never mentioned to us, is a bit ridiculous! Had a lot of hope for this restaurant as I've heard so much, but this first experience was below average on many fronts. At $50/head, that's not acceptable. Won't be going back.	0
as always braddahs quality is consistent from location to location &amp; we love that!! the food is always so fresh &amp; healthy options, who doesn&#39;t want healthy these days...guilt free eating. the employees are so helpful, even the owner is hands on &amp; makes sure everything about your visit is the best it can be!! pass that coconut bark this way! thx braddahs :]	1
Great little sit in/take out place on grand ave. The food is fresh and well priced. Good variety of food. My favorite is the Cuban torta. It is huge and filled with all sorts of good stuff. Their sit in area is a bit small, but kept clean. One issue I have had is small errors on orders through grubhub, a missing topping for example. Delivery service can be slow on occasion. Overall one of my favorite grubhub choices.	1
I never really liked kyochon too much until I found out how bomb their honey wings were. The garlic wings are pretty good but their spicy wings are way too spicy for me even with the side of pickled radish. I always order for take out and it usually takes 10-20 minutes depending on how busy they are.	1
Great for something fresh. I had the quinoa salad and a kale salad. The kale was perfect as is, The quinoa could have been better if the veggies weren&#39;t chopped up into teeny tiny little bits or there should have been more of them. Otherwise, it was delightful.<br><br>And the service was sweet and thoughtful! Good people.	1
The bf and I had a rare date night and decided to give this place a try as we were new to the area. The food was ok. We ordered 4 things: The trio of dips, the Hangar Steak, The Dumplings, and the Cheesy fries. <br><br>The tastiest thing was the trio of dips. The other items were somewhat meh. Not great. The Hangar steak was over- cooked and so were the dumplings (aka potstickers). Don&#39;t bother with the cheesy fries. <br><br>We also both ordered the Basil Smash Cocktail, which is made with Bourbon and basil and sounded delicious, however it was super sweet and not to my taste. Someone who prefers sweeter drinks may love it however.<br><br>Our service was great and the atmosphere was cute and good for a date spot. However, for the price and the quality of food I would pass and go somewhere else.	0
Excellent food and fast service! Definitely stop here!	1
Average ramen. Average Nabeyaki. There's lots better in this city.The reason for my two star rating is because we were presented with our check and asked to pay halfway through our meal because the restaurant was closing. Nevermind this is bad service to begin with, but the server just set the check down, said they would closing and not very politely asked us to pay. 75% of the tables in the restaurant were still eating and had checks dropped right as 9:00pm arrived.Servers...I understand you probably have some place you'd rather be. Mr. Manager, I assume that you have to count cash, reconcile credit card receipts...but this is not acceptable in a sit down restaurant. This is the service business and incredibly bad service to do this.If the food had been amazingly awesome, I might think about going back, but after this...nope.	0
So glad to see La Boulange finally open it's doors in LA! The architecture and interior design is outstanding and you can really see the love put into the details. Board formed concrete bars, hand crafted butcher block tabletops, reclaimed bakery paddles on the walls, mason jar lighting installations, and all the while, it's still simplistically beautiful. And lucky for us Angelenos, there is dedicated *free* parking in the back, just for La Boulange. The food was, as expected, delicious. Amazing pastries, scrumptious breads, and delectable coffee's and tea's. The burger was a first and was great! I'll be back to try to full extent of the menu over time!The only issue preventing me from giving 5 Stars at the moment was the service. Don't get me wrong, the staff were incredibly kind and helpful, but overall they were a little slower than expected. Granted they have only been open for 2 days now, I'm sure that speed of service will improve shortly, and I can/will update my review accordingly. Also terribly disappointed that the Caesar Salad was missing from the menu. A standard item that we were really looking forward to from our experience in the SF locations. And yes, for those who still don't know, La Boulange is a Starbucks owned company now (purchased in 2012) - but that's not a bad thing! Although now owned by Starbucks, the 15 year old bakery and Bay Area staple is still run by its original founder Pascal Rigo, who is now also the SVP of Bakery within Starbucks. That *truly* means the same quality and passion that La Boulange has been serving up for over a decade will remain. That being said.. and as always.. Haters gonna hate .	1
Very good food. Main downer was LOUD and RUDE large table of men (lawyers) what a relief when they finally left	0
A pleasant surprise find. We were roaming around Bushwick on New Year&#39;s day. We were told that Roberta&#39;s had a 2 hour wait, so we looked for some burger place that was closed for the holiday. We were heading back to the subway to go back to the city when we saw the green neon lights of Foresst Point.<br><br>We decided to check it out and couldn&#39;t have been happier with the decision. The tuna tartare tacos were super good, the $7 burger is one of the best deals I&#39;ve ever run into at a bar, the clams were bomb, and the ricotta doughnuts with lemon curd were one of the tastier desserts I&#39;ve had in a while. Plenty of seating, no wait. Overall, an excellent, excellent experience.	1
One of the three rooftop of Downtown.Great view, great ambiance, it's cosy. However there is not so much seating accommodation.	1
Great experience. Great breakfast burrito. Will definitely go back or more.	1
REALLY good sandwiches and fresh ingredients. I ordered mine with wheat bread and it was surprisingly fresh and delicious. Only downside is that he ran out of tomatoes by the time we got there, but he hooked us up with free cheese because of the inconvenience. The swiss cheese is super soft and fresh, which you can&#39;t really find too many places. Also, you MUST MUST MUST try their mustard vinaigrette that they give on the side.... heavenly. Really great customer service and delicious sandwiches.... what more could you ask for?	1
I had Calle Tacos cater a bachelorette party for 20 girls back in June. My contract included a delivery fee and service charge, and I also took out some cash to add on top of that. When the delivery person showed up to our hotel, he called me and asked if I was going to come downstairs to the lobby and &#34;get all this stuff&#34; because it was &#34;a lot to carry&#34;. I said no. I was in heels and a dress, not to mention I paid for DELIVERY. He came up and unloaded all the food on the floor inside our door - sauces spilling out everywhere and lids falling off the beans, but for whatever reason, I tipped him extra anyway.<br><br>Then we discovered the worst part of all: no utensils, napkins, paper plates or any way to eat our food other than like cavemen. This catering had been booked months in advance and the catering coordinator I worked with knew that we were having a bachelorette party at a hotel. My order was not cheap and it is absolutely customary for delivery to at least include forks and napkins! I had 20 girls staring at big bowls of rice and beans and no way to eat any of it. Maybe it was my fault for assuming the tools would be included, but when I called the coordinator to get it resolved, I got no answer. I called and texted several times and never heard back from her - not even the next day. When I later emailed to voice my disappointment, she apologized for the misunderstanding and offered to mail me a gift certificate to use at the restaurant. Well, it&#39;s November and I still haven&#39;t gotten it. I won&#39;t be holding my breath. <br><br>If you&#39;re thinking about using this company for catering, I&#39;d choose elsewhere!	0
I went here and it was great. It was llke the standard hotel downtown but less people. the salads are small but great and drinks are great. It was free entry as long as you get a drink the night i went. however i don&#39;t know if it is always like that it is so nice i would be surprised if they didn&#39;t charge sometimes.	1
When I go to a coffee shop, my minimum expectation is that the coffee will be good. I ordered a Peruvian and was expecting the light citrus flavor with a nutty undertone of a freshly roasted bean. I got a burnt cigarette flavor of improperly cleaned coffee maker.	0
We were looking for a place to get a burger last night and this place came up on my yelp app. It's near our house and seemed like an easy choice. We split the "The Six" burger with blue cheese, onions, and a brioche bun with upgraded truffle fries. It was really delicious! We happened to go on a Thursday night and they run a $6 glass of wine special so we both had our favorite types of red that went really well with the burger. We also ordered a side of mac and cheese which was just ok. Not floored by it but would skip ordering it the next time. After dinner we couldn't decide between desserts and since we did share an entree we decided to get two desserts. I had the beignets with creme fraiche and homemade chocolate sauce and he had homemade dulche de leche ice cream. They both were amazing!The bill totaled at around $65 with tax and tip. A bit expensive for a random dinner but the food was really fresh, flavorful and delicious. If you're looking for a swanky environment this place is pretty cool as well. Nice rustic wood table in the center, really cool vintage looking light bulb chandeliers. A nice restaurant for West LA and the staff was extremely nice and helpful!	1
So if you Delorean is on the blink and the skies are clear, the easiest way to travel back in time is to ride your machine to the Apple Pan. <br><br>Sure, the service can be a surly, but if you ended up serving patrons since 1947, you would be a little surly too and for me, there is something charming about a waiter stating the obvious. <br><br>Patron: Um, do you have Fanta? <br>&#34;Waiter&#34;: Do you see it on the menu? <br><br>OK, some of you might just get butt-hurt over this, however for me, I found it funny. Like, damn, wish I could say that at work ! <br><br>and the food is solid ! This is a diner, expect solid diner affair. I personally really like the Tuna Sandwich, fries and a Fanta, um, I mean Coke. <br><br>Expect a wait is what I will close with.	1
Way Better than Daikokuya and no line...nuff said	1
ah Sunday brunch back in Madison. I was really excited to try this place but I think I got slightly disappointed. First of all, not enough parking! Probably a total of 16 stalls in the tiny one way parking lot.. so do plan on car pooling here. I circled around the street 2 times before finding a parking space on the side street about 3 blocks away. It might just be Sunday though.. who knows. I do think the building and decor is kinda cool.. felt like a good old diner with a retro kick. so here comes the food part.. I ordered corn beef hash.. food was lukewarm. I usually like my hot food hot.. not like somewhere between hot and cold. It was greasy too. not a fan. I did like the side fruits that came with it..def gave my greasy hash a little break. I think I would come try their dessert next time. The pie and bakery goods look more yummy.. until next time. Oh btw our waiter was really friendly and unobtrusive so if you are the type of person into good table service.	1
Lovely three course meal on Valentine's Day. The lobster bisque was almost perfect, just a tad cool. The truffle supplement was worth every penny, too. We had a fabulous view of the harbor while we ate, and the service was attentive and warm--without pretense. Amazing wine list.	0
Hi.I am compelled to write. My aunt, cousin, brother and I went to Canter's on January 27th. My aunt had fond memories of the place from her childhood and requested it on a road trip through LA. I imagine none of us will go back.The food is greasy, but I expected that. What I didn't anticipate was actually getting ill. We all got sick from the food. Serious vomiting. NASTY. I lost a couple of days recovering. So did the rest of my family. I feel awful about this. The place is so dirty. We also waited an eternity for the food. The waitress seemed high. For example, she added a glass to our table every time one of us asked for more water. It looked like 14 people ate instead of 4.And as for the pastries, skip them. They are nothing like the ones I grew up eating in delis in and around NYC. They are very "Hollywood." They look good, but lack taste. Tip: the rugalach in the bakery at the Mayfair on Franklin Blvd are amazing.Skip this joint, for real. Yes, even if you are hammered and nothing else is open. They need to clean it up.	0
I am 25 and I love hatties. Not a fan of their sweet potato fries but their poutine and meatloaf is great. The happy hour is the best as well!	1
I just starting really enjoy going to Panera Breads. I was originally not a fan of their food but thanks to my co workers, I really like dropping by for a nice lunch.	0
I&#39;ve been here twice. If not for the sign outside, I would have never found the place. If not for the coaxing of friends, I&#39;m not sure I would have gone in. That alley looks sketch, just saying.<br><br>I really like the set-up of this place, though. The bar itself is inside with a few tables, but the majority of the seating is outside in the alley. There&#39;s multiple rows of white lights strung across overhead, and plenty of heaters for when it get&#39;s oh so chilly in LA. <br><br>First time I was here, it was for Happy Hour. Cocktails were $2 off and burgers were all $5 (fries were at an additional cost, I believe). The burgers are delicious. So juicy and well cooked. And for five bucks you seriously can&#39;t go wrong. I think the burger special only runs certain days of the week so you might want to check on that. Cocktails were unique, bit weak. Most were around $10, pretty standard. <br><br>I also came here on a Thursday night. The place was crowded but not overly so and it wasn&#39;t difficult to find a place to sit. We ordered the wasabi fries (which were just okay). Normal fries with a wasabi dipping sauce. And the teriyaki sliders with a mango salsa. The sliders were (again) great. I guess they&#39;re just good at burgers? The teriyaki sauce and mango salsa were great together as well. Three for $7. Not a bad price. Drinks are also reasonably priced (if not on the cheap side). Beers ran around $6. I ordered a whiskey ginger for $7. My only complaint was that we waited forever for the sliders. When we flagged down our waitress to check on them, she reported that they had already been delivered. Apparently to the wrong table. Great. So she put in the order again and they came out pretty quick after that, but an apology would have been nice. Otherwise the service was okay. Though it always seemed like the waitress was around when we didn&#39;t need her and disappeared when we needed her.	1
My girlfriend and I came for breakfast and were seated promptly. It took a while for the waitress to come over with waters, but it was busy and she had tables with food coming out. Once she did come over, she was extremely nice and asked if we wanted anything to drink. We got some coffees and ordered a donut to share. They have 3 types (glazed, sprinkles and cinnamon-sugar) and we got the glazed donut. It was delicious and well worth it. For breakfast we ordered the corned beef hash which was pretty good, although I wish the potatoes were a little burnt. My girlfriend got eggs morney, which she enjoyed. When the waitress brought our check she also found a coupon for a free donut and coffee which we appreciated greatly. Altogether, the food was good (and there were plenty of menu items that I wanted to try) and at a great price (nice food to dollar ratio in both quantity and quality). The servers were friendly and thoughtful and we will be returning again.	1
Very good place to eat in LA. It's fame has true reason.I came here with some friend's after attending the annual Johnny Ramone tribute at Hollywood Forever and had never been here before. Well, the spots it had on the Travel Channel were very correct when they praised it. I had their famous pastrami/corned beef and it was unbelievably good. Plain and simple.Even the pickles you get on the side somehow stand out amongst the world of relatively normal pickled cucumber spears. Kosher truly has a new place in my heart(No, that was not a clogged artery joke, but I digress). I ended my visit by stopping at their wall of baked goods, purchasing a slice of their cheesecake while I was at it to take home with me. The next day when I had it, I found Nirvana. And it wasn't the Washington based grungy kind either, but the rich and creamy kind dipped in udder glory.Ok, now to be human for a change. The only things to not enjoy about the place is:1.) The noise level. It's a bit noisy, but maybe only if you were me and were sitting next to an unknown music producer who had a flock of desperate woman with him, laughing at every little joke he would make, regardless of it truly being funny or even without a single hint of successful timing to them as if they were Ray Liotta in "Goodfellas" kissing Joe Pesci's ass via his trademark hyena cackle.2.) The price. But you gotta spend money to get what's worth the money, so deal with it and you'll be in jewish heaven. If that's a thing...	1
The Far Bar is one of those places that you don't want to Yelp about because you don't want anyone to know about it. But the secret's out so I might as well vouch for it. I've been coming to The Far Bar since I moved to LA. This is like "Cheers" for me. It's a casual bar with an amazing whiskey selection and great bar food. My faves are the wasabi fries and tuna tartare tacos. Come early to get a good spot as it does get crowded especially during happy hour or weekends. The clientele can get a little weird sometimes but at least there are different rooms to choose from.	1
Just ordinary gyoza I could get in a chinese or japanese restaurant for less than $10, which they served at $14.99. The seafood gyoza ones doesn&#39;t even have shrimp. They basically raised the entire menu by $1-$3 since they opened in a few weeks. The pork belly ramen is at $24.99 now. Not happy with the food we paid at this price!	0
I have NEVER been more disappointed in a restaurant in my life. I went to Sea Salt and Pepper yesterday with a group of ten people for a birthday party. Not only were we forced to reserve at 6 PM but once we had been seated and enjoy ourselves, their staff started to rush us. We had sat down, ordered a bottle of champagne, some appetizers, and were making decisions for our wine order when the waiter came and told us that he had been told that if we didn&#39;t order dinner within the next few minutes, we would be asked to leave. I have never felt more disrespected in my life. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. I will never go back.	0
Weak at best.... their sides were good and desserts as well, but jeeeez, these people need to find a cook! I ate with 7 people last weekend; all 7 of our burgers were burnt on the outside, and bloody red on the inside. I understand that the quality of meat used is high and rare meat is considered to be &#34;good&#34; meat, but I don&#39;t want to feel like I&#39;m eating an undercooked steak when I&#39;m eating a burger. It was honestly gross... anyone who prefers a medium to medium well burger, don&#39;t get near this place.	0
I&#39;m generally a fan of Morgan&#39;s, but their brunch was a big miss. I guess it&#39;s my own fault for assuming brunch would be...brunch and not family-style BBQ. I was a little surprised when their breakfast hash was that - a paper dish with brisket and potato. My wife did much better ordering the burrito, which was an actual meal and not a pile of meat. It would make a little more sense if family-style items and actual breakfast items were separated on the menu, but these guys were both in the same list of brunch entrees on the brunch menu.<br><br>The big red flag we ignored was that they don&#39;t serve coffee. I guess in Texas they drink Coke with breakfast?<br><br>They do a great job with lunch and dinner, but brunch was a mistake.	0
I like the old style atmosphere here. I tried a piece of the coconut cream pie (I don't even like coconut) and thought it was incredible. Definitely try the pies here at the very least.	1
Carpaccio di tonno appetizer was delicious but the Caesar salad was nothing special. Both the seafood pasta in saffron cream sauce and the cioppino were outstanding.	0
THE BEST hidden gem in Hollywood. We love to come and sit and eat at the bar because the bartenders are amazing (Jordan, Nathan, and Avery). Tonight we ordered the hanger steak and it melted in our mouths. It's the best spot in the area and has won our hearts, it will win yours. Go for a date, go with a group go solo, just go. Everything from the house-crafted cocktails to the management to the ambiance... you won't be disappointed. Half of me doesn't want to tell you how good it is so that we can still get a spot at the bar...	1
I always hear a lot of good things about Umami burger so my boyfriend and I decided to check it out. We couldn't find any parking so we decided to pay $4 for valet, but upon arriving, the place was pretty empty. Our server was really nice and recommended a couple burgers to us. He told us the manager was strict on substitutions, so while we could take things away from each burger, we couldn't add anything- okay. We opted for the truffle burger and "manly" burger and got fries and onion rings. The burgers were delicious, the bun was nice and soft and it accompanied the flavor of the meat and ingredients well. We both liked our burgers, even though they were a little on the small side - I probably could've eaten 2. The fries and onion rings were just okay, I definitely wouldn't spend $8 on them again. Overall, it was an alright experience. The friendly and quick service earned them another star. I don't know if I would come here again, as it is a little pricy for what it is, but I'm definitely glad I got to try this place out.	1
I really don&#39;t think that line is worth it. We came during happy hour when there was no line. Excellent food menu, but the fries (soggy mess) and bruschetta are not good. Mediocre at best. Sitting outside is nice, but the novelty is not worth the wait and it doesn&#39;t make up for bad food.	0
This restaurant is quite terrible to its taste in atmosphere and I will never return to this place and general.	0
Nice place. Looking at it from the outside you wouldn&#39;t know but it is decorated super cute. They have a nice bar, the food is great. I love the ropa vieja. Nice spot for a date night or a ladies night.	1
Went here recently with friends for my 2nd visit. I joined them about an hour into their meal and that was no problem for our waitress. She was very sweet and attentive and obviously liked her job. 	1
One of my Seattle Faves! I used to go here all the time and watch the Two Fifths on any given Tuesday night in the lounge. Those were the days my friend! We thought they'd never end, we'd sing and dance forever and a day.	0
Guys, do not waste your time standing in line for this. Pizza is ordinary. Service is atrocious. People are rude. And it is EXORBIDANTLY pricey. Do not validate bad food and worse behavior. Spend your hard earned money on something to be proud of.	0
I had "Wexler's plate of pork" which happened to be something completely different than I had 3 months ago. This time, I was disappointed - not that it was not good, but last time, the food was outstanding, this time just usual matter you can get elsewhere.	0
I loved Risotteria Melotti. It is adorable, amazing ambience, delicious and surprising delicious, and the friendliest staff. I wanted to visit the restaurant since it is 100% percent gluten free. My boyfriend and I brought our own bottle of wine, which they happily served us. The staff was so friendly and I felt like I was a guest in the home of an Italian family, not at just another restaurant. We had a fresh salad and the risotto that is infused with fig and wrapped in prosciutto. We were sharing both dishes and they split up both into separate bowls without us even asking.<br><br>I will definitely be back.	1
The food was nicely presented but pretty boring in taste and  tiny portion. They had a good assortment of good wines, a bit too pricy. Nice view.	0
The double stuffed fried Oreos will hit the spot. Don&#39;t let all their fatty looking food pics fool you into thinking that&#39;s all they have. I ordered a chicken chop with salad and guac and wasn&#39;t disappointed. They have a &#34;healthy&#34; and &#34;paleo&#34; menu for more conscious minded eaters. <br><br>Prices are fair, and there are TVs inside if you&#39;re looking for a laid back place to have some good eats. I&#39;ll be going back again!	1
good food and definitely had enough space...did not appreciate how we had to wait 10 minutes even with a reservations and the restaurant not being completely full...we were then put directly next to the door (and it was cold too) which I was not happy about.	0
I've been here several times to eat. The dirty fries are mind-blowing and all the sauces are great too. Oreo concrete was perhaps the best thing I've ever tasted... They took a St. Louis classic and jazzed it up. Love. I agree, though, that the beef could be a little better seasoned. But everything else was sooo good that I can imagine that that's the way it's intended to be.	1
don&#39;t try ordering takeout from here -- 15 minutes just to get someone on the phone.	0
Steak Brazil is a fun way to enjoy delicious Brazilian food at a reasonable cost. Take a trip into authentic Brazilian style serving of the juiciest and richest meats imaginable. The kind waiters and clean environment help customers focus directly on their food. When here, order their all you can eat steak and salad bar. If appropriate age, the Caipirinha Mojito styled beverage is A MUST. If you&#39;re looking for a wonderful dining experience, check out this Brazilian style diner.	1
A whole new perspective (literally and figuratively) on the LA Scene. Views were amazing, giving the most beautiful sunset sight in a long time. Hip, sexy and friendly people. Went on a Friday night, got a cabana and celebrated a birthday. Very accommodating staff ;-) I recommend the dark & stormy mule ;-) delicious!	1
One word: salty! The ham on the Eggs Benedict was chewy &amp; my index finger was hurting from cutting the English Muffin.	0
I grew up right down the street from Cliff&#39;s Edge and can&#39;t believe I never realized it was there! It&#39;s sort of nestled behind the 99c store, and easy to miss if you aren&#39;t looking for it. <br><br>Ambiance = 5 stars <br>Food = somewhere between 2 1/2 to 3 stars <br><br>Cliff&#39;s Edge is the sweetest, cutest little restaurant with an endearing patio constructed around a large, charmingly old tree. Candles, lanterns, heaters, rustic mirrors and wordly cushions adorn the deck and surround the tables (which are a tad close together if you are weird about that sort of thing). <br><br>The service is pretty outstanding. The hostess was so charming and friendly, and our waitress was super cool! Overall it was really pleasant experience at Cliff&#39;s Edge, and the scenery and vibe of the restaurant is worth it to try at least once. I will say, however, that the food was not all that impressive. It seems the norm for expensive, trendy places to serve underwhelming, upscale dishes. It is pretty pricey for dinner and so you would expect the caliber of food to be on par with a 4 star restaurant of similar pricing. At Cliff&#39;s Edge, you are really paying for the ambiance. I had a pleasant experience here, but for the price, I might not come back unless it&#39;s just to drink a couple bottles of wine by the lovely tree.	1
Don&#39;t eat here. They&#39;ve got my order wrong or forgotten something literally everytime I&#39;ve eaten here. Once or twice I completely understand but I&#39;m talking about ten times. Obviously don&#39;t care about the customer.	0
The best place to take a break at the LACMA museum.<br>Food and service are good.<br>Enjoy the ambience and the place.	1
Perfect place for great service and disgusting food. I had the chocolate chip pancakes...gross! No flavor and made with poor ingredients. And the syrup was imitation syrup , i think it was Aunt Jemima . Basically if you want to pay $10 for food that cost them .50 cents to make, Canter's is the place to go!	0
The burger I had was okay - the meat was great. Bun was stiff and not good. Fries are great. 	0
best fries ever. california burger is good. good portions.	1
I went here today for brunch. Free mimosas for ladies - not too bad. I also went two nights prior for dinner with a bunch of friends, and had a great salad and fine customer service.<br><br>Unfortunately, during brunch, they don&#39;t allow any changes to their menu, so when I asked for arugula in my salad instead of romaine, the waiter came back from the kitchen and said the kitchen staff refused to put arugula in the salad even though it was sitting right in front of him. I even agreed to pay extra, but no, they didn&#39;t want to change the lettuce.<br><br>It&#39;s also extremely loud for brunch and the food isn&#39;t generally good enough to keep me comin back.<br><br>This place is alright, but if you have dietary restrictions or just want some friggen arugula instead of romaine, don&#39;t come here.	0
Little Doms, you are wonderful. You just about gave me a heart attack with that meatball sandwich, but I forgive you. Thanks for putting up with our party ordering what seemed to be 500 bottles of Prosecco and being so friendly. Everything I tried was amazing. Even the lox pizza, which I was a bit iffy on but man, it was good. I'd be there all the time if I lived there.	1
2.5 stars for BRUNCH on Sunday.Not sure if it is an on going thing- but had Brunch here on Sunday- I think most people (including us) came here wanting ramen and were surprised they didn't offer Ramen at noon on Sunday!Menu was limited- you could choose from either smoked salmon or eggplant. You get a bento-esque meal:- half an eggplant with sauce (kinda reminded me of oyster sauce) on top. - miso soup (yum!)- a root plant (or squash?) type of plant with sauce on top- yummy.- packaged seaweed and bowl of rice.Nothing special... would have liked to see them offer Ramen as an alternative to the limited brunch.We also got the quail egg... which was a raw quail egg on top of some beans(?). Consistency was thick and after a few bites, I wanted no more.We also found a hair in our rice :(The service however was friendly.	0
My lady and I enjoy dinner after a matinee at the Smith Center. After the play Joseph and the Technicolor Dream Coat, we decided to walk over to Cleo's for a small plate dinner. What an epicurean delight. We chose multiple small plates of which each was better than the last. Be it a vegetarian, fish or meat choice they were all delectable and led to a fine full feeling so that the walk home was truly needed. Our dinner was so good, we are going back for an after theater dinner after the next Broadway show.	1
I've always heard of Canter's and their supposed great reviews. I saw Larry David dine there on Curb Your Enthusiasm but after my experience I rather feast on on a dirty baby diaper, No Joke. I was forced to dine here as it was my friend's birthday wish to try a pastrami sandwich. After growing up on Johnnie's Pastrami's I don't think anything can compare to a mediocre chuckle of a sandwich. My friend listened to our other friend who is of the Jewish persuasion. Maybe in the old days when many Deli's did not exist this provided a great atmosphere for the stars.... The place was empty so how could the service suck? Canter's is over rated and I hope to never torment my stomach again! The only reason I gave it two stars is because their Black and White Cookie was decent enough to boost their rating.	0
Wow... Wow... Louis our server was the bomb. What a great, delicious, and cuddly bistro. A little loud, but really wonderful! Totally worth it. I had spinach dip and eggs and croissant french toast. Super good! I think they make their jelly in house...	1
I&#39;d been here a few times before, and always had to wait for a table, so I was prepared for that. What I wasn&#39;t prepared for was being handed menus, bread, and water, then left to sit for 20+ minutes while everyone who was seated after us was served. It was to the point that these tables had food brought out before anyone even considered taking our order. Being excited to introduce my boyfriend to a restaurant I had enjoyed immensely in the past, I was trying to stick it out, but I couldn&#39;t get the attention of the waiter (owner?), so I politely asked the busser if it would be possible to order, thinking he would tell him we were ready. Instead, he went over and talked to another table for a few minutes, and we still weren&#39;t acknowledged. We ended up just walking out and picking a different restaurant in the neighborhood. I honestly don&#39;t even know why we waited as long as we did to leave. Never again.	0
I went here for the first time last night and I will never be back.<br><br>The service my party and I received was the worst I&#39;ve ever had. It was my friend&#39;s birthday and we show up to the bar. The man seated at the first desk and I struck up a conversation - very friendly. Go up the elevator to be greeted by a bouncer named Lorenzo, who proceeded to give my group, but mainly the birthday girl, the dirtiest looks.<br><br>He ignores us for a couple of minutes as he is opening elevators for leaving customers and checking IDs of new ones, but refuses to acknowledge us. He then proceeds to say the birthday girl is too drunk and cannot come inside. With that, denied the rest of us from coming inside at well. This was ironic because many drunk-er people were definitely being let in and out of that bar as we stood there for 5 minutes.<br><br>As we are waiting for the elevator to come back up so we can politely leave this bar and this awfully rude bouncer, he said some very inappropriate things to my party as he set on his perch in the corner and my group was nowhere near him, just trying to catch an elevator.<br><br>He then proceeds to call Mario, the security guard. I&#39;m sorry, but I am 5&#39;1&#34; and completely sober, why does a security guard need to come get my group when we are literally standing by the elevator trying to go back down.<br><br>By the grace of God, our elevator opens up and we get crammed into an elevator with very drunk people who are also outraged by our situation, and we finally start making our way out of the bar.<br><br>But of course, one last negative encounter has to happen with the kind man sitting downstairs who refused to acknowledge us on the way out.<br><br>Never have I felt so disrespected and I will definitely not be coming back. You lost 4 customers tonight.	0
Excellent customer service! Outstanding food selection. Very clean and well maintained. If you&#39;re looking for a great place to eat, with quality food, friendly vibe, and lots of love and soul, I&#39;d highly recommend Dulan&#39;s. Special thanks to their courteous staff for the warm welcome and personal attention.<br><br>Warm regards,<br><br>Cassandra	1
In LOVE with Perch. Their brunch is fantastic and their dinner is fantastic. If you're not worried about your waist line absolutely get the parmesan truffle fries! Tuna Tarte Tarte & the scallops are delish too!	1
Worst &#34;peruvian&#34; ceviche I&#39;ve ever had. I explained to the waiter that peruvian ceviche does not have parsley. Peruvian ceviche is made with cilantro and he kept argueing with me doubting what I was saying. Needless to say that i became non-existant to him for the rest of our meal. My friend had the organic chicken which was undercooked and bleeding on one side, returned it and came back the same. Horrible experience. Will never come back.	0
Positive: Woody, pretty interior.Negative: Reuben is not really a Reuben. A few slices of turkey meat, a smear of mustard and a mild imprint of sauerkraut. No REALLY. Not trying to be picky or mean or in a grumpy mood. Do not eat the Reuben, please. Tried a few other items here; nachos, eggs, pretty bland. It's such a pretty place, I want to like something here. Maybe a good place to come after a movie or play and get a piece of pie and an espresso or glass of wine? Maybe, next time.	0
I don&#39;t know what happened to this place, but I used to go here twice a week, and now, every time I try to give it a 2nd chance, its totally disappointing on a basic cooking level. First time I went for a simple burger, and it was disgusting, and I couldn&#39;t finish it. 2nd time, I got a piece of fish that was just annihilated. Tuna steaks shouldn&#39;t be well done like a dried out little brick with no seasoning. It&#39;s a shame to destroy a nice piece of fish like that. Fennel crusted was a big time overstatement, it should be called, fennel sprinkled, or the &#34;fennel shortage 2014 Tuna special&#34;. I&#39;ve had this exact dish months ago and it was amazing. Even my fries were dried out and overcooked, like, &#34;double the cook time, i forgot I was cooking that&#34; level dried out. What&#39;s going on over here? Did the entire kitchen staff get replaced? Get it together, I want to be friends again.	0
I&#39;m really happy this place exists, in a pretty dead area for gathering spaces. Love it! <br>however, a couple suggestions: <br><br>1. We&#39;ve ordered cheese/meat plate a few times - on both busy and not so busy nights. Each time took around 40 min to get our stuff. I asked the owner if they&#39;d consider pre-cutting the cheese/meat and he said it would affect the quality. They don&#39;t open til 5. If they even did that an hour before they opened, it would be ok and save everyone a lot of time! Because of the time I probably wouldn&#39;t order food again. Just ends up getting frustrating. <br><br>2. Wish their wine was cheaper during happy hour because I can get $5/6 wine at lots of bars in Manhattan. I&#39;m only saying this because we don&#39;t order one or 2, we order several glasses. Anyway...<br><br>Otherwise great place!	1
Food here is decent, but you might not receive everything you ordered. I specifically ordered a dish that come with plantains because I had a major craving, but did not receive any. When I raised the issue with the server and pointed out the dish description, he told me that the menus were all wrong. Since that was the case, it should have been explained when our order was placed. And really? Is it really that difficult to cross some things out with a pen/marker? Why should it become my problem that your business&#39;s menus are inaccurate?	0
Stumbled on this place when I stupidly got off the D train at 50th Street instead of Bay 50th Street (oops!) and stumbled around a bit, got some heat stroke, and then figured out I was absolutely, without a doubt in the wrong place...But hey the pork Banh Mi I had were awesome (yum yum, lots of nuts, fresh cilantro, delicious pork...and hotness!!) and they had a much better selection of choices than some of the Chinatown spots I&#39;m used to.<br><br>If I&#39;m ever in Sunset Park again by mistake, I&#39;m definitely stopping here.	1
Each bite of my truffle burger is like a piece of heaven! Waiter was attentive and personable. Ambience is better than the one compared to Hollywood location.However, not having a full bar was let down, only beer or wine with my burger, opted for red wine ;)	1
came here and had the California burger. It was great along with the fries. The burger looks small but dont let it fool you it is very filling. Parking was easy to find and cool shops on the same block. Cant wait till i go back. 4 Stars for the price	1
We came here this evening. We had the Island breeze with soy milk. It was pretty tasty and not too sweet. A good amount for the price. We also had a Wheatgrass shot. Those are never great, but the orange slice was very good after. <br><br>Really friendly service and a nice clean place. <br><br>Overall pretty good. A lot of food to try next time.	1
I took out of town business colleagues there after a long day. The food was faboulous. Our waiter was wonderful. He made great recommendations for wine pairings for our meal.	1
The arugula salad was perfect-fresh, with a light lemon vinaigrette which will not disappoint. Our waiter was very attentive. Even offering to brings sample of their 2 draft beers to help in my choice. A top notch dining experience.	1
I wish we could give "zero" stars! I started going to OA when it opened and have had many enjoyable encounters with the food and staff. Today marked the last time I will ever set foot in this sad sad joint. Sat down around 2:00 pm and had to wait some time to give our order - that's not a biggy. Our youngish waiter finally took the time to take our order. Two tables were seated after us - they were served their food and were eating. Our food -who knows where it was. We had to re-feed the meter. The food arrived. I ordered the hamburger steak medium rare - made a point of saying that twice, with two eggs over easy. I cannot believe how over cooked the hamburger was, inedible. I guess that is what took so long for our food to arrive -that alone would have take twenty minutes. The home fries actually had blackened burnt parts. The eggs were cooked over easy -really over easy the eggs were basically raw. The toast was soggy, I am hoping that was from way too much butter, My partners food had obviously sat under a heat lamp while my burger was being burnt.When I told the waiter I would pay for the two eggs and toast but not the rest he was obliging and took my entire breakfast off the check. However it would have been better to offer to have my breakfast remade ... oh well. It does make me sad that this destination is off my Castro map of restaurants.	0
This place is just so beautiful, I felt like I was on vacation in another country when I stepped inside. Five stars just for the atmosphere itself.	1
This is strictly a review for takeout/delivery.<br><br>Consistently great pizza. Delicious sauce.<br><br>Soups are great too.<br><br>Delivery takes a little longer than to be desired, but that just shows how popular they are. <br><br>I look forward to eating in the restaurant soon.	1
Want to Mad Men yourself? Go to Stark Bar.Stark has transformed an otherwise empty outdoor area of LACMA into a refined, modern drinking experience. Don't worry if it's chilly outside -- plenty of heatlamps keep the area nice and toasty.Extensive cocktail, beer and wine list, though go for the cocktails. On my recent (and first) visit I had Smokey and the Bandit: 10 year old Laphroaig whiskey with honey, orange and lemon. The citrus was a nice complement to the real smokiness of the drink. Really enjoyed it.Some good small bites here -- olives, cheese plate, yellowtail -- but the flatbreads look particularly delicious. Each one I saw came out smoking, piping hot. The service was a little spotty, especially considering there were 10+ of us. That said, I highly recommend it!	1
The evening started out amazing. They were very welcoming and friendly.  We had some special requests and they were very accommodating. The meal was excellent.  However, even though  our waiter knew we had show tickets, once dessert was served he disappeared for over 45 min. After requesting assistance from at least two other staff persons, our waiter finally re-appeared and 10 min. later brought us our bills.  Unfortunately, when our bills finally came they were all wrong and had to be corrected twice.  We ended up being 15 min late for our show with no apology and no apparent concern from our waiter or host.	1
Some of the reviews on this place are pretty funny. I guess it is all in perspective. Look, if you are going to the Churchill to have a fine dining experience with snooty servers and a fancy wine cellar, forget it. If, however, you are looking to have a great tasting, medium-priced, good times adventure, then this is your place. Every time I've been here I have had a wonderful experience. Sometimes they will mess up an order (rare), sometimes they are way overcrowded, sometimes things take a little while, but any time something isn't up to par they are MORE then gracious and make up for the inconvenience 10 fold. Go in with a good attitude and you'll be surprised at how good this place is.	1
Great outdoor seating, nice vibe but a bit like Germany in its exclusionary flow. The food was cheap and good. Best chile cheese fries that I&#39;ve eaten in a bit.	1
Good beer, decent food but waaaay overpriced. Seriously $12 for a sausage on a plate of sauerkraut? Someone behind the scenes here is a little greedy. Went there last night with my buddy hoping to get a couple beers and sandwiches and it seems that after 5 this place just sells salads, sausages and entrees hovering around the $20 mark. We got a burger, a sausage, one beer each and the bill was $50. Two stars for the good tasting beer and the friendly service but sadly this place is just a ripofff.	0
Most of my Indonesian friends were ranting and raving about bail cafe so i finally decided to try them out..well to tell you the truth what really made me come over here was because i seen a picture of the dessert drinks =x I ordered the baked chicken and my cousin ordered the eel and we shared a homemade dessert drink. Thumbs down for the main dishes but I liked the home made dessert drink although it cost the same as my dinner ($8.00). Maybe next time I will have the guts to try the durian fruit dessert ;)	0
Very friendly staff, parmesan fries rocked the drinks were off the chain and the ambiance was spectacular . We were. Visiting the area and our waitress was great at telling us were to go. I loved this place and would recommend it to everyone.	1
What a fantastic place! I got the Little Gem Lettuces and the Scallops. Yum, yum, yum! Of course the view is AMAZING. Make a reservation and enjoy : ) I recommend putting away your phone (after a few pictures of the view!) and soaking in the beauty that is Perch!	1
We went last night and were excited to try what comes up as 89% satisfied on Urban Spoon. 	0
Executive summary: Average food with more than above average prices. A disappointing lunch for two was 85 dollars (no alcohol). <br><br>Deviled eggs - very nice texture on the white of the egg but the yoke filling was rather bland. The egg itself was of high quality that&#39;s for sure. <br><br>Smoked brisket sandwich - flavorless. The meat was rather fatty and the bun was somewhat soggy by the time it arrived to the table. <br><br>Crunchy Yardbird sandwich - arrived cold and rubber-like texture. I had to send this one back and the replacement at least came out hot but the quality of the chicken just wasn&#39;t there. Dark meat with a nearly flavorless breading overly deep fried. <br><br>You should be seeing a pattern by now; flavorless food. <br><br>Arnold Palmer to drink...supposedly this is the Arnold Palmer of champions, with lemon infused ice cubes. Well, it was a decent Arnold Palmer, if you like tons of sugar added (I don&#39;t), but the lemon infused ice cubes were nowhere to be found. <br><br>Smoked chocolate coffee cake with coffee ice cream. Unfortunately this was the highlight of the meal, and I had no intention going in to have dessert. The coffee cake came out as a full loaf hot and fresh from the oven but only a very small scoop of ice cream to accompany it. <br><br>Service was pretty good. Received a visit from two managers and the chef...no doubt because of the send-back of their signature sandwich. <br><br>All in all...a big let down especially when you consider the price paid for substandard food. I dare say (if I actually were to consume fast food) that KFC or a chain BBQ place such as Lucille&#39;s offer better taste and value. This is yet another tourist trap.	0
It was our first time trying this place since our usual Thai spot had a 2 hour wait time. I was impressed with the quick service. However the taste of the food was far from adequate. The shrimp fried rice tasted like it had been burned, the seafood soup had way too much salt, and the pad see ew had too much egg that is covered the whole plate. And the waiters wouldn't hear you unless you were practically yelling. Won't be going back here.	0
I&#39;ll get right to it- I had a fantastic rose wine, the mussels, and the burrata appetizer and everything tasted delicious. The service was swift and friendly, nothing more nothing less yet, everything I could ask for on a Wednesday night post-work outing. The atmosphere was nice, with lots of good energy. I definitely won&#39;t pass up the opportunity to return to The Churchill!	1
Yep. Its another trendy LA burger place. I find this a bit hard to right about b/c after all - its just another burger place and its pretty hard to mess that up. The ordering process is great in its simplicity and the food comes out perfectly enjoyable so definitely worth a trip but certainly nothing to write home about either.	1
Well this place did not live up to all of the hype! I&#39;m from Buffalo but live here in Vegas now and was excited to check this place out. They claim to be a Bills and Sabres bar but sadly that&#39;s not the case. I had friends in from Canada who wanted to watch the Sabres game and I called twice on Monday to make sure they could show the game. The first time I called the girl asked me if the Sabres were a football team! She proceeded to tell me I had to call back the next day and ask the bartender. I had my husband call later that night in hopes of speaking to someone else and getting a definitive answer, after all our friends from out of town were driving all the way from the strip so I wanted to be sure. My husband was told that they would for sure have the game on TV, not on sound (which was fine) but definitely on TV. Fast forward to the next day (Tuesday) we get there along with our friends and guess what?! They didn&#39;t have the game! They said they had the package but they couldn&#39;t get the game! If you have the package you would&#39;ve had the game! I was furious! Then we decide okay well we&#39;ll eat at least since we&#39;re already here. We go to order Loganberry and you guys were out. So then we order a Labatt&#39;s you were out of that too! We walked up to the window and ordered our food, and there was a girl there that had the biggest attitude I&#39;ve ever seen. Everything was annoying to her. At one point I got up and asked her (as she was standing at the bar talking) where the to-go boxes were and with a huge attitude she says &#34;UGH go to window and ask them&#34;. I&#39;ve worked in restaurants before for almost 10 years and I&#39;ve never seen such AWFUL customer service!!! I don&#39;t know how you can claim to be a Buffalo bar and &#34;Home of the Sabres&#34; when your staff didn&#39;t even know who they were and you didn&#39;t show the game! What an embarrassment it was for us in front of our friends from out of town! You claim to carry all these wonderful things from Buffalo except you didn&#39;t have half of it! I was greatly disappointed with our first and only experience!	0
I drove all the way from south Orange County to try this place out since I was in the neighborhood. I got the Original Burger with Bacon of course and a fried egg. It was excellent overall. The burger was cooked medium and just taking the first couple of bites it was obviously made fresh and not frozen at all. The ramen was soft and so were all of the other ingredients. The sauce they use compliments the burger very well. I have yet to try the fries and some of their other snacks. I will be going to this more frequently now that I am sold on this place.	1
Went to this place a few months ago with my husband as saw it on Bay Area Check Please. This place is very dirty, the food is not great and have had better dumplings any where else in SF. They put tons of MSG in their food that it caused me to swell up and my husband as well and we both got sick off the food. Would never go back there as the food sucks, prices aren't cheap, dirty, and not a place I would ever eat again.	0
Food may be good. I never got to try it. I came here alone on a friend&#39;s recommendation and waited for a seat for an hour before I realized that the servers were seating people who had arrived as couples ahead of me, including one couple that just walked up to the door and got seated right away as a table was being cleared. I asked the waitress about it and she said that it&#39;s their policy to only let single people sit at the bar. Which had, like, six stools. All filled with couples. I was so hungry at that point I was about to cry, so I just left. Basically, Cafe Gitane hates single people. Spread the word.	0
Had the groupon and decided to go here for lunch with the girlfriend. Best decision for lunch ever. We came right when it opened so there was no one which was nice and the lady that helped us was very friendly and patient with us as we ordered because we were asking a lot of questions. My girlfriend and I got the carne asada fries, carne asada tacos, carnitas tacos, a shrimp taco, and a taquito. All of the food was very good and was worth way more than I paid for on groupon.	1
We dined at Knife &amp; Tine for the first time last night, making the trek from the South Loop.<br><br>The food was very good, and the service was probably the friendliest I&#39;ve ever had at a restaurant. The deviled eggs were great, my son and I enjoyed the crispy duck a lot. My wife and her friend had a soup and cauliflower risotto - she raved about the soup and cauliflower but thought the risotto was not to her taste. Our other friend had the pork and grits which he liked a lot.<br><br>The waitress brought us tastes of a few wines that were under consideration, which was really nice. We thought we were too full for dessert but Ryan talked us into splitting a brownie, which was delicious. We took a couple of the little pies home and enjoyed them for breakfast this morning - don&#39;t miss out on those!<br><br>We&#39;ll be back!	1
How this place has such great reviews really boggles my mind. Do the people from Las Vegas have a much lower standard for quality? My boyfriend &amp; I came here for breakfast before going to the movies last weekend. There was a large line, which I didn&#39;t mind because I assumed the food would make up for it. I ordered the drunken gypsy toast, which was pretty good, however I had asked for a side of turkey bacon, and they gave me pork bacon, which I do not eat, FORTUNATELY I could tell before taking a bite. My boyfriend ordered the 3 Happy Chicks, which SHOULD have been called the 3 RUNNY Chicks! The eggs were so undercooked they might as well have left them in the shell! There was yolk all over the plate, covering all the other food. In the middle of attempting to eat, I told the staff 1, my drink never came &amp; 2, they have me pork bacon instead of turkey. They brought me my drink, but never my bacon. I asked my boyfriend how his bacon was, he said to salty to even eat. The only good thing about this place is that our dog got a huge goodie bag when we got home.	0
Service was horrible. I came here with my girlfriend and we started with their $20 foie gras entree. It came with tiny little pieces of brioche - not nearly enough to finish the foie gras. We tried to order bread (sold separately), but the waiter didn&#39;t bring it. They finally gave us two more little pieces of brioche (still not enough) and when I complained to the waiter, he said the brioche was very expensive. So is their restaurant, and it&#39;s a rip-off. Go somewhere else.	0
The squid ink lumache pasta with snails, pistachio-parsley pesto and hen of the woods mushrooms is TO DIE FOR. The steak with pickled mustard seeds, Brussels sprouts and olive oil smashed potatoes was also delicious. For appetizers, we ordered the grilled octopus with beef-braised baby carrots and marrow-fried pangrattato and the roasted beet bruschetta with whipped goat cheese and crispy kale. Both were great, though the octopus was a little rubbery. Overall, highly recommended!	1
This was my first visit to Cabo Wabo in Las Vegas and I was pleasantly surprised at how good the food was.  My wife and I ordered two drinks (can't recall what they were) and they were both delicious.  My wife does not like to taste the alcohol in drinks, and her coconut/rum drink was very smooth.  Mine on the other hand made my eyes spin, and that was a good thing.  We ordered the appetizer platter, the chicken tortilla soup and split the lobster enchiladas.  The platter was a nice combination of wings, quesadillas, chicken taquitos and two other items.  Quesadillas were a bit lame, but if you bring kids they will like them.  The soup was the best!  The broth is poured at the table over the chicken.  Nice touch. And the lobster was fresh.	1
So, the truffle burger is to die for....That's all I ever get. Nothing compares. Last time we got some sort of arugala salad to start and that was actually REALLY tasty (it sounded bland on the menu). Also, the service at this particular location was on point for how busy they were (We went on a Friday night).Umami burger is always good, it never disappoints.	1
A friend of mine recommended this place I had never heard of. So I decided to give it a shot as it is relatively close to work. Boy was I impressed. First of all, this is a very tiny place, probably no more than eight tables, so attention is as personal as it gets. Another important thing to mention is THERE IS NO MENU, that&#39;s right, no menu. It is a prix fixe deal, 45 bucks per person for lunch and 90 for dinner. The lunch menu consists of 4 courses and dinner consists of 6. So the owner comes to the table, introduces himself and asks you if there is any food you are allergic to or don&#39;t like, also he will ask you if there is anything in particular you&#39;d like to eat and if you like spicy. Based on all this information, the chef will prepare your dishes. You will absolutely love this place, and it is worth the price, at least for lunch, haven&#39;t tried the dinner experience yet. So get out of the ordinary and treat yourself for a nice custom made meal.	1
Omg! Soooooo yummi! Kokio chicken is the best chicken ever! Made to order!fresh ...crunchy cooked perfectly. Its so juicy and flavorful i love this chicken! There a little pricey but its worth it. I always order a full order of chicken and there curly fries! I never had anything else on the menu lol. Go here its amazing!	1
When I first came to LA it was all about Canter&#39;s: my California friends took me there; I felt at home and welcome there; it was open deep into the night for coffee and Hungarian cheesecake, and there is always a line, a buzz, and the great smell of deli. In other words, Canter&#39;s in a definitive Hollywood experience not to be missed.<br><br>Deli is never cheap, but Canter&#39;s prices are actually a little bit lower than some others. And they have a half a deli sandwich and a bowl of soup special that is very reasonable, delicious, and filling. <br><br>Canter&#39;s is also one of the last places to offer Kishke with gravy, and also Kreploch soup. If you like &#34;old&#34; pickles then that&#39;s the way they serve them. I like new pickles myself but they are hard to get. Also at Canter&#39;s you have to buy a side of the green tomatoes, they are not free as with most other places. <br><br>I love the pastrami here, on rye (nice and chewy), but the corned beef is also great, probably their signature dish. The Matzo ball soup is good but it is not huge. Specialty sandwiches are also tasty like the Danny Thomas or the Marilyn Monroe. Whatever you have I recommend having it with a black cherry soda. It pairs well.<br><br>Other fare include the Mish Mosh soup, a huge bowl of everything starchy (Matzo ball, noodles, Kreploch, chicken meat, and carrots) all in chicken soup. Also hot beef and hot turkey sandwiches with mashed potatoes and gravy. And if you want a full dinner, with appetizers and sides, they have quite a few of these too.<br><br>Don&#39;t miss the excellent home baked pastries and a cup of coffee after the meal. You can go pick out what you want at the bakery counter.<br><br>Canter&#39;s also offers a take out deli where you can but things by the lb, and a bakery. <br><br>It is a great place to eat.... more than once.	1
Took my parents here for their wedding anniversary. Place is sick - killer ambiance, amazing food, pitch-perfect 20s/30s/40s jazz music, etc. Fans of Sleep No More will feel right at home. Only issue was that the elevators were busted that night, and it took a lot of convincing to get my dad (hip operation) and girlfriend (pregnant) to walk up the six flights. However, after some cajoling (and bitching) everyone made it up and all was well.	1
Yay for pick &#39;n choose customization. Great spot for a casual date or catchup with friends. It reminds me of those local, healthy, slightly crunchy (yet modern and chic) SF places that are sprinkled all over my old home city.<br><br>Service is PHENOMENAL - so friendly, super attentive, really passionate about fresh, healthy food. All the food was top notch except my smoked devil eggs (too salty) but they were immediately whisked away and taken off the bill without so much as asking.<br><br>The faves: kale salad (yum!), simple roast chicken (crispy!), and steamed kale/quinoa (simple!).	1
Can&#39;t believe this joint doesn&#39;t have a min. of 4.5 stars (must be the price). The Hickory burger rocks! Best burger I have ever had (kills In-n-Out on taste hands down). Fries are great and the apple pie is tops as well. Love the atmosphere in this place. The servers are no nonsense guys, service is super fast, and it is always a pleasure to throw them a generous tip. A bit pricey for a burger joint, but I&#39;ve never left with regrets.	1
Very non-descript building. In fact, not even a sign on the outside that I could see that said Paseo. I just followed the line down the sidewalk. Awesome inside, once you get there. Walls and ceiling are painted pink and green. Since I do not eat what this place is famous for, I opted for a fish sandwich, which I thought was very good. The others in my party ordered a pork sandwich, a chicken sandwich and a ham and cheese. First, the pork. My wife was very adamant that this is not even close to the best Cuban sandwhich she has eaten. Come to Burbank, we'll show you a Cuban sandwich. She said it wasn't bad, but not all that. I guess she should have tried the BBQ pulled pork, which we heard was killer. Must be, as I could see people sitting outside the restaurant everywhere chowing down on them. Next, the chicken. Not bad, very tasty and flavorful. And finally, the ham and cheese. Out of the four of us, this was said to be the best sandwich. The negative is that, with the prices, none of the sandwiches come with any kind of side, not even chips. I did order some black beans, but they were just okay. Nothing to write home about.	1
So good! Great flavor, diversity in flavor, vibrant food, good service! Always feel good when I leave so satisfied!	1
Matzo ball soup and corned beef with pastrami with coleslaw all over it...!<br><br>that&#39;s the usual for me... plus extra pickles!<br><br>just wish it was closer..<br><br>I love their sandwiches cos it&#39;s not to salty... <br><br>they have a waiter named vincent... he&#39;s funny! kinda awkward...<br><br>never really tried much of the bakery stuff... the black and white cookie was not really that good...<br><br>great food after a night or driking/partying!	1
Good burgers, horrible service.<br>Being a huge fan of Umami L.A. I was really excited when I found out that they would be opening in my city. My first visit the bartender did not ring in my cocktail till I asked him for a receipt, he then rung my drink in,...we were then seated and had a decent lunch.<br> I went back today and was completely ignored when I walked in, I asked the bartender if I should just seat myself, she said the hostess would be right with me, the hostess never came, the bartender told me I should seat myself, I did, and waited, and waited, and waited, staff kept walking by and ignoring me, not even an &#34;someone will be with you shortly&#34;, after about 10 minutes, I left. the dining room was pretty empty, there were more employees than tables seated, I guess my money must not be any good there, I will not be going back, I&#39;ve never seen such a poorly run establishment, too bad, I&#39;ve always been a fan.	0
We came here with a yelp coupon for an $80 dinner that included wine, appetizer, filet mignon, and dessert for two. Here comes the bad news.....<br><br>This was definitely not worth $80. The meat was really low quality and the filet mignon was really tough. I didn&#39;t know that it could happen. We were so disappointed since it was a steakhouse, and we expected that at least the steak would be good, if not the sides. However, the sides were greasy and the service was awful.<br><br>The owner tried to make it up to us, but the filet that he gave us the second time was tougher than the first one! Horrible! Then they gave us extra dessert and glasses of prosecco. But, it just doesn&#39;t make up for giving us and other customers the lowest quality steak they could find. <br><br>Everyone in the restaurant was eating on this coupon. I can&#39;t blame them, we were doing the same. It would be much much worse to pay full price. I will not come back. <br><br>Here&#39;s the warning: Save your money! <br><br>This was especially awful since it is NYC restaurant week and for a few dollars more we could have eaten at a decent place.	0
Their breakfast brie baby asparagus and fresh herbs is REALLY GOOD! Their smoked salon tartine is also super yummy! I really like this place!	1
Went here today for lunch, it was a huge disappointment ordered the bacon it was good but way to salty, the sides were disgusting the brisket was dry and the staff was very unfriendly !!!	0
THIS IS A GEM !!!<br><br> If your in the area stop in for a quick bite !!!	1
Why can't i get any consistency here???I love their Thai Cobb - my favorite salad ever... EVER, i say!but it's never the same - sometimes it's great, and sometimes it's just "eh"... the good points:24 hours - so it's perfect for after the bars inventive menu with cheeky names good foodbad points:impossible to park (unless it's 3am - then it's easy)inconsistency - but maybe it's because i love that one salad so much that i can taste the nuanced differences each time i go there...but i keep coming back for more - so this place is a keeper in my book.	1
Love it. Good music, drinks, service, location and view. Near pershing square, too cool.	1
This place is discriminatory against people that do not fit in with their "environment". They would not let us in because of what we were wearing. We were completely sober ad simply wanted to go inside for a quick drink together, and they reused to let us in because we didn't "fit in with their environment". They are snobby and discriminatory against people who they do not deem worthy to be in their restaurant. Simply put, if you do not look "fratty" they will not let you in.	0
I know the food is great-but-the maitre d&#39; was so rude about the seating that we did not stay for lunch! That does not happen very often!!!	0
Well, it was quite a nice layout. The apple martini was very sweet and unimpressive. The crab claws and oysters were warm. Otherwise the food was good not great. The jazz band was the highlight of the day. Expensive without value.	1
My goto deli/snack shop since I work in the area. Peter, his dad and staff are great, very friendly excellent service!	1
we totally enjoyed our experience. The food and service was wonderful. The noise level was high which made conversation difficult.I am a non-alcholic drinker and would prefer a quality beer to go with such a fine meal. Odouls is all you have to offer in non alcoholic. Becks or St. Pauli girl would have been nice. Odouls is awful beer. You should cater more towards non-alcoholic. Yhanks	0
Okay, first off who puts CILANTRO in ramen?! Ugh. Nope. I spent the first 10 minutes of my meal fishing out all the cilantro. Also, what&#39;s with the broth? It&#39;s kind of sweet, and just all kinds of wrong. I understand this is a &#34;fusion&#34; place, but still, there&#39;s no reason to claim that what I ate is considered &#34;ramen&#34;. The only things that saved this meal was the pork, the egg, and the iced tea. The pork was really good and I always love soft boiled eggs. Their iced tea was also nice and refreshing. The portions of the food seemed good, but that didn&#39;t help the taste much. It was a little pricy for ramen, but the size helped and it was nice that the egg was included. The layout of the whole restaurant is very..interesting. It&#39;s connected to Belly Q, which I guess is the fancier version of Urbanbelly? There&#39;s a fake wall that separates the two restaurants. At Urbanbelly you have to order at a counter first and then you can sit behind the counter to eat. Since you order your food first, there&#39;s not so much involved in the service aspect, but the workers at the counter were friendly and nice. Overall, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be back.	0
Just found this hidden gem tonight. We had the Surf and Turf, the Deviled Eggs, and the Crispy Duck...QUACK BACK! <br><br>The food is good and the music selection is right on. I&#39;ll be coming back for sure. Check out the private dining room with mermaid wall paper!	1
We were left to fend for ourselves for lunch on Calle Ocho so I yelped to find the best Cuban food close by. <br><br>Yes, it is in a supermarket but they seem to be doing most of their business from the restaurant. There&#39;s a long counter, a few high top tables and a couple of lower tables. Not great for groups but the 3 of us managed to score a table. <br><br>I had their vaca frita with onions, side of black beans and rice for $7. My auntie ordered a special (changes by day) which was a stuffed bell pepper. We actually ended up trading dishes because she liked mine so much. Our friend had a Cuban sandwich which was just the straightforward deli ham and swiss. Everything is cheap - our total was around $20. <br><br>Our service was great and lunch was quick - just what we were looking for. You also might want to brush up on your Spanish before you go too!	1
Absolutely the best Indian food I've ever had in the US. The service is wonderful too! I make trips to seattle just for this restaurant.	1
Delicious burger, perfectly cooked, and a lovely presentation. My only advice would be to not cut the burger in half. I know you want to share - but we regretted the cut - should have just enjoyed them in their whole natural state. The truffle cheese fries with the garlic aoli is the bomb dot com. Good beer selection...not so great wine selection. Give me a nice CA cab at a reasonable price!Fantastic service. Really nice folks!	1
This place has amazing breakfast and fresh juices. I always order the California omelet with an apple, beets, carrots juice. The service is pretty good, not over the top. The parking is convenient at a meter. Great place to eat!	1
Burger was dry. The fries were nothing special. The service was bad. Overall a dissapointing experience.	0
We had a wonderful dinner at BLT and superb service by Javier. We LOVED the popovers - they were heavenly!!!The chef sends out a complimentary appetizer of duck liver mousse topped with a raspberry gelee. Delicious!We enjoyed the crab legs special as our appetizer and loved that they sliced them down the middle for us for ease in eating. Dinner was a bone in NY Strip with sides of Brussels sprouts and mashed potatoes. The Brussels were cooked perfectly but a little sweet for our taste. We were too stuffed for dessert but Javier brought is a tasty cometary brownie bite as a treat to end our wonderful meal. My only complaint would be the Manager (don't know his name) - he visited the table next to us bringing them additional complimentary appetizers stating in earshot, &quot;we didn't have any VIPs tonight so you'll be our VIPs&quot;. While it was a nice gesture for that table, it wasn't what I expected to hear at a pale like that.	1
Came here with some friends for a few drinks and dinner and I will never come back again.	0
Great local pub. Good food. go for lunch, get the Rubin.	0
Service is very fast. The pancakes are delicious. Period. The sourdough toast is great too. I don't care about anything else here. Skip everything else and get pancakes.The eggs are fine. The potatoes are fine. Neither are great.Just get the pancakes!!	1
I know some people are going to get mad at me for this but I&#39;m giving it 4 stars just because I feel like they only use three spices.. spicy, lemon grass and fish sauce. I always feel like if I can make it then its not 5 star <a href="/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fgreat.To&amp;s=bef852bf950500ca770c44cfec8f4501659004930e985325f687dfda627dab5b" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">great.To</a> me, it&#39;s five star great if I taste it and go &#34; hmmm I must figure this recipe out..what is that spice?&#34; ...maybe I&#39;m wrong about the spicing and you want to FIGHT me, but I must warn you in advance that I am part filipino...ever heard of pacquiao? <br><br>I was told by my mom that this location was the original location..PERIOD. And in my opinion the best location.<br>Don&#39;t agree? I don&#39;t care, my mother is smarter than you. ;P<br><br>I have fond memories of eating here with my mother when I was a kid and enjoyed making yet another memory last weekend.<br><br>All I have to say is <br><br>SHRIMP SCAMPI + BEEF SATAY + THAI TEA + large fish tank = happy me. ^__^<br><br>the end.	1
I'd been looking forward to coming here after hearing good things and after a great experience at their small outpost, Little Skillet. Unfortunately, we had a pretty lousy time - a missing waiter for most of the meal who made us wait 25 minutes after we were clearly finished eating for our bill; dry fried chicken - a real sin; and loud, cheesy music that belonged in the elevator of a W, not the self-described "downhome soulful atmosphere" that the website purports. Maybe some Robert Johnson next time to soul the place up... I think Farmer Brown is past its prime if it ever had one. A dissapointment. (p.s. the sweet potato fries were amazing)	0
Can&#39;t believe people gave this place &#34;5 stars&#34;. Food came out after 35 minutes of sitting down and it was crappy crawfish that tastes like a week old. The staff was rude with a &#34;I don&#39;t care because we have a line out there&#34; attitude. Don&#39;t go, waste of your time. We are never coming back.	0
Come on, guys. Perhaps I came on a bad day. Perhaps I ordered the wrong dishes. But honestly, nothing was great and things were mostly bland. I got the roti canai - tasted like premade frozen stuff; char kway teow, fried rice and indian mee goreng was just bland bland bland, and the famous curry laksa was good, but not hike-worthy - especially if you live in Manhattan.<br><br>The best thing going for it was the friendliness of the servers: they took the time to recommend dishes and was surprisingly patient with the toddlers that were in my party.	0
First time I&#39;ve tried a Chinese/Korean restaurant and I&#39;m a fan! All of the dishes we ordered were tasty. The food comes quickly and the service is actually a lot better than most normal Chinese restaurants. The Mongolian beef was a highlight!	1
The ambiance of this place is everything! ...The food being delicious on top of that makes it just that much better. I had the surf and turf, Mac n cheese, lobster pop tarts, the treasure chest for desert and a sabrinatini to drink.. All amazing! Only downfall is that the restaurant is very small and is packed with very tiny tables so the big table decor looks nice but there's no room for it making it difficult to eat also the tables are so close that all night we were getting bumped by everyone and having the waiter's butts in our face every time they were tending our neighboring tables . (Great. )My tiniest complaint is our waiter didn't even bother to ask us for bottled or tap water just brought us tap but then was quick to ask the table next to us right after.. I know Your not assuming we look like the tap water type of people when paying $250 for a dinner for 2.. *distilled please*!	1
This is a late late review.. I came here like two years ago. HEHE. but i just thought of it. I always talk about it to my friends and recommend it to everyone but i never wrote about it!!now to help all of you hungry lost souls. check out LUNA PARK. its not like "OMG ITS TO DIE FOR." but its definitely a nice place to have dinner with friends. It's one of those dark restaurants during night time with a very casual relaxed atmosphere. As for food, we ordered the margherita pizza and something else.. i do not remember.. it was two years ago. :((but the food was DELICIOUS. i think two plates, or that one pizza, was enough to satisfy three hungry chicks. I also ordered the blackberry mojito and my friends got the sampler, which included small portions of this and that cocktails. It was definitely a little too strong so for those with high tolerances.. get the sampler. :))for dessert we ordered the smores. YUMMMMMMMY. i think thats one of the things that they're known for. it really is sooo good. i dont like chocolate, marshmallows, nor graham crackers. but why when you put it all together its freaking delicious?? hahahaha.:)) JUST TRY IT.anyways.. just try it. its good.	1
Originally intended on heading to a different bigger bar for a friend&#39;s special day, we all decided to skip the line waiting and head on over to the Far Bar. <br><br>There are apparently two entrances, the one which everyone raves about (the alley), and the one in the front with big see through doors that dare to hide nothing. At first glance I was like, hmm did we just go from an upscale American bar to a typical Asian bar? Guess we did, and this place reminded me of Wokcanos with its similar influences in the decor, and the narrow patio. The set up of the place is interesting, if you go through the front, you walk through the restaurant all the way to the restrooms, then make your way to another bar area and ending with the patio.<br><br>They have a lot of different types of whiskey, and their beer selection is great. I also had some wasabi fries, in which I highly recommend, and some chicken dumplings, which wasn&#39;t out of the ordinary. Great place to come drink, so so for big parties since the overall place isn&#39;t that huge, but still come check it out.	1
Went there today, had brunch and have to say that the Crab Benedict was amazing. Chillaquiles were okay. I&#39;m just very impressed with that crab cake Benedict- hence my mention twice. Will have again for sure. Good luck, G&amp;O. Hope you guys have success over there. I will agree with some of the cons listed by JJ F. My wife and I love to support local businesses so we will give it another go around and see how the evening bar scene works for us.	1
Great joint to get a bagel & lox, some free pickles, an egg cream, tomato juice, and some huge pastrami on rye sandwiches. Basically reminiscent of my numerous east coast dining experiences growing up with a Jewish dad. You can have breakfast at any time- that's what I want access to! Not in the mood? Have a matzo ball soup and potato knish- yum! It's a little weird that the knish comes with gravy, but it sure tastes good. My sister swears by the patty melt.This place has all the markings of a good deli/diner. Always crowded but you're still seated fast; this place is 24 hours and right by Cinefamily. Nice and clean with a good wait staff. Food is moderately priced and my favorite to grab on Fairfax after a movie. Lots of history here.. seems the older these diners are, the better they perform.	1
Came for breakfast and not the same experience. We ordered yogurt and it took nearly 30 min for them to serve us. Then the portion of yogurt you get is about a tablespoon on top of a cup or more of granola. Crazy to eat that much granola.Unlikely I would return here.	0
My darling,	1
Went on a Friday night with a group of friends, all going for the first time. It was around 10pm when we got there and it was already way too packed. I'm OK with having to wait to get a bartender to serve you sometimes, and on a weekend its par for the course, but this place was just crammed beyond capacity. I think the biggest problem with Far Bar is how small the place is in combination with a poor layout. The only bar is in a small room near the back where there WILL be patrons eating at the bar, thus taking up all the scant bar real estate. Just be prepared to do the "shouting your drink order over the people sitting at the bar in front of you, while the loud music blasting in the background will ensure that you will have to repeat it at least twice" maneuver. It's places like these that complex drink orders from your friends quickly turn into "just make it 3 of whatever youre having".Considering how many great drinking holes are in JTown, nevermind Downtown, I don't see anything special about Far Bar that would make me want to come back.	0
The appetizer, oysters rockefeler, crab cake and steakhouse chopped salada, were all a bit salty for me.  But, the steake, fillet mignon, prime rib and ribeye were very delicious.  I am satisfied with the dinner.  Only a complaint is the given address &quot;2101 Texas Star Lane&quot; is strange place, not the restaurant location by google map.	1
Had a lovely outing here. I&#39;d kept passing here and peeking in. Reviews were great so we gave it a try. Glad we did! What a sweet place. About 18 seats total, a few small tables and the rest by the bar. Wines were great and they let me taste a few till I found what l liked. The food was good, and they&#39;ve got a shelf full of games so we entertained ourselves playing Battleship till the food came. YAY!!! The most expensive thing on the menu was $20. Totally laid-back and unpretentious. Thumbs up!	1
First I was turned off by the unfriendly counter staff, then the ridiculously sour lemonade. <br><br>Then I got home with my burger and my hate blossomed. I asked for a medium rare cheese burger. What I received was a VERY rare small burger slathered with mayo! I think they drowned the cow with mayo in fact. I couldn&#39;t even bring myself to finish it. <br><br>I don&#39;t expect take out to be superb, but at least cook it right. Some indication of what is put on the burger would have been helpful since I didn&#39;t want f**king mayo...<br><br>My companion&#39;s catfish box also sucked. Too much pepper!!!<br><br>Don&#39;t waste your time.	0
My coworkers and I always joke about how &#34;remarkably average&#34; this place is. It&#39;s good, but not great. The service is always great, though; fast and friendly. The Mango Lassi is very good. The garlic naan is good, too. I usually get the Chicken Tikka Masala, but have gotten the chicken curry before; it was a little bland, compared to the Masala, but still average. I go a couple of times a month. Glad it&#39;s there. But it&#39;s nothing new or groundbreaking.<br><br>Edit: Found the secret. Channa Masala without onions is quite good. Also, again, the people working there are really nice. Bumped up to four stars.	1
I got a pot full of tofu with three mussels and three shrimps for $35. While the music was great, the food clearly gives a bad image of Korean food. I wouldn't recommend this place.	0
Great happy hour oysters- a wide selection and very fresh. Definitely the best I've had in Madison. Yum! The service has always been good, and the ambiance is very nice.	0
HB was great. The service was spot-on, the atmosphere is relaxed, and the food is delicious. <br><br>In particular, the Lamb Burger w/ Brie is fantastic. <br><br>I&#39;ve not yet been for brunch, but I&#39;d recommend it for dinner - and they have a 3 course prix-fixe menu on Wednesdays.	1
Decent food, I usually took my lunches here for the cute family cafe atmosphere...but don't be fooled. They can over change you of your debit/credit and your cash and customer service can be a little pushy...The other day ago during my lunch hour, I was both: 1) charged more than what I paid for and 2) only after sitting for 15 minutes or less, I was asked to leave even though I was a patron and bought a coffee with some cookies there because, of what I was told, that there are other people that needed to be seat (the owner probably though I was not a paying patron)...It really felt rude to me, as I was not only cheated out my money but also asked to leave.The money problem is really slick too...they'll add up the balance really fast but the totally will out with an additional 50 cents to a dollar more. Sure it's not so much but I don't think it's ethical on my part.As a paying customer, I have a right to use their dining area. Isn't it what it's for? Regardless if there are more customers now than 15 minutes ago? I understand the limited space...but 15 minutes is rather a small time frame for a decent, relaxing lunch break.I came to this cafe to experience a delightful family atmosphere..it's there...but I can't go back without being reminded of the dirt under the table.I have to say, it's decent for a quick run, if your running out of time or don't know the local area...go ahead...but make sure they get the numbers right and yourself seated without such a time limit.There are other and better places to take your lunches elsewhere...I first chose this place for the convenience and local atmosphere but it seems like I'll be taking my lunches elsewhere.	0
My friends and I ate there last week. I give five stars for the srevice, our server was wonderful. But the food was absolutely bland and blahhh..they really don&#39;t have a good selection and entrees, and what they had tasted like..water. I had the cod, which was absolutely tasteless. It&#39;s hard to make tasteless lamb, and I tired some of my friends&#39; and it was very blah as well. <br><br>My friend who had the lamb, fell sick all day on Friday. I would recommend for drinks and wine, however, the food is absolutely blah and not worth almost $100/person.	0
It's not the best sulung tang place in Ktown, but it's definitely the most convenient and I would be so sad and hungry if Young Dong wasn't around. They open super late and has the most BOMB kimchi in ktown. You can purchase extra Kimchi for $1 and their sulungtang has clean and rich flavor. Easy parking in the back but watch out for bad asian drivers!	1
I first went to the original place next to Porky&#39;s gym back in 1995 and was greeted by toni and his wife. This place had a great aroma and the food was even better. I use to work for a competitor back in the day ( Mike&#39;s Pizza) and while I was sitting inside I see frances ( mikes Wife) doing a drive by to check out the competition. Well needless to say Mike nneds to watch out, even though Mike has a great reputation, but when the staff isn&#39;t taking proper care of the clients they will go else where. I had been there many times since and consider this one of the better Pizza and Pasta joints. There&#39;s plenty to go around for everyone.. I truley reccommend this place.	1
It's alright for cheap Italian, and the portions are large. But whats lacking is flavor. The food is so-so no matter what you get. The smoothies, however, are quite good and make it somewhat worth it.	0
Perfect amount of selection on the menu but still keeping it a burger place. Enough healthy options and good quality food	1
Great service and excellent food! You have to try the Pork Tonkatsu... Masarap!!! They have a wide variety of traditional Filipino foods. We will definitely be back!	1
I came to this place 11times already and yet I never had any complains until this time. This male server w glasses named Michael helped us first. He was rushed to leave when we werent even done asking stuff. He even threw our meat over the table when he changed the grill twice. No apologies whatsoever.<br>For us ordering more than 20 dollars for AYCE place, he left the bad taste in our mouth. Surprisingly he was the only bad server but other female server and male server were more than nice. They talked nicely and even politely offered to bring stuff when we didnt even ask. I had noticed Michael was smoking outside when we were leaving. Maybe just maybe the owner or manager is not reading yelp reviews but please get better server if u want the business to last otherwise this place will remain as other AYCE place that only serve non korean people.	0
Small place so when I found out later it was very limited for reservations. They lock your table for the night so planning ahead is KEY. We had 345pm reservations for V-day, it worked out great but for future reference, call early and ask for lounge area or specific table you want. Was a bit chilly (but it was also freezing outside and snowing later) great food and service. Wine by the glass was great (especially since I dragged a non-wine drinker with me) would defininetly go again for girls night or with a small group of wine lovers.	0

(food poisoning)	0
Came here with the lady lookin for burgers n beer on a weekend night. You're definitely going to need a reservation, it was packed.Before I get to the food, a little about the ambiance...it's loud and cramped. All of the tables are jammed up on each other with a large bar style table occupying the lionshare of the room. The bar is in the back-ish with no real breathing room. Did I mention it was loud?So, they had a number of good draft beers to choose from, I opted for the Allagash white, the lady got some Delirium.We ordered the burger medium with truffle fries (truffles were extra), as well as a shrimp pizza.The food took a good while to finally come out, but like i said it was packed in there. To our dismay the burger was cooked well and probably a bit past that. This resulted in it being dry with the unusually large amount of cheese dominating the palette.Truffle fries weren't very truffley.Shrimp pizza was a fail. While the thin crust was fresh and tasty, the cheese wasn't great, there was no sauce, and there were only like 3 pieces of shrimp. If you're dying to try a pizza there, don't get this one.On top of this, the diva waitress only showed up to take the order and basically throw the check down at us. The bus staff did the rest. Again, I get that it's busy, but you shouldn't be rude to the customer.On the brighter side of things, there is a bank parking lot that you can use at night right behind The Six.With so many other great "gastropubs" out here on the west side, I see no reason to come back here. Upper West kicks the crap out of this place.	0
Me and two of my friends decided to come here for dinner, one of them was entirely new to little tokyo, so I was pretty excited for him.<br><br>Anyways, we were mobbin&#39; around little tokyo, trying to find a place to eat that had rice and sushi, and after walking around all of little tokyo, we checked out their menu and decided to give them a try. I&#39;ve always wanted to try it out though, because the exterior decor is interesting, but was always too intimidated to go in. What if it was filled with sushi connoisseurs and elitist japanese food lovers?<br><br>The atmosphere was pretty cool and laid-back. I liked their little kitty that had a moving paw. We were seated right away, no wait time! I checked out their menu, and saw it was a little pricey... but nothing that would hurt. So after flipping back and forth, I checked out their dinner specials, and it had everything I was looking for. I went ahead and ordered #3 - Sashimi, Pork Cutlet, Sushi, Salad, and Soup. It also came with green tea ice cream at the end. At first, I thought you had to choose what type of fish you wanted, but the waiter told me you get all the fish. EFF YEAH!<br><br>They came out with the miso soup first, and it was great. Shortly after, our meals came out right on time. I had the pork cutlet which was like katsu (I&#39;m not entirely sure, but it was like chicken katsu, except pork). Macaroni salad, pickled lettuce, some cucumber stuff, sashimi, 2 california rolls, spicy tuna, and shrimp. The pork was perfect, it wasn&#39;t too fried, and the sauce it came with was good. The sashimi was really good, and the sushi was great... except it has a pretty intense surprise. Underneath it lies a smudge of wasabi, so if you don&#39;t like it or are sensitive to it, watch out!<br><br>The service was good, they refilled our waters without us having to ask. When we finished, they took our plates. I was still hungry and I completely forgot about the ice cream! After taking our plates, they came back out with our ice cream! I figured this would fill me up, and it filled me up perfectly. They had no problem with us splitting the bill three-ways, and the waiter came back with our card, pen, and receipt all put underneath the pen cap. I know... small detail, but I thought it was nice of them.<br><br>TLDR; All around good. Service, food, and atmosphere.	1
The world's best Mac and Cheese lives up to its name! The cheese is so creamy -- well worth the price! And seeing them mix up the cheese while you eat adds to the experience.	1
came here the other day and got the BRAISED SHORT RIB baguette. SOOOOO GOOD!! go there and get it before they change their seasonal menu!!! comes with watercress and aioli. soooooo good, i cant stop thinking about it. and the portion size is pretty big!also got the $19 lunch prixe fix for the day: summer veggies salad which was good. the lemon vinaigrette was too sour for me. the entree was fresh pasta with parm cheese, bacon and peas. really yummy!!! exceptionally yummy!!! and dessert was a small creme brulee. and service was really good. better than last time. :)	1
Really great place. The location is a bit weird, but once there you quickly forget that. The decor is spot on. I went there to discuss business with a potential client, so couldn't really go crazy on the food. The service was really good, the waitress realized we were discussing business and gave us some privacy. We all ordered the onion soup, which was really good, but in my opinion needed a little more seasoning. I ordered the steak tartare as my entree and it was delicious. The meet had a coarse grind that felt somewhat "rustic". My clients both ordered the lamb and they seemed to really enjoy it. After dinner I ordered an espresso which was perfectly made. I am definitely coming back to try it again.	1
Sugar rush. I ordered a dish I hoped would be savory the mushroom reuben and was grossed out by the sweetened portobellas and oil soaked rye bread. The tunes were cranked up so loud that my party of five struggled to converse leaning into the table and repeating ourselves to be heard. The noise was stressful and the sugar crash made the afternoon drag on forever. The two folks who had the tomato soup remarked about a bitter aftertaste they couldn't identify. I was so sorry I recommeded the place to the group (based on Yelp and Urban Spoon ratings).	0
Food = five stars. Problem is you have to put up w horrible service. Hostess was super rude. Bartenders super slow. Waiter brought our appetizer and entree before our drinks. So sad I was so looking fwd to coming back here this trip. The service really marred the experience. :-(. I was also informed that their rum options for mojitos are now ltd to Bacardi. Used to be a great place to try different rums.	0
good but overpriced.	1
I came here with a friend for brunch on a Sunday. It has an interesting lay out. We were seated in the patio and I really liked the landscape. I have to say it's a great hidden spot in Silverlake with over 650 reviews. The waitress was great and attentive. She was full of suggestions. Luckily for us the place was empty. The food was really good. My friend ordered the fruit crepes and I had the Kobe burger. I noticed that their menu changed so this review is strictly for those two items. My friend said the fruit crepes was delish and the fruit was really fresh. The Kobe burger was good, but my only gripe would be that the burger wasn't cooked to my instructions. The overall experience was great and I would definitely come back. Cliff's Edge is a solid 4* for me.	1
I&#39;ve been coming here since I was a toddler. Aside from the nostalgia factor the Apple Pan serves up one of my favorite burgers. As you can imagine I&#39;m a huge fan of the hickory burger. The food is always fresh and tasty. I have never had a soggy fry here. Their pies are a force to be reckoned with (Apple being the obvious choice).	1
Will not be coming back. The place is simply horrible. The good is great but service and management is simply not well put together. They didn&#39;t have anything literally. What a shame.	0
This is a great date spot and really cute. We went here tonight after work and I felt a little under dressed, but the wait staff made us feel right at home.<br><br>We shared and loved everything. The stuffed shrimp and poutine were delicious! I saved room for dessert and we shared the sticky toffee pudding. Also delicious.<br><br>I also didn&#39;t realize we would be in for a musical treat. They had a jazzy band there that was really good. I will definitely be back to visit other items on the menu.	1
The food here was amazing, I was really surprised - I thought it would be okay, but was honestly pleased with everything that we ordered. The prime rib was fantastic, probably one of the best prime rib&#39;s I&#39;ve ever had! We also ordered Fish and Chips, they were very good, and one order of BBQ Ribs which we also done perfectly.<br><br>Service was outstanding, no complaints there at all. Everything was paced very good.<br><br>I would receommend this place while in town, we were staying at the Hilton Mag Mile, got in late and The Local was very convienant because you can get into it from the hotel lobby.<br><br>Desserts were tasty too if you have room after the dinner!	1
This place has potential. Good vibe, good selection of wine and a nice cross section of food but there is something lacking. We started with the meatballs and arugula salad. The meatballs were light not heavy and had a nice sauce. The salad had a nice vinaigrette but it was just a pile leaves. The salad needed something else besides a few pieces of cheese, perhaps tomatoes.We then ordered the specials of the evening a New York steak, which was good, no complaints, and the spicy sausage pizza.The pizza is not good. I hate to do comparisons but it wasn't any better than a frozen variety. Finally, when it came time for desert, they had no coffee, so we didn't order any desert.	0
Love this restaurant, always great food, good wine list, nice ambience and music, delicious deserts!	1
I&#39;ve eaten here twice now. Once for lunch, where we were the only people in the restaurant. The second time for dinner on a Tuesday, where they were packed and painfully understaffed. <br><br>For lunch I had tacos, and took a vegan friend because I&#39;d heard great things about their vegan options. She was very pleased, trying the vegan mousaka and tacos. I had fish tacos and they were yummy, but a bit overpriced for the area by my count. Still, when another friend wanted something veggie-centric, I took her for dinner. <br><br>We had to wait five minutes before anyone attempted to seat us. (They have no hostess, so you have to wait for the wait staff to notice you.) Then seated us in a corner near a stack of chairs. So, not very comfortable, but it&#39;s cool, right? They&#39;re busy. But then we waited and waited for the waitress to come over to even give us menus. The whole time we saw a couple next to us (inches away) were waited on with grace and warmth, and sometimes we got noticed too. We felt ignored. <br><br>Finally, we ordered salads. They were awful. Mine was wilted and the dressing (blood orange vinagarette) was wet but tasted like nothing. Hers was so lacking in dressing that she actually choked on it. We considered sending them back, but our waitress would have to notice us for that to happen. <br><br>To her credit, she did apologize, explaining they are way busier than they expected and so were understaffed--how about free coffee and dessert? We decided to make the best of it, and so I ordered the house special--Timtam Tiramasu. The waitress talked it up quite a bit, and I was freshly excited, ready to forget the hiccups so far. <br><br>THEN the dessert arrived, and she tells us, &#34;They were actually out of the Timtam tiramisu, so I had them make one fresh. Enjoy!&#34; That sounds nice, except tiramisu has to sit. Otherwise it&#39;s just a wet mess. And this was. I was so disappointed. Then the owner came over, and I guess I could have laid out my complaints. But she had just had a chipper conversation with the couple next to us who had nothing but praise. She apologized for our wait and asked how our desserts were, we lied. It felt rude to complain about a free dessert. <br><br>With so many exceptional restaurants in our area, I can&#39;t justify going back here.	0
I want to like it. I love the concept. The menu is solid, with a satisfying array of choices. The wine and beer list is also strong and offers some good value. But the food is just not very good, and the service is cold.<br><br>We went in on a Friday evening. It was not empty, but was not full either. We were seated promptly, but the hostess was not friendly. This describes the service throughout our experience - competent but cool. Not a dealbreaker for me, but whereas excellent service can help you enjoy a lackluster meal more, feeling like it&#39;s a burden for the server to take your order probably increases the odds you won&#39;t overlook the flaws in your food.<br><br>I ordered the burger, having read positive reviews, including a quote on their website that it is one of the best burgers in LA. Boy was it not. <br><br>First, the burger is almost impossible to eat. It arrives pierced with a steak knife, and I can&#39;t imagine picking it up without first cutting it in half. They know it needs the knife; why not do the cutting for me? But this is a forgivable fault - many burgers are difficult to eat.<br><br>The flavor was the killer here. Try as I might, I could not detect any sign that the burger had been seasoned. At all. It looked like decent quality beef (if cooked past the medium-rare I ordered), and the texture was fine, but it tasted like cardboard. The thick smear of blue cheese on top completely overwhelmed the entire burger. The underripe tomatoes and fried red onion did not help.<br><br>In fairness, the sweet potato fries were nothing to complain about. And my wife&#39;s smoked trout salad was apparently not bad - but not good either.<br><br>My previous experience with the food here was limited to the pizzas, which I found underwhelming. I was hoping that maybe those just weren&#39;t The Six&#39;s strong suit, as is the case at many restaurants that don&#39;t focus on pizza. Unfortunately, it seems that the food just isn&#39;t good here, so I don&#39;t think I will be returning.	0
Great place! I have great memories of this place, since I dragged my friends out to the Payless across the street and when my guy friend jumped off the high curb, he rolled his ankle. It&#39;s funny and sad at the same time.<br><br>But going back to the Wood Cafe, we specifically picked this place to try out together because my friends own a big dog. We got an outdoor table so the dog can hang out with us. Great place to have Sunday brunch, ambiance is lovely, food is tasty (organic stuff, you know west la) and will probably cost you $15 or less for a complete meal. <br><br>While parking behind the restaurant is limited, there is plenty of street parking in this area. <br><br>Just be careful stepping off of the high sidewalk, lest you end up like my friend.	1
everything on the menu is great and the eggplant hot pot is divine!	1
I like it here. It&#39;s pretty freakin korean, but that&#39;s what happens when you get korean food in ktown, right?<br><br>They&#39;re known for their... you guessed it, noodles!! They make their own noodles for the soup, and it&#39;s really delish and fresh. I&#39;ve been here a couple times, and I order the beef noodle soup, or whatever it&#39;s called in korean. It&#39;s a pretty damn big bowl, with lots of noodles, some beef, and a few veggies. I add some of the various sauces and such to give the broth some more flavor, but that&#39;s just because I love my salt. It&#39;s always really filling, I can never get through more than half of it. But MMMMM is it good, especially when it&#39;s cold and dreary outside.	1
Excellent teriyaki good prices good service and pretty decent sushi. (Although they seem to like to put cucumber in rolls that are supposed to have avocado according to the menu.) Really I shouldn't complain. They're consistently tasty and fresh- we go about once a month.	1
They have reinvented the hamburger and it&#39;s great.	1
I went to Manichi for the first and last time today. I ordered their house ramen (#1 on the menu) andThe broth was very &#34;watered down&#34; and flavorless. Furthermore the pork was minimal. If you&#39;re thinking of going there, you may as well go right next door to daikokuya and get proper ramen.	0
I love that this location is hidden in this little shopping plaza and next door to the best Urban Outfitters and has a cute outdoor seating area where there is a stage where some bands will play. The menu has about 8-9 burgers, plenty of beer options and I recommend getting the Truffle burger, it melts in your mourth and full of juicy flavor but of course Truffle is an aquired taste so I would recommend the signature Umami burger, best suited for those who like a bit of sweet with their savory (But you should still get the Truffle burger) Don't forget to rock the Truffle Cheese Fries!!! They are AMAZING! OMG so good... nom nom nom..... Everytime I come with my husband we always order the Truffle Fries and it is always sold out!!!! but hey no Truffle? no problem... Thin Fries is always delicious -- perfectly fried and comes with an Awesome Umami Ketchup... I don't know what it is... Truffle in the ketchup? IDK... but its soo good.What I remember trying:Truffle Burger - Amazing! Melts in your mouth and very juicyAhi Tuna Burger - Delicious! perfectly seared and fresh - you'd be surprise how the ginger insidegives it a nice crips and works pefectly together... (My fav Burger)Earth Burger - Delicious.. I use to always order this - I can't explain it, but its so good if you don't want to eat any meat, only thing I don't like is that it falls apart when I bit it.Thai Shrimp Burger - Not good. I really did not enjoy this burger.Cheesey Tator Tots - I really didn't think anything special about it.Onion Rings - Delicious but you only get a few pieces...Truffle Fries & Thin Fries - AMAZING!	1
I had such a pleasant first experience at the Bounty, I decided to have my wedding dinner here. Now, bringing in 12 people for dinner can be a dicey prospect, and there&#39;s bound to be a snag or two with such a big crowd. But dang, the folks at the Bounty went out of their way to make us all feel welcome and comfortable (even though we were late), put up with many demanding voices and food allergies with grace and care, filled us all to the brim with delicious food and drink, and made no move to rush us despite how much space we were taking on a busy night. It was such a nice cozy atmosphere to top off a whirlwind day, and everyone in our group loved every minute of it. There are few restaurants I can think of that could pull off a 12 for 12 approval rating. They&#39;re just downright nice people, and they&#39;ve created a lovely neighborhood space with perfectly yummy food and drink. I can&#39;t thank them enough for being so accommodating and helping to make our day some of the best fun we&#39;ve ever had.	1
Great place great service Edgar was a great waiter the breakfast was amazing I cleaned my plate	1
I went there the other day while waiting g to pick up my wife from the airport. This place is great. I wouldn&#39;t say the ribs were Kansas City good, but they were really good. Much better than what you might expect from a bar. The also make good cheap drinks and it doesn&#39;t smell like smoke in there. I&#39;ll be back.	1
The ambiance is just fantastic as my dates wish to always come back to this place. My only complaint is that it&#39;s a tad pricey for the type of meal(s).<br><br>Very romantic and a hidden gem in Silver Lake.	1
What a great place. Great meat, wine and especially service. The waiters were very attentive and not pushy. My bf and I had the parrillada for 2 and they did everything possible for us to enjoy our meal. The area is very quiet but the place is nice, intimate and very comfortable. I look forward to going back especially for the nice service. Manager make sure you keep your good guys happy	1
On a partly sunny saturday afternoon, we waited in line for about 30 minutes to get some food and find a place to sit. The place seems to get very very crowded at around lunch time on weekends so be prepared for the wait.	1
Because it was NYE , the restaurant was very busy, and our reservation was not until 8:45. Perhaps the kitchen had been overworked, but our food was disappointing. Our waiter was very nice and prompt with menus and drinks, but then took a great deal of time in taking order and bringing bread.  Salads were very good, but huge!  When orders arrived, mine was the wrong item and my partner's was cold. His lamb was cooked and warm but the vegetables were actually cold. Our waiter was most apologetic, the manager herself brought out the corrected order, but stood with an annoyed look to make sure our food was warm enough. We said it was fine, simply to get on with it. By now, the lamb was over cooked, his and my vegetables barely warmed up and my scallops were tasty, but not hot!  Our waiter certainly did his best, but even though the restaurant comped my entree, we left unsatisfied	1
I've been to this location years ago and was craving some chicken so I stopped by yesterday and they've remodeled into this weird small fake fancy restaurant concept. Ordered a small order of boneless chicken strips and french fries.They tasted fine. The sauces were fine. But no spicy hot sauce options??My bill was $20.00!What a total rip off. I mean this is children's menu or bar food. The restaurant has a cold clothing store retail vibe. Such a small weird overpriced place that serves chicken wings but doesn't even have beer. I don't get it.	0
We love going here to have sushi and the hibachi rice. The tostones and ceviche are awesome too. Last time we sat a the bar and the chef behind the counter was pretty entertaining.	1
Brunch at the Rowhouse Grille was a great way to kick-off a day of food and football downtown.  I had a crab, cheddar, and asparagus omelete that was sensational, and enjoyed the single spiciest bloody mary I've ever tried - a Habanero Bloody Mary.  Walking distance to M&amp;T Bank Stadium.  A spectacular experience!	0
Have since eaten at this incredible restaurant 4 more times. Anytime family is on town we take them here and every single experience has been outstanding. Truly. If you have not tried Alimento you need to remedy that ASAP. The food is phenomenal. Every dish (and I think I have tried them all apart from the veal ((just not my thing)) The service, every time, has been perfect - so well timed and the tall waiter with the sleeve tattoos (I should know his name) we have had him 3 times, and he is literally the best waiter I have ever had. So informed, so articulate, so kind (even to our out of town family that were, shall we say, ummmmm a little difficult. Even then he was gracious and amazing and I was so thankful we got him again!). As far as the noise level is concerned I find it just right. It's vibrant but I can always have a conversation no problem. We were there with 70- somethings last night and we all talked and talked and talked with no problem. Highest marks!!	1
Love the $3 pints and $6 appetizers during happy hour. Friendly staff and a great bar to sit at. Try the $6 happy hour nachos.	0
Carbonara pizza is the bomb! Only piece of feedback is that they need more support at the bar on a Saturday night..the guy was slow and seemingly frazzled.	1
The food was alright nothing special but the service was unreasonably poorWe had a 3 course meal and we had to remind the waiter and manager to give us each course we didn't even get to dessert because they took so long with the first courseOver all our experience was disappointingWorst experience yetFor the price, this place is nowhere near up to par Its unfortunate because it looks so promising from the outside oh well!	0
We love Luna Blu and highly recommend it.  This is our second time there and we are anxious to return to Annapolis to eat here again.  The selection is extensive in regards to all courses offered.  The $35 4-course dinner is a wonderful opportunity to try their wide array of appetizers and entrees.  The portions are more than adequate throughout all of the courses.  They have a very nice variety of wines by the glass and bottle; some by the glass that you don't ordinarily see.  The interior is small and cozy so I definitely recommend making a reservation.  Service was great; our waitress, Morgan, was very attentive and very helpful with the menu options.  A real find in Annapolis!	0
All I can say is Hopper Roll and WOW! AMAZING food and ambiance, will definitely be back soon!	1
Having had a great take out experience my wife and I decided to try dining in with our 2 year old daughter. MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!!!!! Our daughter has been with us to the Tasting kitchen and Gjelina on several occasions with great success. This was NOT the case with The Doughroom.  They would not do ANY substitutions ie we wanted the pepperoni pizza minus the pepperoni (they DO NOT serve a plain cheese pizza) and the waiter informed us that could not happen. I asked if he could just put the pepperoni on the side because my wife and daughter are vegetarians the answer was NO. The only cheese pizza they offer has a spicy cheese on it, not suitable for a toddler. When asked if the spicy cheese could not be used on the pizza the answer was NO. My wife is pregnant and ordered the brussel sprouts and there's liquor in the recipe, so we asked for that could not be used and the answer was NO.  I've never been a restaurant with such a strict policy for NO substitutions, especially a pizza spot!!  They are obviously trying to appeal to an older crowd without kids, which for a pizza spot is a horrible business model. Look at the success of Pitfire and Wildcraft and take note. They make substitutions for people, they have become integrated into the community, which has solidified their businesses in our community. The Doughroom is going to have a hard road with such a nonsensical set of rules that will alienate a large number of customers with kids and people with dietary issues.  This is a pizza spot is off the beaten path, surrounded by neighborhoods and families with zero foot traffic. We're not talking about some fancy spot on Abbot Kinney. Such key factors should be thought of when creating ones business model. They should embrace the customers in the neighborhood who will end up making their business a success or a failure. Needless, to say at 6pm on a Saturday night there were MANY open tables. We walked out and took our $50.00 meal elsewhere.  WE WILL NEVER GO BACK!!!!!!!!	0
Not a bad placeLots of beers on tapGood cocktailsLots of tv's Security ppl are niceOther than that nothing too special	0
You go here to get your food &amp; go. You can wait for or eat at the next door bar, if you wish. Their Bibmbop is great. Their French fries are to DIE for!!! I&#39;d go here just for them! Bibm Bop, garlic rice, and ribs are personal favs...	1
I came here with the best intentions. I really wanted to like it, but it was an EPIC fail!The cute seating area upstairs and my company were the only two positives of my dining experience at Per Diem. First off, I know that as a veg head I can't expect restaurants to cater to my non meat eating dietary restrictions. However, I've never had a restaurant be more unaccommodating than Per DIem. When asked about vegetarian pasta options, the waitress said, 'Well all the pastas have meat in them, but if you really have your heart set on a pasta... I guess we can give you the tagliatelle dressed in pesto." Seriously? You expect me to pay $20 for that? The chef can't throw in a few mushrooms? Heck, I'll even take a few peas, anything.Nonetheless, even after that convincing statement from our waitress, I opted against the pasta and settled for a vegetarian pizza. It was some potato, leek or celery concoction. Not seasoned at all and lackluster at best. Oh wait, don't let me forget the horrible appetizer we ordered. Whatever you do DO NOT order the 'Burrata on a Grilled Crostone.' It was terrible. Just picture a store bought piece of bread with mozzarella, slivered almonds and honey smothered on top. Ok so maybe everything minus the store bought bread sounds good, but trust me it was the worst excuse for an appetizer that I've ever seen. Especially at a restaurant that has the gall to charge $10 for a piece of bread!!!Overall bad restaurant, especially for vegetarians!	0
Oh, Morrison... How I really really wanted to like you.<br><br>My wife and I live down the street, LOVE Scottish everything (food, whisky, beer, music), and after living in Edinburgh for a short time really lamented the lack of good authentic Scottish places to go eat in LA. Then imagine our joy when this place showed up on our doorstep!<br><br>We went a few times when it first opened (this review took a while to write, one of those &#34;man I need to write that review&#34; moments that never quite did), and were impressed with the whisky selection and the taste of the food.<br><br>So, pros: whisky selection, great service (everyone is very nice there), food is tasty<br><br>BUT the food was very expensive compared to portion size, as were the drams of whisky. Here, it&#39;s $14 or $15 for a glass of scotch. In another favorite spot a short drive away, the same pour is $10.<br><br>So we wrote them a letter - a nice letter - to one of the managers named Brian. We called twice to be sure to get the correct email address. It was just a friendly note saying &#34;hey, we really want to come all the time, but your price point is just too high to keep us coming back all the time, like we want to&#34;. There were also some particularly egregious things, such as ordering the $8 &#34;scotch eggs&#34; on the &#34;shareables&#34; section of the menu and receiving a single, regular-sized scotch egg (singular). So we put all of this into the letter. It was nice and respectful, but a bit too long to include in the review as it goes over the word count limit.<br><br>We never heard back. Not anything at all.<br><br>Now, they could have said &#34;Thank you for your feedback and we hope you continue to enjoy our restaurant, we have this price point blah blah blah...&#34; and that would have been fine. I&#39;ve seen other posts on yelp about the prices so I know we&#39;re not nuts.<br><br>What eventually peeved us enough to not want to go back there is a total lack of response to our letter. None whatsoever. Again, I&#39;m not looking for them to fix the problem, or offer me drinks, or anything - all that Brian needed to do was acknowledge our opinion and thank us for our interest in his establishment. But that sadly never happened, and now every time we walk past this place we say to ourselves &#34;We really wish that were our regular spot.&#34; If they&#39;d responded at all, we&#39;d just go once in a while on a &#34;splurge&#34; night. But now, we just won&#39;t go at all.<br><br>Again all the servers we encountered there were very nice, we just couldn&#39;t continue to patronize a restaurant that seemed to not care about its customers&#39; opinions. I hope maybe Brian reads this and looks back to February 21st and can give us a shout to explain why we were never acknowledged in the first place.	0
I&#39;m not gonna lie. I feel freakin&#39; fat when I leave and overstuffed, hard to breathe.<br>I&#39;ve eaten here about 2 times &amp; I have always left satisfied.<br>This place is pretty spacious and I feel like it would be good for big groups with a reservation of course.<br><br>They have a lot of items to choose from here to eat, but they&#39;re all not great either.<br>I liked the dwenjangjjigae, doshirak, pork cheek, beef prime rib, <br>The dongchimigooksu is so gross and also their kimchi jjigae sucks too.<br>I&#39;m a huge pork belly fan and this place doesn&#39;t have great pork belly.<br><br>Overall: I feel like you get a lot for what you pay for. I think it&#39;s definitely worth the price.<br><br>Parking: Valet	1
Had a late lunch here with my family after a graduation. I've been to several other Francesca's in the Chicago area and this one was just as good. The one advantage this location had over the others was definitely space. My previous experiences have always been stuck at a small table with inches between the next and in the way of traffic. Service was prompt and attentive, and the food was fresh and flavorful. The bread that they brought out for us was still warm, which was great. We started with the bruschetta and carpaccio. Both were good, but I was a little surprised to see the big dollop of ricotta cheese on top of the bruschetta. I had the white fish special which was cooked just right and had a nice lite flavor. Others had chicken with mushrooms and pasta with pancetta and enjoyed their dishes as well. I don't normally go out of my way to dine at a Francesca's so I only gave it 3 stars, but it has always been a solid choice and I've never had a disappointing meal.	0
Two words: Just go!	1
When I was in Italy I ate individual pizzas for lunch pretty frequently but they were always a few more inches in diameter than MOD's pies.	1
The service, the food, the drinks, the vibe, the creativity....I could go on! Just fantastic!!	0
What a cool little spot in downtown! When I first discovered Far Bar, I used to come here after eating dinner in downtown or little Tokyo but after discovering their food I have come here for dinner many times! Some of the awesome things: The beers: ranging from microbrews (did not even know they make that many beers in California) to imported bottles from Asia you will find one that fits your liking. Mixology: their mixed drinks are also quite delicious and the bartenders know what they are doing. Wasabi Fries: no explanation neededFusion Sushi - a delicious spin on some of the traditional rollsOutdoor seating - one of the coolest things about Far bar is their European style outdoor terrace complete with a wall projector. Highly recommend!	1
Okay, I guess I'm picky about eating Japanese food here in the U.S. since it's nothing compare to eating it in Japan. The ramen that I ate was eh...I feel like I could have just gone to Japantown to get better ramen but it was late night so I can't complain since many of the restaurants were already closed. I think the noodles were like not cooked all the way so it wasn't that great but the soup was good. Anyways, the service was alright though.	0
I came here on a Sunday around noon for brunch with my boyfriend. The staff was kinda friendly, but not super attentive. We sat outside which is a really nice layout. I had the eggs Benedict which came with homefries and my boyfriend had pancakes. Everything was delicious and priced well. So glad I finally found a brunch spot close to my house! <br><br>I&#39;m only giving 4 stars because the parking situation is pretty bad and the service could have definitely been better!	1
Wow. This place was bad. Poor service. The napkins on our table were all stained with wine. The menus we were handed had food remains on them. I ordered the chorizo Benedict. It was a minor step up from a microwave brunch. The potatoes were under cooked. The lettuce not fresh. It all just screamed "we're not even trying"Avoid at all costs. A glorified Denny's.	0
Gone a few times for brunch and went again today. Best Bloody Mary--light and crisp! Seating isn&#39;t crammed, which is nice in Brooklyn. Portions are generally good and brunch pre-fixe is priced affordably ($14 +tx). Just wished I got some actual short ribs on my order today! Came with literally only the silverskin on the plate under my eggs, as if someone ate the meat before plating. :-( I was very disappointed on the stinginess there but hope it was just a one-time mistake. Had it before and it was great. I&#39;ll give them another shot before writing them off.	0
In my search for some grub on Friday night, I came upon Trencher. Funny how I&#39;ve been to this neck of the woods so many times and didn&#39;t notice when this place opened up.<br><br>Since it was pretty late that night, they only had their late night menu which consists of 4 or so items. I went for the pulled pork and angus beef sliders. They were on the smaller side, but still a very tasty snack. Actually, I&#39;d say that their late night menu is mostly small portions. <br><br>Still, I&#39;d love to return during daylight hours and try their regular menu.	1
Don&#39;t be fooled by the garden like appearance of this place.<br>You can get some serious grub here. Like the lasagna and the quinoa salad. Definitely hearty eats.<br>My lunch favorite: Avocado Hummus wrap. Soooo delicious.<br><br>A MUST: the juices!<br>I was raving about the carrot ginger juice. It was so refreshing and fresh, and the flavor combination was unlike anything I&#39;ve ever had.	1
Went here for V-day. It&#39;s a very quaint and cozy place. It&#39;s BYOB. They have a great price point with a great ambiance perfect for a date or a group with your friends.	1
I love the atmosphere in this place. The walls are painted a warm yellow color. There are plenty of books and magazines to read . Its very cozy. My favorite is the music that they have play live sometimes. Food is very good.	1
I mean, the burgers here are great, they're cooked juicy, fragrant, and my favorite is the umami burger (duh.) and I am in love with the condiments, but the REAL winning combo here is the food AND service. I got Edgar as my server, and he is the DEFINITION OF CUSTOMER SERVICE.I had made plans to meet here with my girl friend, and I sat and sat and sat and sat ... and waited for 1.5 HOURS. Edgar would come by to check on me (cus I was obvi a mega loner) and refilled my water and said, "Still waiting huh?" Then when I REALLY couldn't stand it anymore, I went ahead and ordered my burger. Then suddenly, when Edgar brought me my Umami Burger (and a side of fries), I had a guilt trip and decided to not eat until my friend got there. 15 minutes later, she still hadn't arrived and Edgar took notice, came by, and told me that he would take my burger and give me a freshhhhh one because the original one had gotten cold and he said it wouldn't taste as good. oh & he even scolded my friend for being super late when she finally arrived. puahaha! CONCLUSION: EDGAR DESERVES A FAT A$$ TIP MORE THAN YOUR FAV STRIPPER DOES (even if she HAS a phat a$$)!!! Get the umami burger, thin fries, try the garlic aioli sauce with your fries, if you're looking to add some tummy rolls, order an ice cream sandwich (they're from MILK, delicious) and expect excellent service. :)I like the decor at the La Brea location better, but I would def come back here just for the great service.	1
aaaah, what a disappointment! id heard so much about this place and was completely unimpressed. nothing on the menu caught my attention so i shared some oysters, smoked fish salad and the clam stew. the oysters were awesome..but i mean, they can&#39;t really get credit for that, they&#39;re raw. there was nothing special about the salad and the clam stew was actually creamy potato soup with a couple of clams placed on top -no clams throughout! none of the food was actually bad..but nothing to be desired, especially for the price. Would never recommend it.	0
The food was good but the service was AWFUL!! I mean AWFUL !! I will never go back again. I was with my mother and cousin. It was around 5pm on a Thursday. Just the beginning of dinner time. We were sat right away at a pretty nice table when some goofy looking guy came over and told us we were sat in the wrong section. He apologized then moved us to a very congested loud area. He appeased us by giving us shots that we didn&#39;t want. Our waitress seemed to be really high on something. It took forever for us to get anything we ordered including water. The experience got worse but I don&#39;t even want to go into it. Needless to say, I will not recommend this joint to anyone I know.	0
This Place Is Awful. When You Walk In, You Can Tell The Place is Dirty. The Walls and Windows Need To Be Cleaned. The Service Is Prompt But Over Priced. My Mom Ordered One Pancaked, One Sausage, And Two Eggs. The Waiter Messed Up The Ordered And Charged Almost Double. I Ordered The Chenery Scramble, It was Tasteless, Needed Salt, Th Onions Were Cut Way To Big. The So called Country Potatoes Were semi Mashed and Sliced, Not Cubed, And They Had NO SALT, NO FLAVOR. I Do Not Recommend This Place, Go Across The Street For A Better Experience.	0
After several attempts, I have determined that the horrible service here is a fixture. It's astounding that they have the same ownership as Epic, which has WONDERFUL service...but there it is. I'll not go here again, even if invited to join friends.	0
Coworkers decided to eat out and take a longer lunch than usual while all the bosses were away at a convention. Walking around we found ourselves here and decided to go with it since we were hungry. It's an interesting space, hidden from the street and looks like it mainly serves the people that have boats docked nearby. It was a bit awkward trying to get seated...If you've ever walked into an establishment and found yourself not knowing who a server was and afraid to stop someone in fear you might offend them for assuming they worked here--it was that type of situation. No sense of uniform (when we sat down and were able to observe who was a server) We saw some girls chitchatting, and one with aviator glasses finally stepped up as asked how many were in our group. She sat us at a table with an umbrella, which was greatly needed. Luckily we seemed to arrive just before the lunch rush, as we saw people waiting towards the end of our meal.WHAT I HAD/SHARED with coworkers:- Chips, Salsa & Guacamole ($8.00): PASS! The guacamole had WAY too much lime juice so it was just too acidic. Salsa was nothing special either. Not worth the $8- Fried Calamari with tartar & cocktail sauce ($12.00): Probably the best part of the meal. Tasty and crispy legs and calamari rings. This was great!-Oysters on the Half Shell ($1 each during some happy hour promotion): The mignonette/vinaigrette they served it wasn't that great. The oysters were so-so and somewhat small. Meh.Coworkers had a beet salad and cups of clam chowder. Can't vouch for what they said about it.SERVICE:Aside from not knowing who servers were initially, service was just alright. Food and drinks came fairly quickly, but that was about it. What bothered me is when I went to go ask for change and I followed the waitress into the bar area to ask the bartender to make change. It just seemed like a huge inconvenience to them. I'm sorry I'd rather have small bills to make exact change instead of asking you to split the bill 4 ways on 4 credit cards?Whatever. Wont be back anytime soon.	0
Food and drink were above the usual. Although this restaurant is located on the Monte Carlo casino floor, the restaurant is elegant and you feel totally removed from the outside environment. Great service. Pre-order the souffle of grand marnier and chocolate - it is so yummy. The price is worth the experience.	1
The service was very personable, the food was very delicious, and the ambiance was intriguing; however, the food descriptions on the menu were vague and the portion sizes were much too small. I think every New York restaurant should strive to find a balance between quality, portion size and price.	0
Food is great, however very inconsistent in presentation and portions. Sending it back is customary	0
Great atmosphere, love the outside patio area. Perfect for a night out in LA with friends. Food is always delicious, love the ceviches and salmon sashimi. Very friendly servers and the cocktails are really good!!	1
Went to Vegas for the weekend and came across this very cool hot dog cart. These were the best hot dogs I ever had! yum	1
I really like this local spot. Food is great, service is great and its nice to eat delicious food. Try the banana cream pie! Its to die for!!!	1
This review is for the Dockside section of Playa Provisions (the seafood restaurant). The restaurant is in a really awesome location near the beach and the ambience is sort of &#34;casual hip&#34;. We were sat in the covered patio which had a really cool vibe and it smelled pleasantly like the wood in a sauna. However the food didn&#39;t impress me at all. <br><br>Our table ordered quite a bit of food to try. Here&#39;s the lowdown...<br><br>Appetizers<br>$18 Oyster/Uni shooters..highly don&#39;t recommend unless you really want to spend the money. That&#39;s practically the price of an entree, and it was sooooo small (maybe a tablespoon size) and really not spectacular for that price. <br>Clam-something? Our friend ordered it so I&#39;m not even sure what it was. I think it was some sort of clam type bake (6 half-shell clams), but they were covered with breadcrumbs and tiny pieces of chopped up seafood (?). Really couldn&#39;t tell what it was or taste anything. <br>Calamari...nothing special. Deep fried, tiny, and kind of boring. <br>Ceviche...best thing about this dish were the taro chips. But the ceviche itself? Meh...<br><br>Entrees<br>Beet salad...this was actually pretty good. They don&#39;t skimp on beets. I was surprised. But they had roasted or deep fried garbanzo beans, but they tasted more oily than anything.<br>Wedge salad...it looked good. <br>Clam chowder in a bowl....boston style and nothing special<br>Whole chicken...this was a really good size. My friend did say he enjoyed it. <br>Sea Scallops...tiny and unimpressive. It looked like it was an appetizer size! It sat on a little rectangle of &#34;cornbread pudding&#34; that was really thin (like a thick pancake), but also seemed oily or just greasy.<br>Seafood Louis Salad...another uninteresting dish. It was supposed to come with Qunioa but it did not. Tiny piece of avocado. <br>Grilled Shetland Salmon...this did look pretty good. Probably the best bet on the menu (along with the beet salad).<br><br>Dessert:<br>Some sort of icecream eggnog cake. This was probably the best thing on the menu. It was really light and airy. Didn&#39;t seem heavy at all. Drizzled in caramel and some sort of cookie crust.<br><br>All in all, although I was REALLY wanting to like this restaurant I just didn&#39;t. It doesn&#39;t compare even close to Tripel (same owners) and although the space is really cool, I can&#39;t justify spending that kind of money on sub-par but really pricey food. Maybe one day I&#39;ll try the cafe but with Cafe Milan around the corner, I&#39;d rather spend my money there...	0
17 dollars for Basil Shrimp with bacon bits over rice?<br><br>5 dollars for a small container of tomato garlic fried rice.<br><br>15 dollars for curry chicken.<br><br>The food tastes okay. It was over priced for what it is to the point of price gorging. For example, you will do better with the curry chicken at any of your Chinatown or Flushing establishments. It will taste better, gets you fuller, comes with rice, for half the price. You also dont have to go out of your way to get it.<br><br>Over all, I spend 70 for take out. I can easily get the same for 20 at any other dining establishments.	0
Limited parking. Relaxing atmosphere. Knowledgeable and friendly staff. Food is delicious!!!!!!	1
I ate at Olive&#39;s in NYC and gave it 2 stars but the LV-Olives is even worse! Our waiter was retarded: he messedup the order at least 3 times. He was so confused. We ordered the flat bread and it came with no cheese and it wasnt cooked. WTF? What a big disappointment. Once again, nice decor, okay service and good drinks = big bill. im dont like these &#34;new-American&#34; eateries. The food is so dull every time.	0
Toasted marshmallow shakes, a dipping bar with mango mayo, and farmhouse burgers?! How is this the same Spike Mendehlson from Top Chef Season 4?!<br><br>I wasn&#39;t a fan of Spike when I watched Top Chef but granted he had tough competition against Stephanie Izard and Richard Blais. This was years ago and now Spike shows that he has come a long way with Good Stuff Eatery located just blocks away from Millennium Park. For the average price of $7 a burger, I can see why Good Stuff Eatery&#39;s burgers are receiving so much praise. <br><br>At first glance, the burger looks about the size of a double cheeseburger at McDonalds. What you don&#39;t notice is that more than half the weight is the burger patty itself. It&#39;s about an inch in thickness - that&#39;s some girth for you. The meat is cooked to medium where each bite will require a napkin from the juices. Indulge yourself with fries and a mini shake for only $6 more since it&#39;s totally worth it. You&#39;ll need fries for the dipping bar where you can try each of the mayos (sriracha, mango, chipotle, and bay flavored). With flavors like Milky Way Malt, Red Velvet, and Vietnamese Coffee, you can&#39;t pass up their hand spun shakes. <br><br>That&#39;s some damn good stuff. Hats off to you, Chef Spike.	1
This place is usually pretty good, so I just hate to share on one bad experience. <br><br>Yeah, I get it...the staff is supposed to have the &#34;I&#39;m-too-cool-for-school&#34; or even &#34;I&#39;m-too-cool-for-a-haircut&#34; kind of vibe, but there&#39;s a limit as to how much disdain and attitude one can take. The woman bartender on this particular day (dark hair, with a &#34;let&#39;s ride tattoo&#34;) was just too grumpy to be around other human beings. Suck it up, chick! We all have bad days, so your negativity is just not welcomed! I wanted to walk over and give her a hug! <br><br>In any other day, this place would be a nice location to lift up your mood. After today, I just felt bad for her and highly disappointed.	0
Meh, typical late night diner place, always with lines of people the later it gets. Food is very bland and mediocre, but serves to the nearby crowd of Silver Lake and Los Feliz. Take what you will about the type of people that may frequent such a place.A bit overpriced for the type of food you get. I do appreciate the variety they try to incorporate though, from breakfast to tacos/burritos to asian soups to hamburgers, chili and desserts. Umm... in the same vein I'm not sure if I can really trust a place that claims to try to deliver all of those at 3am. Hrm.	0
food was good, SERVICE WAS HORRIFIC!!!!! who waits 15 minutes for the waitress to come greet you and 45 minutes to get a check???? it was ridiculous! when they decide to retrain their waitresses...i'd come back...but for now...no thanks i'd rather go to a college bar and get better service.	0
It was nice out, we were hungry, so we decided to hit up downtown. I figured the Tom Douglas block of restaurants would be a good area of choice. I wanted to hit up Serious Pie, but my girlfriend wanted to try somewhere different, so we walked over to Lola. It's a very nice restaurant connected to a hotel, friendly waitstaff, nice ambiance, etc. There's not much on the breakfast/lunch menu for carnivores like ourselves, but we did end up with the Lamb Burger and the Shawarma. I hate to say it but the burger was just okay. I say just okay because it was juicy and cooked perfectly but it just lacked any sort of flavor. It was a plain burger with grilled red onion, peppers and lettuce. The chickpea fries that came with the burger was the highlight of the entire dish. They were quite good and might I add, innovative. Chef Tom Douglas wins points for creativity. My girlfriend said she enjoyed her Shawarma, which I had a bite of and thought was pretty good. The unfortunate part was that it was her meal and not mine. I would have to say that the overall experience was just okay. We both discussed that for the price of the food at Lola, we could have ate like kings (or in her case, a queen) at one of our usual hole in the wall restaurants. Oh well, you win some you lose some.	1
Four Cafe is a recent addition to Fairfax (replacing Black Cat). I know their original Eagle Rock location is pretty popular so wanted to try it out.<br><br>I ordered the warm fall salad and it was delicious! The salad consists of spinach, arugula, goat cheese, candied pecans, mushrooms and butternut squash. It&#39;s topped with a pomegranate vinaigrette, which tastes very similar to balsamic vinaigrette. This is a rather sweet salad, but the goat cheese is a nice contrast. About halfway through the salad though, it did start feeling very heavy. I ordered the half portion ($7.50), which is a decent size. <br><br>I also tried the iced coconut green tea. I&#39;ve never had anything like this before. The green tea is infused with a very strong coconut flavor so if you&#39;re not a fan of coconut, stay away. <br><br>Four Cafe has a very clean and green feel to it. I like the healthier food options it provides and it&#39;s a great choice for vegetarians/vegans. If you&#39;re unable to find street parking, there&#39;s a parking lot available as well.	1
Can not go wrong with the manly burger, ever. Not ever. But if you are feeling a bit more daring, ask for the others, the wildest one might be the lamb burger yet it is awesome and totally not gamie(musty,stanky,wildanimaltaste)what can I say I love you UMAMI Just, please get me some Guniess on Tap Or Hoegaarden	1
We decided on a whim to finally eat here and are very happy we did. Food was wonderful and service relaxed but impeccable.	1
Have ad over the last year a few meals here. Always great service and good food.Had the Cobb Salad today while my associates had the club sandwich and garden salad.Have had breakfast here a few times and always a good experience. Clean place..friendly servers and awesome location.Will be back!	1
To be quite honest, I didnt really enjoy eating at this place. 1. Although the taste of the food was pretty good, the noodles were too undercooked - not even al dente.2. You had to pay a separate fee for a bowl of rice.. and the rice was also too undercooked, where the middle of the grain was still hard and crunchy.3. The service was not really there. When my friend asked if he should try the marco polo or the korean noodle soup, the waitress suggested the marco polo. However, her only reason was that the korean noodle soup... was noodle soup.. UMMM WHAT..? Also, waiters should come around refilling your water every once in a while, but when this waiter brought out the water, he only refilled half of the table's water.. ONLY HALF WAY.. I believe it was because he saw our check there. but everyone was thirsty (you could tell because everyone's water was empty).. Overall, I would say this place is decent, but definitely not authentic asian food.. It seems like one of those places that you see Sheldon (from the Big Bang Theory) ordering American-ized Chinese take-out from.	0
Cooked to perfection. Ordered the Kansas strip bone in, requested Pittsburg style medium rare. The steak came out with a nice dark brown crust all the way around. Almost like a crispy Shell. The outside was seasoned well with salt, pepper and other spices. When I cut the steak it was crunchy on the outside and with a layer of grey than light to moderate red meat. The taste was phenomenal. I would highly recommend this for any Pittlsburg style connoisseurs.	1
Awesome place. Good songs! Nice and clean rooms! And very nice staff! I always come here. It&#39;s better than all the other karaoke places in town. They update their list monthly. I&#39;m about to bust out in some Disney songs. :3	1
I love smoked food. I have my own Big Green Egg; my boss has two of them, and together, we kick out some mean smoked proteins. It's also spoiled me, as I am usually disappointed by most restaurants that serve smoked foods.	0
I hate to be a party pooper, but I will be honest about this place. My girlfriend and I came to this place on a Friday night and our lady server was very inconsiderate and did not help us at all. After getting seated, I had to literally get up and find her to get our order after waiting for 15 minutes without anyone to help us. <br><br>After that, it just got worse. She did not bring the side dishes until another 10 minutes later and did not offer to help cook the meat (not to mention she placed the meat behind our table so I had to move the meat table myself). It&#39;s little things like this..<br><br>I had to ask her to bring the rice and broth, which were supposed to be included with the combo meal. The meat was not marinated (which I do not like) and was not good quality. Just brisket and chicken. Plus, I had to get up and ask for our side dishes to get refilled too.<br><br>It was not a busy night when we came either at 5pm so I do not see the problem. Quite the horrible experience and will not come back again. There are better services and kbbq elsewhere..	0
I was just dying to like this place more than I did. The vegan pizza was great. Good quality ingredients well-executed. The vegan chopped salad was not worth the price of chewing. No onions? Pepperoncini? I shoulda ordered the beet kale salad. The waiter told me the veggie burger was vegan, but thinking back, all the other stuff was explicitly labeled vegan. If I ever go back, I will ask more than one person. <br><br>At the end we tried to add on a quick dessert for my 8-year-old kid, but we decided to leave when that didn&#39;t come after about 20 minutes. Not exactly what I needed to be doing with my time, especially after waiting quite a while for the food. When we saw the waiter on the way out, he was like &#34;You got your dessert, right?&#34; Which is what you say when you know the customer didn&#39;t get their dessert. I was like, &#34;No. And we just have to go now.&#34; He was like, &#34;I&#39;m sorry. The kitchen is just really backed up.&#34; It was around 6 pm and the place was a third full. I&#39;d hate to see how they handle it when they are actually full.<br><br>I know waiting tables sucks cuz I&#39;ve done it plenty. No little kid is sitting there thinking, &#34;I want to be a waiter/waitress when I grow up.&#34; I think the waiter is a good guy and the organizational issues here are management&#39;s problem. Hire adequate staff and empower the other staff to work a teeny bit out of their job description. Manager, if you are slammed, grab the water pitcher and start filling glasses, or something else that involves getting up and moving through the restaurant. I gave the waiter a nice juicy tip and I sure hope the manager did not get to skim that.	0
I really enjoyed the calamari and the yellow homemade sauce it came with. I also liked the Pisco punch which was just sweet and tart and very chilled. The presentation of the food is beautiful and clean. I liked the music they played there and the decor was modern Peruvian, black with woods. I live up the street and I'm glad I no longer have to travel far to have a good drink and meal. I highly recommend this place for groups and first dates. Oh it's a lovely place.	1
I was here for a late Valentine's Day dinner with my boyfriend. The service was a bit slow given the packed condition of the dining room. We ordered chicha moradas (non-alcoholic drink made out of purple corn juice, tastes like sangria but with juice instead of wine) and the ceviche mixto to start. The ceviche was amazing...I wish I had ordered that for my entree. It had squid, mussels, crab leg, and fish all swimming around in a tart and spicy juice marinade.	0
Service Fail: We waited while three tables seated after us got food... and waited... then asked to speak to the manager. She went to &#34;check on the kitchen&#34; and we never saw her again. Maybe she got lost, or the chef threw her in the pot?<br><br>Don&#39;t know if our server, who seemed pretty good from the start, forgot to put in our order or what. No apology or explanation, just the tip portion of the bill crossed out, which is weird cause we still would have tipped him something.<br><br>Bloody Mary was delicious as was the rest of our breakfast food. Steak &amp; Eggs ftw. Aunt Jemima makes the pancakes, but that pecan butter rocks. <br><br>I normally don&#39;t review a place after one bad experience and I&#39;d probably give it another try if I lived in the area, but I found the management&#39;s customer service exceptionally lame.	0
Unpretentious, low key bar right on Atlantic Ave.<br><br>Love the tin ceiling, booth seats and shelves with real books (yes, real!). There is also room on the back with more seatings and backyard, but it was reserved the night we were there, so I could not check it out. <br><br>They have TV for all you sport fans!<br><br>Good beer selection. Food is simple, but pretty great. Fries were good, and BLT was very, very nicely put together - perfectly toasted bread, thick-cut bacon, fresh tomatoes - delish!!! <br><br>Now, someone please, please tell me the meaning of abbreviation on the mirror??? I will love you forever if you do!	1
Yes, great location but what a bunch of stuck up people...if you have a stick up in your ass then enjoy!<br>Didnt like the atmosphere neither the service...	0
Food is good. Service sucks. "Oh um, sushi we might be out of certain things, let me check on that". Comes back makes no mention of sushi like the question never happened. This was our second time back and it was the same story. The servers they have just don't seem to know how to wait tables. Too bad because the food is pretty good.	0
My party of five came in on Saturday for dinner and drinks. I picked this restaurant without knowing much about it. We were heading to a nearby bar after dinner so I thought I would give it a shot based on reviews and the menu. We were promptly seated, even though we were early for our reservation and the entire party hadn&#39;t arrived.<br><br>The service was great, our waitress was efficient and attentive. Our food was timely, as were our drinks. We didn&#39;t feel rushed, nor did we feel we were waiting too long for anything. <br><br>The veggie burger was delicious! I&#39;m planning on coming back again to try more items on the food menu. <br><br>The cocktail list is creative and fun; an interesting mix of flavors offered. Apparently it is somewhat BYOB as well, they accept wine but charge a $15 corkage fee since they have a full bar. We decided to try the cocktails instead of bring a bottle of wine and were very happy with our decision. The cocktails are great. <br><br>The ambiance was wonderful; comfortable, yet classy and modern. I was very happy with this pick for my group dinner. Also, when the check arrived, we noticed it was itemized and arranged by seat number, so we were able to easily figure out how much we each needed to contribute. That&#39;s pretty handy when getting one large check for a group. <br><br>I would happily come again with a group or on a date. We were all very satisfied!	1
3 oysters + water + a minuscule curry appetizer (size of a contact lens) = $65.<br><br>Certainly will not return unless I win the lottery or develop an eating disorder (both unlikely) <br><br>I don&#39;t recommend patronizing this establishment unless you are a glutton for punishment, not food.	0
LOVELY setting if that&#39;s your ish. Been here 2x and both were solid nice experiences<br><br>1) Jazzy live music, comfortable couches. You can dress to the 9s or just plain Jane, but the atmosphere is def chic. We made reservations 1 week prior and were seated in the outdoor patio overloooking the Pershing Square Rink. <br><br>We had the bunny frou frou, scallops, gnocchi, and poutine. Now its been a while but I remember liking the gnocchi and poutine. We also basically tried everything on the dessert menu and we were overall satisfied with dinner but even more, loved the experience and our knowledgeable server, but you&#39;re basically paying the good bucks for the view<br><br>2) Came out for a boys night to check out the LA night lights. It was past midnight on a Saturday and there was still maybe a good 30 min wait total from outside the building to the two elevators to the final staircase leading to the lounge upstairs<br><br>Not too cramped but no seats either. Crowd was pretty mature but the situation was lively. And then you&#39;ve got the view, so who can complain... certainly the bouncer who was trying to get me off the ledge	1
Perfect restaurant! Lovely atmosphere, great svc by all, yummy food, and it's tucked away off the street which, once inside, makes u feel like u found a secret little spot in a treehouse lol. I recommend everyone go and give it a chance! I'm glad I did, I'll be back.	1
Was here last night for dinner. WHOA. It was awesome. The food was delicious. My sister and I did the Sunday special $26/person and you get 2 entrees, a spectacular salad, a couple sides and dessert. Seriously. I get less food at Starbucks for $17. Everything was healthy and yum. Lots of veggies and the brussel sprouts were to die for! It was so good I asked for them to make me the entire thing for 2 people to go so my husband and I do not have to cook for a few days. It was that good.	1
Mariella is my favorite new restaurant in the neighborhood! The owner introduced himself and befriended us, the crazy ass server from Montenegro always chats with us and is super friendly and even sometimes gives us free dessert! And I think the $$$ rating is too high. The prices here are really quite reasonable. <br><br>And the food............... MMMMMMMMMMMM........................	1
When the assistant manager sets an example by dressing properly, acting appropriately, and looking enthusiastic, the red headed floor manager should do the same and should be expected to follow suit, instead of constantly going into the kitchen and digging into his right rear pocket in search of his sell phone. He clearly wasn't in touch with the buzz of the restaurant. He didn't even appear to be interested. Instead looked bored and seemed as if he didn't want to be there. The food fell below expectations. With a good attempt to mimic comparable restaurants, the kitchen wasn't able to meet the bar. The pork belly didn't resemble it's name. Instead, it as tough, not sweetened enough as any pork dish should be and ultimately very distasteful. I highly suggest the chef seek alternate methods of cooking such a dish. Compliments to the assistant manager for looking the part, acting the part and appearing to at least be in charge. However, the appearance of he red headed manager must equal or surpass that of the assistant manager. It was embarrassing.	1
The meat is not fresh, it was chewy and the rice is pre cooked! - I don&#39;t recommend this place. On top of that, the waiter was very rude.	0
My first yelp review and unfortunately it is a negative one. My first time here &amp; had a WORM in my arugula veggie pizza! They made adjustments on the bill but being a non pesticide eater, this was not acceptable at all!! I would have missed the green little dude if it wasn&#39;t for him crawling up/being alive. Manager said we use all &#34;organic produce&#34; but it is questionable if they check or wash their fresh &#34;organic&#34; greens. I will never go here again!!!	0
Another wonderful dining experience, start to finish. Beautiful service and great food.	1
There&#39;s something odd going on in Wynwood. Some nights, in some places, in some dark corners and down some dark alleys, Wynwood is still its old self. Still a pocket of breathable air in an otherwise endless sea of neon and painted-on pants and Botox and awful f*cking scotch watered down by way too many ice cubes.<br><br>Other nights, in other places, in other corners marked by long lines and the clicking of shiny shoes made for work or funerals, you see skin made purple by clothes so tight, they might mean the end of testicles and ovaries and the human race as we know it. You see drinks that are more lemon and cranberry and soda water than vodka. You see hordes of women wearing heels so high that the ringing in your ears from the droning house music is broken only by the sound of ankles snapping and ligaments popping.<br><br>And most nights, in most places, you see that Wynwood makes strange bedfellows. You see outsiders mingling with trendsetters. You see PBR tall boys and Moscow Mules. You see Jameson neats and Red Bull anythings. And it&#39;s not so bad. It&#39;s actually OK. It&#39;s like species of human coming together, only instead of ending in bloodshed and evolution-altering genocide, it ends with peaceful coexistence and the occasional coital crossover.<br><br>Brick House is one of these places: a bright light attracting your run-of-the-mill mosquitoes and the kind of flying menaces that&#39;ll haunt you for the rest of your life.<br><br>With cheap drinks (you can get a vodka whatever, a shot of Jameson, and a Narragansett tall boy for under ten bucks during happy hour), wildly varied music (from the oldest, most wonderful of hip hop to the existentially curious music you might&#39;ve heard at Soho Lounge all those years ago to deep house), games, and a modest food menu, on a given night, you&#39;ll see the masses in all their highly-varied glory playing Connect Four and Cards Against Humanity and fondling each other under picnic tables.<br><br>And it&#39;s a pretty cool thing to see.<br><br>My only advice? Dress cool. Because it&#39;s open-air, it&#39;s a breeding ground for monkey butt.<br><br>Just saying, Brick House. Just saying.	1
I work nearby and place regular delivery orders but recently found two bugs in my Chicken Caesar Salad !!!!!! Won&#39;t be ordering again - especially since the food quality seems to be getting worse	0
The food was very spicy and abundant - 2 things I love in a Mexican restaurant! The joint is jumping though, so you may have to be patient if it takes a little while to get your dinner. The margaritas are great and enormous. I recommend the angry calamari. The wait staff was a lot fun too.	1
Co-Chefs and owners Nick Roberts and Brooke Williamson are ahead of the curve. A beautiful space turned multi concept restaurant, 4 in 1 to be exact. Ambitious you say? Genius is more like it! Following in the footsteps of their two previous and already legendary establishments Hudson House (Redondo Beach) and The Tripel (Playa Del Rey) Playa Provisions offers both wonderful food and beverages. Playa Provisions is a place where you could spend an entire day. Breakfast and lunch served at the more casual King Beach side which offers soups, sandwiches, salads and bakery items paired with their ice cream shop Small Batch were every flavor is made in house. King Beach offers Brunch on the weekends too! For dinner the evermore spacious Dockside where you can find a bar with great drinks, eclectic seafood dishes and featured specials without limits and delicious desserts. Cap it all off, throw a few back and let loose at Grain their in house Whiskey Bar. A plethora of whiskey to choose from.	1
The only thing this place has going for it is they're open late. We came here around 11 one night, there was only 1 server and 1 bus boy working. We waited about 20 minutes with our menus closed before the waiter finally took our order. Got less than average burgers/ BLT for ten bucks each. Not worth it.	0
If 10 stars were possible to award, this would be one of the few places that I would give the honor to. This place is beyond phenomenal. The service, atmosphere, and most importantly, food was ON POINT. The place is hard to find as there is no visible signage on the ground floor. Now on to the food and drinks. They have SO MUCH WHISKEY. My friend ordered a Gold Rush (some bourbon honey concoction) which was by far the BEST bourbon drink I have ever had hands down. I ordered the beef brisket with horseradish sauce. What the holy heck. I felt like I was transported to an alternate universe where beef marinates for days and smokers are on all the time. I, of course, dug into my friends' plates - I have zero shame. The smoked chicken was amazing - I have never had chicken so succulent and smoky. The lamb sloppy joe was also solid. Call ahead to order the Beast Feast which looked AMAZING - what I would do to live in Seattle and have this place in my backyard!	1
Tried to go but the wait was 4 hours on Sunday	0
Totally love the food and beer!!!	1
Still good but the quality and the service appear to be on the decline. Both used to be above average.	0
Everyone take a deep breath. We are Roy Choi fans. We love the risks he takes, his vibe and style. So we finally got to POT, despite some of the reviews here. Got there earlyish 6:15p on a Monday and no wait. Cool design of the place and tables. Service was excellent all the way. Provided aprons and if you eat like me, use them! Had to try the Beep Beep after all of the hype. It was unusual and classic Choi, incredible fusion of tastes and textures. It is a smaller portion for two perfect. Went OLD SCHOOL on the pot and it was bulgogi with a kick and a bit salty, but with rice very good. The baby octopus salad appetizer was amazing, In hindsight would go with 4-8 people to share. For two this place is more like $$$. Can not compare this to traditional Korean food. This is Choi's take. We will be back with a gang.	1
This was my second time here and both times have been great. Pan Roasted Chicken and Pork chop were both very good. The food has been good enough to make me want to come back a third and possibly more times. Service was also good although I felt I waited a lil long for my chop. I'd recommend making reservations because they always have a full house. If you don't you might have to sit at a "shared table" with others and there really isn't anywhere to sit and wait inside. If you want to try great food and don't mind a lot of chatter this is a great place. Oh and I don't think they have a parking lot so valet is $3.50.	1
Best samgyetang in LA! Would give it. 5 star rating if they had more options but I am just happy for such a great restaurant.. Good food and great service!	1
Simply the best when you want delicious food! I visit Toast at least 3 times per week. I suggest the onion rings, the fries, mediteranian salad and the bmt. Also, the busiest times always produce your order quickest. It&#39;s great people watching too. Everyone used to go there super casual and now people come dressed like Jonahs brothers and Lady Gaga.	1
My experience with New York is a lot of hit and miss restaurants. When your looking around for some good grub and just decide to go out on a leap and walk in you could lose money on below average dishes.<br><br>At G&amp;G this was not the case.<br><br>Great food, which seemed to be made from scratch with fresh produce! I&#39;ve never had a better chicken parm sandwich and by God the pasta was delish. I advice to try the iced tea and their wine recommendations. Just yum!<br><br>Staff was really nice, Julio treated us well and I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll do the same with you. Check this place out, it&#39;s just great!	1
I was pleasantly delighted with my first experience here. The woman ringing me up was very nice and friendly and the service was really quick! I ordered the tomato soup and the quinoa salad. Both tasted delicious and clean. The tomato soup wasn't creamy, which was a nice change.The condiment bar was my a favorite! They had Nutella!!	1
Greasy and over cooked. Lines are forever, but the place gave me indigestion both times I went. Better place next door.	0
Co workers raved about this place. I don&#39;t see anything particularly special about it. What I ordered made my stomach flip in knots and it also didn&#39;t taste good going down altogether. It was their own rendition of hockey Parmesan and I didn&#39;t like the mayo based sauce that was used. I do want to try there thanksgiving dish I heard it is good. But after that first order I&#39;ve never ordered again.	0
OK, if you love gorumet hamburgers, have a couple extra bucks and want the ability to seriously customize your burger (from the sauces, type of bread, toppings, etc.) then this is the place for you. Upscale casual (wear whatever...but it's LA so that's a given), trendy but with good, approachable servers and fairly easy parking on week night evenings....My burger was very good; I was able to have it cooked very rare due to the quality and freshness of the beef (a big plus about the Counter) and there were options to make it spicy which is another big plus for me. The fries were nothing special. Great place to try if you're a burger aficionado.	1
La Goulette feels like great and authentic Tunisian food prepared by people who really care about quality and authenticity. I have been a few times since they opened a few weeks back and all food I have tried has been great in flavor. I noticed a lot of people keep coming back (as will I).	1
Suprising that for a salad place, they have little in the way for a vegan option. Apparently they have a non-compete wtih Capriotti's so I wasn't able to order their vegan cheesesteak or get a salad from them and had to visit SC for my meal.	0
Don&#39;t waste your time coming here with a big party. They will make u wait hours. I came here with a party of 8 and they told us the wait was about 1 hr but we ended up waiting for more than 2 and a half hrs. The place is poorly managed, the hostess was giving out tables and so were the waiters. My party was suppose to get a table like an hour ago but one of the waiter just gave our table away to another party without even asking the hostess or checking the wait list. These waiters need to go through some serious training again.	0
This was my first time eating Indian food. It was so good I am sorry I waited so long. The Moghul Palace was recommended by friends and it didn't disappoint. They had meatballs and the Tindoori (I think) and I had a pepper/ tomato dish (sorry I don't remember the name) but it was great. The owner was very nice and willing to discuss the intricacies of his recipes.	1
When you first walk into far bar, it might look sketchy because you&#39;re walking through a little alley. Once you&#39;re in though, this place has nice outdoor seating where there&#39;s usually a band playing. the bar inside has a wide selection of cocktails and Japanese beers. My favorite drink is the flaming lambo, which you definitely be surprised if you order it. (You&#39;ll see what I mean if you order it). They also have small tapas which is decent, but not the best. Overall this place is nice to go with a couple friends for drinks.	1
I love absolutely everything at Gather. It feels cozy and classy at the same time. Staff is always extremely friendly and helpful when trying to make difficult decisions about what to order- everything on the menu sounds amazing! I&#39;ve been here a few times for dinner and also for brunch and have never been disappointed. It&#39;s the type of place where you spend time talking with the people at your table about how good the food is, over and over again.	1
Stopped on a whim and was pretty sad I did. The atmosphere is nice, decent lunch crowd going. The spinach artichoke app was good and included carrots and celery which was nice. Looking to eat light we got a mandarin salad and a beef wrap. Neither were anything to write home about. Onion rings were winners as well as $2 screwdriver special.	0
Called ahead to get reservations for a birthday and asked about dessert option presentation for a birthday.<br><br>They told me they had a metal cake.<br><br>With fireworks coming out of it.<br><br>What is this...<br><br>Luna Park has a great intimate and fun feel to it. I got the Volcano Scorpion bowl and a warm chocolate cake with chocolate ice cream.<br><br>Working out with the hostess on how to sneak in the surprise cake was fun. The people were very nice and attentive, with great attention to detail. When the cake came out, it looked gloriously scary - in the best way possible.<br><br>Didn&#39;t have the chance to try their other food though, just had dessert and drinks.<br><br>The chocolate cake was so soft and warm - the perfect bite with some ice cream on it. The scorpion bowl was big, with a shot light on fire upon presentation. Strong and sweet drink. Could have finished it, but had to drive safely.<br><br>AND - after all this trouble, they took my expired Living Social coupon! I asked about it and they said that they don&#39;t believe in the expiration dates. AWESOME!<br><br>Great service. Fun people. Romantic atmosphere. metered and valet parking.	1
This is a great hamburger, beer place. Good food with a view.	1
Great tortas and excellent service! The family that runs his business is really friendly and truly loves this business. The 4 dollar beers were delicious and they had my favorite craft beer on tap. Well done.	1
Yes!!!! I&#39;ve literally waited my whole life for a GOOD coffee shop to open up in my neighborhood. The lattes were DELICIOUS. The quality of the espresso were PERFECTTTTTT. Thanks for the great drinks and hope to try everything else on the menu!	1
Get their 3 tacos deal with a drink for $4.99.<br>They have happy hour on Tuesdays after 2pm.<br><br>This place has friendly service.. very friendly, imo :).<br>Potato&#39;s not bad. I like their fish and beef tacos.	1
A souped up Spanish omelet, a different but dry fig and pepper scone and the average cup of Joe from a very above average looking bakery is the basis of this review... But as first impressions go, I was disappointed with the more accessible but less impressive of the two Izard establishments on Randolph.<br>This is certainly no average diner menu.. there is a certain universal appeal to the creative &#34; cereal killers&#34; list - kimchee, paratha, rich pancake variations offer up some promising fusion possibilities, but it does make for a bit of a pricey profusion of scattered options especially if one is looking for a typical early Saturday vegetarian brunch.<br>The wait was expected, bread and people watching at the adjoining bakery is a great way to wait for your turn! My friend and I got a great spot at a sun drenched booth on the far end of the diner - very glad that the typical diner ambiance wasn&#39;t kept true to form!<br>It was not entirely a case of much ado about nothing but there certainly was less fire than I expected underneath all that smokey buzz!	0
I arrived for brunch in order to grab some photographs for work. While I waited for my main dishes to come out, I chatted with the bartenders and photographed some delightful mid-morning cocktails. They tasted as good as they looked. <br><br>The bloody mary was spicy, the mimosa tasted wonderful with a fresh-pressed orange juice. When the dishes arrived, the photographed beautifully, but tasted better. I indulged in the best steak of my life. Perfectly season and paired with crispy potatoes, bell peppers and onions. It was a lovely, lovely breakfast. I definitely recommend Rays &amp; Stark Bar.	1
I love their iced soy lattes and their homemade poptart pastries. <br><br>the location has a great vibe if you want to go and enjoy a latte and people watch, but our favorite thing to do is to walk there, grab a latte to go and enjoy our pastry (or pastries!) once we get home :)	1
As loathe as I am to give poor &amp; mediocre reviews when I can&#39;t really fault the experience... I&#39;m convinced I would rate Morgan&#39;s higher if it was the first Texas-style BBQ I&#39;d had. Alas, I&#39;ve only been to a few such places in NYC, but the food was significantly better elsewhere. Especially given what we paid (about $80 for two). The brisket we ordered came out kind of... cold. We told the waitress and she had it warmed up. The pulled pork was a bit cold too, but at that point we couldn&#39;t be bothered and just ate it. They had some kind of pinto beans side, no southern-style baked beans in sight, which were kind of bland. I liked the collard greens and the cornbread with pepper jelly. But the food overall wasn&#39;t up to par. It&#39;s amazing how much better Mighty Quinn&#39;s in the East Village is, given that it&#39;s much cheaper.	0
There is a few period of times, where a meal is worthy of a review, being cognizant of this place, it is amazing!	1
The worst customer service I had in my life!!! Apparently, you can sit down at that place only if you fully paid for your order! So be careful! They charge not for food but for tables there!	0
I just moved to Coconut Grove and didn&#39;t know the area at all. My friends and I were checking out our new neighborhood and happened upon this cute little sushi place with outdoor seating. This is where the complements end.<br><br>We were so hungry so we ordered the edamame, it was cold and unsalted. The sushi was not fresh and was slathered in what I&#39;m guessing was kimchee sauce. I&#39;ve honestly never left a sushi place with most of the sushi left uneaten on the table.	0
A deliciously eclectic menu and excellent attentive service. The deviled eggs were an unexpected treat and the pizzas were to perfection.	1
Loved, Loved, Loved our birthday dinner experience at Border Grill inside the Forum Shops!! I can't say enough great things about this restaurant! The food was outstanding! The service was outstanding! The desserts were outstanding!! Definitely will make this a place to frequent!	1
Excellent combination of food, service, and ambiance. The restaurant's location is a bit questionable (it is in the industrial part of Downtown, surrounded by ghetto factories and dark streets), but the restaurant's decor has an ubran, east-coast feel, with high ceilings, brick walls and small french signs and paintings lined up on the walls.The chef cooks amazing dishes according to the fresh ingredients purchased daily from the Farmer's Market. This was my second visit to the restaurant and the Sea Bass was cooked to perfection with different sauces/ingredients both times.You MUST try the peach tart (appetizer, not a desert) if you get a chance. This item is also seasonal and will only be around for a short time!!Overall, this is a great restaurant with friendly staff. I highly recommend it if you're ever in the Downtown area.	1
Yuk, watery yellow curry, the worst unflavored watered down curry sauce ever. For 8.00 there was 2- yes 2 pieces about 1 inch long of chicken in the yellow chicken curry.The pad thai was not good at all, over cooked, the shrimp were fan-tailed tough and over-cooked.Yuk, take out sucks from this place - what a waste of cash-ola	0
Love the food here! My favorite has to be their meat jun. My husband introduced to to meat jun a few years ago at this place and I recently had it again..still delicious! The only difference now is that they also include a miso soup. I was kinda upset that I didn&#39;t get to choose my 4 sides cuz I wanted both of the different kimchi. The last time I came here the nice lady let me pick. &amp; she remembered me &amp; my family :) <br><br>The meat jun was very yummy and came with this delicious sauce. I also had one of the ox bone soup but was a little disappointed since she told me that they had run out of the specific meat but she replace it with kalbi, however, it didn&#39;t have any flavor. Like really, NONE! I felt like I was just drinking water and some veggies. Hopefully next time I order that, they will have the right meat in stock!<br><br>Other than that, the lady who works there is extremely nice. I always find myself coming here instead of the other food places.	1
went here for my birthday and was bummed to see they took the swordfish off the menu, twas ON POINT! the service isn&#39;t too bad here and the live jazz on the rooftop was all i could ask for!! my fav drinks: writers block &amp; french maid. the pork appetizer was the bomb as well as the mussels. <br><br>its a beautiful beautiful view of the city as sunset hits, a highly recommended spot	1
The She Crab soup is a freshly made and very favorable. I also really enjoyed the Kale Ambrosia salad is a fresh and tasty arugula greens with citrus segments and was finished off with candied pecans and coconut. Fresh and delicious! <br>My entree was the Cajun Shrimp Po&#39; boy which was very fresh served with french fries and delicious too! <br>The service was great and the restaurant has a warm, friendly and cozy atmosphere too! I recommend Luella&#39;s Southern Kitchen you won&#39;t be disappointed!	1
Wow!!! Such horrible service! First of all, the rule where you can only order two meats at a time sucks--it just creates more work for the servers because they have to keep coming back looking annoyed. Second, they never refilled the banchan or came to help us cook &amp; cut up the meat. And last, when the server changed the grill, she also added hot water into the basin, over-poured and spilled hot water on my man&#39;s leg. When he said, &#34;Ow, water spilled on me&#34;, she just smirked. What.A. -_-<br><br>As for the food, it&#39;s decent for all-you-can-eat, only $17.99 for the cheaper version. You can get a wide variety of meats and side dishes, including pork jowl, beef belly, large &amp; small intestines (which I recommend because it&#39;s marinated and you get a special dipping sauce), pork rinds, and then the basic cuts such as beef tongue, brisket and short rib.<br><br>My favorites were the little side dishes, which are portioned smaller so you don&#39;t over eat. There are two types of rice, one that is kimchi fried rice (which even has little bits of meat) and kimchi rice lunch box (which isn&#39;t all fried together, it&#39;s shaken up in the tin box so it&#39;s not as evenly mixed together). The kimchi cold noodle is good too, cold kimchi broth with thin white noodles. And there are 3 different stews to choose from that all come out in the clay pot.	0
Overall the food was good and the prices were fair. My only complaint was that our food took a really long time to come out and we saw 2 other tables that arrived after us receive their food before us. We were a large party of 9, however so was one of the other tables who was seated after us.	1
We stayed at the Gold Coast several times and saw this restaurant but never stopped in until recently. The food is standard steakhouse offerings but the wine list is very good.  We had good service, good food in a quiet and calm atmosphere.  Very nice - we will return.	1
We were not impressed with the service or food quality and it was too loud for us to have a conversation. I won't go back. There are other Mexican places I like better.	0
BEST sulung tang in town. 4 stars for the food...and 1 star for the service. WORST service ever!whenever i go there to eat with my husband, i always see servers and the owner yelling at each other.... pretty stressful...	1
Stopped by here yesterday mid-afternoon for a Sunday cocktail. We were seated on the patio, which was surprisingly not busy (maybe 4 or 5 other tables occupied). We waited over 10 minutes and not once did a server acknowledge us. We decided to leave since it seemed that they didn't need our business.	0
I just paid another 2 visits to Butchers and Barbers over my birthday weekend. It truly is one of my favorite spots to pop into for a drink when I'm down in Hollywood, because it is super chill and the drinks are delicious. I'm looking forward to coming back and trying their food next time I'm in town!	1
Like a Dan Tana's but new. Despite reservations, you still wait a long while to be seated. The bartendar was at least fast, and the martinis were spot on so thanks. That always makes the wait bearable. It's a bit stuffy and pretentious for the east side but that Hollywood attitude is trying to spread to us and infect everywhere (aka Barbarella Bar, Reservoir). Ordered the white bean ravioli and it was meh. The more a dish costs, the less you get so be prepared with that mathematical rule. Also ordered the kale salad and it was great. Seasoned so well, tossed with dressing so perfectly and the baby carrots were mushy but a nice addition regardless.	1
After my initial impression of Umami, i really felt like i needed to give it another shot after the hype has died down. i'm so glad i did.so it was just another sunday and i was deciding on what i wanted to eat where i can also get a beer with a friend. so we opted for this location since it was so close amoeba (they barely pay you a pittance for a collection of good used cds!). anyway. we sat at a table and i was totally digging the decor of this place compared to the la cienega location.our server looked kinda like woody harrelson. we ordered a red rye (bourbon cocktail) and a hoegaarden. the drinks took way longer than they should have. but i thought mine was interesting, even though it wasn't spicy like i thought it would. whatevs, i'm here for the burger.i ordered the diablo bleu burger (which was a special that day) and my friend ordered the ... something hatch, but it had the green chilies on it. the server warned me that it's pretty spicy. but i really wanted that. the food came out in a timely manner. i cut my burger in half. i took a bite. frick it was delicious and satisfying juicy just like how i like my medium rare burgers! then i had a bite of my friend's burger, really messy, but sooo good!then i realized... this burger is not spicy at all! i looked at it, there was nothing spicy about it, in fact, it looked like the regular umami burger! hrm... i've never sent food back before and i was feeling shy that day and didn't wanna return it. my friend insisted that i did because "i was too nice" and i really definitely ordered the other burger because i specifically asked him to repeat what was on the diablo bleu and then i said "i'll take that!" so i raised my hand timidly and asked (i think it was the manager that shift) what burger it was that i was eating. so it was the umami. when i informed him that i ordered something else, he was quick to offer a new one. i felt really weird doing this, but i really wanted to try the other burger. but the umami burger was really good this time around. it was juicier and not as salty as the last time i had it at the other location.omg i'm sooooo glad i told them about my original order and they gave me the diablo bleu. i was in the mood for something spicy but i can't really take that much spiciness. this was the best spicy burger i've ever had. the blue cheese wasn't overpowering, but the spicy sauce with the combination of the peppers really created this warm, steadfast heat that was very filling, but not overpowering. everything was just really balanced and it made for a really interesting flavor. it's not something i'd order all the time since it's a very strongly flavored burger. but frick, it was delicious.notes: you can tell that our waiter really didn't like his job. the manager was super nice and cool. i really liked my burger this time. awesome.	1
Pay for chips, pay for salsa, pay for rice and beans, pay for extra corn tortillas. But hey, that's what you get for trying to get Mexican food outside of the Mission. I suggest going to the Mission.	0
We had a lovely Saturday morning brunch here. I'd recommend coming on the early side, we got there at about 10 am and were seated right away, when we left there were probably about 20 people waiting. We sat outside next to a lovely window garden. Service was quick and friendly. I had a scramble and my boyfriend had the salmon omelet. I like that you can have all of their omelet options as a scramble if you'd like. At the end of our meal our server came over to ask if we needed anything or a drink refill. I said just the check. He then offered me a refill coffee to go! I was stunned. That never happens. It was especially nice since we had already said we'd take the check.	1
I enjoyed Saturday lunch there.  I was hoping for brunch, but I didn't realize their brunch is only served on Sunday.  Still, I enjoyed it and recommend it.	0
Brought out of town guests because always liked this restaturant. Food delicious, service horrible. I have been here many tilmes and always enjoyed Bandera. First, hostess ve ry curt. Second, server brought entree before salad finisished. Because still eating first course, the servers acted put upon when told we hadn&#39;t finished. Server took wine glass before finished. WILL NEVER go back.	0
My wife and I love this restaurant.  We don't like raw fish.  The server suggested we get the fish in the sushi cooked to our liking.	1
I&#39;m a huge boiling crab fan but this place really sucks. <br><br>ALL shrimps &amp; crawfish where old, the whole sha-bang sauce was awful. I only had one shrimp then I changed the older &amp; got fresh shrimps but the sauce was still discussing couldn&#39;t eat it. <br><br>The waiter brought the manager to us &amp; he said &#34;the sauce taste different than California&#34; &amp; they took back the food. Only paid for the sweet potatoes fries that where very good.	0
Parking in ktown is confusing.<br><br>Only went here because my cousin&#39;s friend wanted neng myun (cold noodle). I cannot eat the chewy cold noodle so I got tonkatsu and it was mediocre. My cousin does not really like neng myun either so she got the soft tofu soup (soondooboo). I wish we went to BCD and ate soondooboo. Her friends said the neng myun was okay.<br><br>They offer self-serve hot broth. It&#39;s located near the desk/register. If the register is on your left then you walk a little more and the broth is in a metal water/tea dispenser looking thing. get a steel metal cup and put the broth in it :)	0
Came here twice and each time the pizza was made differently. I ordered the same thing both times. I got a cheese pizza. The first time it was cut in four pieces and the second time it was cut in six. I think it was better when it was cut in four because it made the pizza less droopy. I do understand its a thin crust but I thought that it could be a little more crunchy without burning it. The second pizza was the saad pizza. The first time I got it, it was perfect. The saad was tossed in the vinagerette before it was placed on top of the pizza. That was perfect because every bite had flavor on it. The second time the dressing was on the side and you had to pour it. It made it a very messy pizza with the dressing dripping down my arm. I love thin crust pizza and the cheese pizza was somewhat good but I think it&#39;s not worth the drive and the parking to come here.	0
How can a restaurant receive more than 1 star when they turn away business? I would have felt more generous to up the rating to 2 stars; had the Manager on Duty not completely failed at recovering (not once, but twice) from the TERRIBLE customer service exuded by both the hostess stand and reservations system. <br><br>Setting the scene: Monday afternoon at 4:30pm...two walk-in guests looking for a late lunch/early dinner after a rough day of meetings in the Loop. I called around 4pm to ensure the kitchen would be open and after waiting on hold for 2+ minutes, was disconnected and just assumed the Internet was accurate and continued on my journey to West Randolph. <br>Walking in; we were met by fake plastered smiley &#34;holier than tho&#34; hostess staff of four - clearly too busy at this early hour to take telephone reservations; but quick enough to say that they weren&#39;t able to seat us in the dining room because we didn&#39;t have reservations and they were &#34;booked&#34;...booked?!? I asked, astonished, staring at their cold faces blocking my way into their EMPTY dining room (not one table was taken). I pleaded that I had tried to call a half hour earlier, but was disconnected while on hold. Too irritated to wait any longer for an apology that clearly was not in their nature to present, I excused myself from their blessed, important presence before I reacted out of shock; I tend to have a short fuse when I am hungry.<br><br>Frankly, I do not care how many positive reviews this place/chef receives; if you fail at serving your customers than what is the point of a great dining experience. Parading your front of house staff around like they are apart of a team worthy of comparison to Trotters is the most off-putting and scathing way I can imagine to present your food. I was so disappointed I even called back to make a reservation as they had &#34;suggested I had done in the first place&#34;, and try to be the bigger person when (after another 2 minute wait on hold) was cheerfully told by a hostess that walk-ins were welcome at this early hour and we shouldn&#39;t have a problem being seated. The nerve!	0
The chicken and waffles were yummy! I&#39;m not a chicken wing fan so next time, I&#39;ll see if they can substitute chicken strips!	1
In my preparation for our road trip I had done a lot of research on places to check out at Pike Place Market. Pike Place Chowder was at the top of my list to try! When we got there around noon the line up was at least half an hour long. We were a bit hesitant to wait because we were starving! We saw that there was seating so we decided to wait. We ordered the seared scallop chowder, new england chowder, the market chowder and 3 dungeness crab rolls for us. I LOOOOOVED the New England chowder. This chowder was amazing and exactly what a classic, good clam chowder should taste like! The seared scallop chowder was my 2nd favourite. You could just taste how rich and buttery the chowder was. The market was tasty too and was a tomato based one. The market changes to whatever the chef wants to make. I think this one had oysters in it. The crab roll was really good too. It was really full of crab and came with a side of cocktail sauce. The cocktail sauce made the sandwich! Another thing I liked were the little oyster crackers that were on the shelf. I liked how they added texture to the chowder and didn't get soggy. There is also additional bread to dip in your chowder where the utensils are stored. I am definitely going back to Pike Place Chowder and don't let the line up scare you!. It's totally worth the wait!!!!	1
Great happy hour cheap prices on beer with about 30+ selections to choose from. The burgers are awesome or buffalo burger or even yes veggie or chicken. Bowl or bread style you choose. Options options is what the counter is about.	1
Amazing. Simply amazing. I ordered the Ricotta Eggs on Toast with chili honey sauce, and it was fantastic. They also make their own corn beef hash, which is an accomplishment in itself. And second, it was the best corn beef hash my (self-titled) food critic friend has ever had. The service was great, and the server even poured us new waters when he handed us the check. He and this place get an A++ in my book.	1
This place is great for quick tapas and claras. We went Friday night before a movie ordered 2 appetizer plates some fries and 2 dessert montaditos and it was a perfect meal. We are big fans of tapas and the quality of the meats is good the staff is friendly and a you can buy a pitcher of clara! Which is awesome. Only reason it doesn&#39;t get 5 stars is because I wish the platters came with a some more cheese!<br><br>Check this place out for an inexpensive tapas experience!	1
The food wasn&#39;t as good as I expected it to be. The price of the lobster and crayfish combo was $10-15 more than what it should have been since they increased the price last minute. They should at least change it on the menu. For the combo, it should come with potato and sausage, but I could barely see any of it in the bag. The garlic butter sauce was really oily and filling. The catfish basket was pretty good. Basically, all the food came in bags.	0
I was blown away by all aspects of this place. Had we not been lucky and gotten a table right away without a reservation, I might be singing a different tune. We walked up on a Thurs evening and it was packed. The hostess' reaction didn't look promising when we told her we didn't have a reservation. It was as if the gods wanted me to experience Perch, though, because another host walked up and said he had a table for two open immediately if we didn't mind sitting on the patio in front of the band. Umm, not at all!The band was great: a deep-spoken pianist backed by cello and drums. (Sorry, I don't remember his name.) They did some great covers and provided great background music for the busy roof-top restaurant. And overall, the place has a great vibe, lots of energy and kitschy warm decor.All the food we had was delicious! Started with pork belly and baked Brie (two separate things). Both were so tasty and just melted in your mouth. For the main course we shared gnocchi and steak frites. Again, soooo tasty. The truffle fries with the steak were especially good. Gnocchi I've had before was really heavy, but this fortunately wasn't. Despite being full, we both couldn't stop eating. For all the wonderful aspects of Perch, I'd definitely like to come back. And I highly recommend it.	1
I am guessing the HLK concept did not work out too well as the space has been converted to their 3rd Bachi Burger location. <br><br>I have been a fan of Bachi ever since they have opened and have dined at both locations over a dozen times.In addition being a huge advocate of the brand and send tons of our visitors to both locations. <br>However I have recently been turned off and disappointed by inconsistency of the product and service at the Ft. Apache location and stopped endorsing it. <br>I have tried all of the burgers on the menu minus the Shogun (I am waiting for the right occasion to splurge) so there is a particular standard that we have come to expect from the food. <br><br>Needless to say I was more than happy and willing to try the new location. <br><br>My order: <br>Spicy Miso<br>Egg on the side<br>Add Bacon <br>Extra spicy mayo<br><br>The burger was perfect! This is how I remember it the first time I ate it! The burger was juicy and bleeding with ko chu jang! <br>Almost every other time I&#39;ve ordered the spicy miso burger it was more like a wimpy miso... This burger alone restored my confidence in the Bachi brand and made me love this location. <br><br>The fries on the other hand were not up to the standard that has been expected of a Bachi Burger. <br><br>The Salt, Pepper and Garlic fries were not mixed well as we had a huge lump of garlic/ginger<br><br>The truffle parm fries barely had a drizzle of the truffle sauce and there was very little cheese. <br><br>The only other bummer experienced on this visit was the fact that they now charge $1 for any extra sauce. We love the spicy mayo that comes with the fries and usually run out before we hit the bottom of the fry cone. I hate to not pick but when I&#39;m paying $20+ for a burger and fries I don&#39;t want to be nickel and dimed for more sauce. Food for thought Bachi management.. <br><br>So here is the breakdown for the new location:<br>Food 4 star<br>Burger was a 5 but the fries were a 3 <br><br>Service 4* <br>We felt rushed while we dined. They were trying to clear the fry cones when we were still picking and pulled plates without asking. Service was friendly and water was refilled promptly. <br><br>I love bachi but I can&#39;t just give this location a automatic 5* rating due the aforementioned items listed above however, rest assured fans, this location will be my default to from now on to get my fix as long as the spicy miso stays the same...	1
Reminds me of those little places in NYC when you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re ordering but it&#39;s delicious!<br><br>Nothing fancy, but it is SO GOOD.	1
So the Apple Pan is no way perfect. But if you walk in with the right expectations you will understand why Yelpers and Angelenos love this spot.The Apple Pan is definitely 'old school'. From standing around waiting for a counter spot to open up to the paper plates that food is served on- AP is a throwback to another era.The food is almost always on mark. I've had various burgers and the egg sandwich and they are terrific. If you are a light eater this might not be the place for you. On a similar tilt-- if you prefer 99 cent burgers don't stop at the 'Pan.This is a classic spot for getting a great tasting meal quickly and topping off everything with a great piece of pie. The Apple Pan knows exactly what it is-- and I appreciate that!	1
This place is definitely a unique experience! I can&#39;t say the food is anything extraordinary, but you&#39;re basically paying for presentation. <br><br>I ordered the Bird&#39;s Eye View which is a chicken dish, with brussels sprouts on the side. It was a pretty big portion, which I barely ate half of and it was pretty tastey. It came with a giant metal bird attached to a board that the dish was placed on. It was very interesting but a little hard to eat since everytime you lean forward to put food in your mouth you feel like you&#39;re going to get stabbed in the eye by the beak. My friends got the slider and loved it! <br><br>For dessert we got the churro&#39;s which came with chocolate fondue. The churro&#39;s were huge! We also got the Marie Antoinette head. The cotton candy was bubble gum flavored and it came with a piece of cake and berries. It was all TOO much food , but it was worth the experience. Not a place I would dine at unless it was a birthday or a special event :)... Oh and make sure to order one of their special cocktails, they come with liquid nitrogen!	1
My friend just moved to this part of Greenpoint and introduced me to Onyx saying &#34;Yay, there&#39;s a beer garden in my neighborhood!&#34; <br><br>The interior is a swanky bar and in the back they have a great patio with lots of tables. We got borscht with sauerkraut and mushroom pierogis ($4.95). Everything tasted really freshly made. We also got Polish beer ($5). It was pouring out but the bartender/waitress was really sweet and came outside to serve us under the umbrellas. I&#39;ll definitely be back!	1
We ate here for the first time after going to the American Craft Council show in the Convention Center because the hotel/restaurant was next door and it was below freezing with the windchill.Unfortunately, it was not a good experience. The hostess was very nice but wasn't able to answer any of our questions. We ordered the &quot;Tennessee Cheer&quot; cocktail and asked that it be served &quot;up&quot;. The waiter seemed doubtful about this and came back to make sure we knew the drink involved &quot;muddling&quot;. He then brought us watered down whiskey with club soda and no taste. When we complained he took the drinkc back but intimated that he had tried to warn us. As people who enjoy whisky cocktails, we don't think the problem was that it was served up or muddled, but that it wasn't make correctly in the first place.We then got our appetizers and our burgers at the same time. The burgers weren't great and that included their regular burger and the &quot;turkey portabello&quot; which is a turkcey burger with the mushroom and cheese inside. Weird and not good. We declined dessert and were happy to leave.	0
The one star is not because of the quality of the food, the food was great. We started out with ahi poke, it came out in decent time, huge chunks of ahi, seasoned well with sesame.. delicious! My boyfriend and I both ended up getting the breakfast with rice and eggs, his with Portuguese sausage and mine with spam. Again, both very good.. but then again, how can you really mess those up? haha. Ok, now to the one star.. Upon walking in, there was a lady at the register right next to the door, she didn&#39;t say anything. She didn&#39;t even budge to maybe attempt to acknowledge that we walked in. My boyfriend then asked her how SHE was doing, she answered and then nothing! He then asked if we just seat ourselves, she said &#39;sure&#39;.. no menus, nothing.. So I took it upon myself to grab two menus and we took a seat. (mind you, we were the only two in there besides the employees). Someone eventually came over and took our order.. &#34;are you two ready yet?&#34;.. uh, yeah..sure.. sorry for the inconvenience. Just when we thought we were in the home stretch, the lady at the register starts making this god awful clearing of a throat noise every 45-60 seconds. Over and over and over and over...(fast forward to us leaving..) and over again. It wasn&#39;t just a little ah hem, it was like she had something seriously stuck in there and I was completely surprised she didn&#39;t end up spitting a chunk of something each time. It was so bad that it got to the point where my boyfriend was going to ask her if she needed him to get her water or something for her throat. Overall, food was good, but the service..I will NOT be returning because it was just THAT bad. I&#39;m sorry to inconvenience you with my patronage, I won&#39;t be doing that anymore.	0
Good food selection and a hell of a lot cleaner than most Mongolian BBQ places. Friendly staff too.	0
The arm hair (I assume arm hair otherwise it would be much more nefarious) was not the sort of garnish I was expecting. At least that explains why it took them so long to prepare.	0
Wife and i went over for some Cuban sandwiches and where totally impressed! Flavors great, meats wonderful, and the bread was just what i would hope food snobs would want to see...artisinal greatness.	0
Warning!!! Do Not order Catering from here! Ordered lunch for an office meeting. They didn&#39;t send enough food. When I called about the issue they argued with me for a good 15 minutes till they agreed to send over additional food. By the time the food got here the meeting was over. Only positive experience was the delivery guy.	0
Great laid back feel to this bar. Food is FABULOUS. People are friendly and wanting to help. Beer is good :). Must try the various tacos and other food combos as they are inventive, flavorful, and quality.	1
Dined here this week after eating here a few times in the past and was severely disappointed. <br><br>Our server James was horrible. He was condescending and every time one of us asked about menu options he tried to downplay the portion size and quality to up-sell us to a steak that was off the menu. I ended up ordering a porterhouse, not knowing the price and found out that it was a $90 steak once the bill came. The steak was nowhere near worth $90. Was it good? Yes...but I&#39;ve had MUCH better in town for far less....and I feel like I was duped when ordering it. <br><br>When we sat down to order we all ordered various small plates to share to get the dinner started. We were in no rush and just wanted to enjoy the experience and food. We told this to James our server and he became irritated that we&#39;d be taking our time. Keep in mind our reso was for 8:30pm and we didn&#39;t get seated till 8:50pm...so it&#39;s not like they were going to turn the table again after us. <br><br>James tried rushing us into ordering entrees again once our appetizers hit the table and rolled his eyes at us when we told him we weren&#39;t ready to order. He started going on about how the kitchen needed time to cook the steaks because of their thickness and again we had to explain we weren&#39;t in a rush....and we didn&#39;t even say we were ordering steaks at this point. <br><br>When a guest isn&#39;t ready to order....they aren&#39;t ready to order. <br><br>We eventually got our food and while there were some hits and misses on the table, overall the food was good...but not worth the price. For $400 for a party of 4 I would have MUCH rather gone to Carnevino or another steakhouse on the strip.<br><br>James was tipped 10% because of the poor quality of service, the misrepresentation of their pricing and his condescending attitude. I knew I did the right thing by tipping him that amount when we came by to grab the signed bill while we were still leaving the table, saw he was tipped $40, scoffed and gave us dirty looks. <br><br>For the record, I&#39;m usually a 25-30% tipper when the service is good and when I know I&#39;m taking up a table a little longer than most guests in a server&#39;s section. There was no need for James to be sneaky with the pricing. If a steak is $90...then it&#39;s $90...but tell me that it&#39;s $90 upfront.	0
I can't even rate the food because I wasn't even given the opportunity to have any. My friend and I came here for lunch and sat down at the bar stool area. We sat there for at least 15-20 minutes and NO ONE asked us for our order. They didn't even acknowledge our presence. We didn't even get glasses of water. The staff either completely ignored us or just stared at us. Eventually we just got up and walked out when it became abundantly clear they weren't going to help us. They even asked the people sitting next to us if they needed anything and continued to ignore us! The 2 guys working here were the rudest staff I've ever seen at a restaurant.	0
We just tried Pi-Hi for the first time today and were beyond impressed not only with the service, but also the food. We came in for a pick up order around 3pm, and were very pleasantly surprised. <br>It is small, but very cute and clean on the inside. We were warmly greeted by the staff, and the owner came over and introduced himself, offering us samples of the fresh squeezed strawberry lemonade, as well as a sample of one of the smoothies (strawberry banana, I think), all of which were very fresh and delicious. The owner told us that they are expanding the menu, and I can&#39;t wait to see what the new additions are. <br>I got the Chicken Schwarma plate, and my boyfriend ordered the Beef Schwarma. Both were very good and fresh, and were nice hearty servings which included rice, pita,hummus, falafel, house marinated olives,and salad with romaine, cucumber, tomato, onion and dressing. The hummus had obviously been prepared fresh, and was perfect in both taste and consistency. We were also offered a few different choices for side sauces, and picked the tahini and hot sauce, both which were excellent. <br>The portions in both food and beverage were quite generous, and were definitely very reasonably priced. the service was fast, super friendly, and the food was WAY above average. It&#39;s nice to have a new affordable spot down the street with healthier options. We will definitely be back on a regular basis, and I can&#39;t wait to try the brick oven pizzas (which looked amazing), and the panini options. Definitely check this place out, you won&#39;t be disappointed.	1
Great service, per usual. Meat was a bit salty. When asking how you like your meat cooked, go a bit lower than what you normally would ask for - they usually give it to you more cooked than you expect - eg. medium was really a well-done, medium rare was more medium. I usually like a rare plus/medium rare but asked for rare bc what they were giving me was overdone to my taste.	1
I understand that many countries have created their own version of ceviche because it has become such a popular dish. But at a peruvian restaurant the food should be cooked correctly. The ceviche i got was pre made. The fish was chewy and cooked as if it had been left in the lemon over night the lime was bitter and there was a strong taste of celery that overpowered the whole dish. Im giving them 2 stars because the chaufa de mariscos and the jalea were good but I would not come again.	0
I dig Bluephies! They have a varying selection of tasty dishes and the most amazing desert! How can it get better than cookie dough egg-rolls and butterfinger won-tons snuggled up to ice cream and chocolate sauce?	0
Word is spreading fast about this eclectic Korean spot on Damen. I&#39;ve been twice now, and the second time there was a sizable line by 6:30 on a Friday night. We may have to start taking the deliciousness to go! The bibimbap is ginormous and chock full of 16 fresh, tasty veggies with your choice of rice, sauce (hot or soy) and meat (spicy pork belly or Korean beef). <br><br>The rolls are also amazing -- I love the mango tempura shrimp with avocado and micro greens. Even the California roll is memorable, thanks to the imitation crab salad filling instead of the usual stick. And the owner is super friendly and eager to teach first-timers how the food is meant to be eaten.<br><br>Great food, great service and zero pretension is hard to come by in this area -- needless to say, we will be back!	1
Had lunch here with a friend, amazing. I had the house crape with the kiwi, honey, and pistachio. She had the salmon crape. Both to die for. Great service and super cute cafe.	1
Good food, good dessert, friendly staff! I can&#39;t ask for much more I had the crab kipes and the coconut shrimp salad... solid spot for good inexpensive food	1
All pasta's homeade in an open kitchen awesome Ragu. expensive and a little exclusive to get into but it's worth it.	1
Awesome cafe near USC. This place has free wifi, lots of seating, and nice workers. I believe the owners/building is a catholic church. So let me take you down a memory lane...<br><br>You parallel park next to the cafe which is in front of a school with many kids running around during recess. You enter the first lawn with a bunch of chairs, tables for you to conversate with someone or do homework. You enter the actual house and you find indoor tables as well as outdoor table on the porch. Bathroom is upstairs and you will find this place to be extra clean.<br><br>In terms of drinks/food, I&#39;m sorry : ( I did not get a lot of things, but the coffee is quality coffee for the cheap price. This place originally was going to get a 5 star, but I just realized that I did not drink anything spectactular, the 4 stars is for the environment, free wifi, and cool decor. Minus 1 star for the coffee. Nonetheless, come here to catch up on some reading or studying.	1
I try to eat at as many of Jose Andres' restaurants as I can. The food here was fantastic! Some of the items are on other restaurant menus, like Oyamel. The service was OK. The server was kinda pretentious and not friendly, but we still had a great time. Try the guac, ceviches and salt air margaritas. So good!	1
We went back to Tango last night again to try it out as the first time there the paella weren't that great and we only had an okay overall experience with the food.	1
Loved this new restaurant we discovered. Over-all value was good. Service was a bit slow, but very friendly which definitely made up for it. Everything we ordered was very good. Our faves were the miso soup with clams, scallop and kiwi, chicken skin skewer, and a couple of their specialty skewers ( can&#39;t remember the names of those). We will definitely be back!	1
The beef Cali sandwich is amazing! For roast beef, it's not as heavy on the stomach to eat. I don't go for sandwiches loaded with flavor and meat but they have options to satisfy those cravings too!	1
I met my close friend for brunch here and I was very disappointed. We love to try new places, and this promised southern comfort food. <br>The biscuits were very dense and thick. Not light and fluffy. The shrimp and grits were over seasoned. I got the omelet and it was also over seasoned with a dry piece of bread. <br>The drinks were flat and the service only so-so.	0
Absolutely one of the best dining experiences of my life. We were lucky to get in because of cancellation. I know some people wait for months and in some cases a whole year. The location, the ambience and the random people you meet is amazing. It&#39;s just very different and unique. I love how you can see the staff prep all the dishes and you are allowed to just stroll around. It&#39;s a very inviting and relaxing atmosphere. I also love all the art on the walls. The food was so delicious and beautifully prepared. One word of advise, phase yourself when eating. You don&#39;t want to get full too quickly, you want to be able to enjoy all the dishes. I really hope I can go back. Both me and my boyfriend truly enjoyed it and it was so nice to stay and chat with the staff afterwards. BRAVO!!!!	1
expensive for very little food	0
First time trying this place out, was overall pleased with both the level of customer service and menu options they had listed. The staff were attentive and made sure customers were satisfied. Due to an overly busy lunch hour, they ran out of the confit pork belly. I ordered the fish taco, chipotle chicken and steak. All 3 of which were wonderfully seasoned and well portioned. They also offer a large variety of hot sauces, some too hot to even try. The best part was the Breakroom fries, greasy but so worth every bite! I would definitely go back, even for a quick bite before catching the next subway/bus/cab.	1
My friends and I came here around 9pm on a Saturday night. When we came, the line was not more than 15 minutes. We just came for a couple drinks, to just hang out. Their drinks are great. The view is perfection. My only complaint is that it's very hard to find seats for 4 people. We stood around for a while and just enjoyed the view and were eventually able to squeeze into 2 open seats. The best part is no cover!	1
I&#39;m rarely in this part of town, but should I find myself there around brunch time again, Fitzcarraldo is a must. Besides obvious Herzogian bonus points, the space is rather lovely (although the view is more or less industrial wasteland). Attentive server, the slow scrambled eggs and spicy potatoes were delicious. Red Snapper was perfectly spiced, and the taste of a friend&#39;s polenta with ricotta, leeks and a poached egg was divine. Curiously, our table of 5 were the only patrons. Business should be booming...I hope people realize they survived the 3rd Ward disaster.	1
Had a wonderful experience at Perch last night. <br><br>The door girl Carlina was the nicest door person I&#39;ve ever met in LA. <br><br>Had their Bordeaux, was stunning. Great view. Excellent music. You won&#39;t be disappointed.	1
Love the breakfast always fresh and plenty to eat!!!	1
The best breakfast in S.Florida, period. Service is always on point and the food is as good as it gets.	1
First off I am not really a Thai food fan in general. I thought I&#39;d let readers know that up front. However, I did have the pleasure of dining here the other night and loved it. The wait staff was exceptionally friend and the dishes were very tasty. Its not quite a hole in the wall type of place, but you do have to actively look for it. <br><br>I am still not a Thai food fan, but I would eat her again. If I were to become a Thai food fan, it would be due to this place for sure!	1
Horrible placs. Did the online orderinf and my food got an hour and 30 mins later than expected. Arrived cold.&#39; driver was rude as well and I called to check up on them and they hang up on me twice! Definirely tellig my friends to stay away from this place. Terrible	0
This place was awful. My friend and I ordered delivery from here last night. The food got here decently quick, but the driver had to call me FIVE TIMES to figure out how to get to my apartment.<br><br>I can understand this if it was a confusing building but its usually common sense that if its apartment *** and I put instructions to press #*** on the buzzer, you&#39;d think they&#39;d at least get that yeah? No. Two calls to figure out how to work the buzzer (its literally #***). I finally get them buzzed in!<br><br>Now...you&#39;d think if its apartment ***, and the elevator is right there, they&#39;d go to floor *, then find apartment *** right? (I mean everyone else I order from has always gotten it and I order a lot of delivery haha) No. Three more calls. <br><br>Eventually I finally got my change and my food and my friend and I sit down to eat. Anddddd the story gets worse. He had ordered orange chicken and within a couple minutes said he was getting a stomach ache and stopped eating it.<br><br>As he&#39;s saying this I&#39;m trying to enjoy my vegan curry but right as he pushes his food away, I pull a nice long hair out of mine. It was definitely not mine and I push my food away as well. <br><br>...this place was awesome for my starvation diet (I woke up losing a lb today from not eating all day, thanks Asava! :D haha) but definitely a waste of $30 and my friend wasn&#39;t to happy since he prefers to eat good food than lose a lb. Meh. Won&#39;t be ordering from here again.	0
What a nice little hidden getaway charming rooftop hotel!!! Just opened last October 2011 and it looks amazing.<br>Super tiny and hip!<br>Would consider staying in this boutique hotel	1
PROS- Very chic interior with many different sections - including an outdoor area - and seating arrangements to choose from. CONS- I ordered a coffee which ended up being $3. It came in one of those stupid bowl mugs and it was the worst cup of coffee I've ever had: sour, overheated, and old. I seriously couldn't finish it.- One employee - the guy with the pony tail and tattoos - was completely rude to me. I asked him for the Internet password and he suspiciously asked me if I had ordered anything. I told him I had ordered a coffee but he still felt compelled to check the table I was sitting at to see if I had bought anything.OVERALLSCREW THIS PLACE! I will never come back here and I certainly won't recommend it to anyone. Bad coffee is inexcusable especially if you're charging $3 for it. And, to top it all off, what kind of business are you running when you question your customers' integrity. Uggh!Seriously if you want good coffee in an unpretentious environment where there is good customer service, go up the street to Royal Grounds!	0
My boyfriend and I do a pretentious brunch once a month and this is where we had our first... and man did it set the bar high.This place is wonderful! You get so much food! Whatever you order, then a side of fruit and (of course) toast. And its a decent price for LA standard. Not to mention the staff is always friendly and the atmosphere is fun. I can't speak for the rest of the menu... but the omelets are incredible.Also, every time I've been I have seen a celebrity. Last time it was Dane Cook.	1
The best coffee after a hangover ! My brother lives right down the street from this place and I walk there whenever I visit him in Brooklyn. Seriously great coffee, generous portion size at about 2.50 for regular coffee...no hipster specialty brews for $5 because those suck anyways	1
We visited Tony&#39;s on August 4. This was a truly terrible experience. We were seated next to 4 ladies who had been repeatedly &#34;overserved&#34;. They were very drunk and obnoxious.Theyshould have been thrown out. Totally ruined our meal, wish I had the money back we wasted on this place.Plus, the food was mediocre at best.	0
I&#39;ve been impressed with Il Porto in the past, first experiencing their pizza when delivered to my office for an office lunch, then I ordered pizza and salad for dinner a few weeks later. Both times, the food was excellent, especially their prosciutto and arugula pizza. Last night, I decided to order something different - salmon alla griglia and clams with spaghetti and white clam sauce. The clams dish was quite good, although it would have been outstanding with angel hair pasta instead. But the real disappointment was the salmon. Yes, I understand that it&#39;s salmon on the grill, but this was ridiculous. The salmon was totally overcooked and it was so bad that a third of the salmon was burned and charred to the point of being inedible. They were kind enough to send a replacement, but this time, the salmon was undercooked and raw inside, so that I had to microwave it for a couple of minutes to ensure it was properly cooked. After a long day at work, I was looking for a nice delicious Italian meal with no hassles, but I was quite disappointed in Il Porto&#39;s execution. Lesson - when ordering from Il Porto, stick to the pizza.	0
I love the drinks, but not the crowd. It&#39;s unbelievable how crowded it gets around the bar. I wouldn&#39;t recommend this place for a large group of people. When you do go, the mac and cheese is divine, but extremely rich and better to share it with someone. <br><br>The drink i would recommend is the Ice Breaker. Amazing and refreshing. The drink is a mix of sweet white wine, vodka, and has frozen grapes settling on the bottom of the glass. Trust me, this drink is to die for.	1
Really, surprisingly, not a fan of the food here. I had the friend steak (don&#39;t know why, not my usual, just went out on a whim) and it really was the toughest piece of meat I&#39;ve had. The cocktails were good and service was spot on and friendly. But my friend&#39;s fish meal was just OK as well... was disappointed by the lack of tasty southern flavors...	0
I don&#39;t know about this &#34;Carolina-style&#34; chicken jazz, but I do know my southern Illinois chicken, and I&#39;m on a hunt to find something in Chicago that tastes like my childhood. <br><br>You have to understand, I grew up going to a restaraunt named &#34;Chicken&#39;s&#34;, where their specialty was, you guessed it, amazing fried chicken. I have yet to find anything that compares to that, but The Roost was pretty good in its own way.<br><br>I had what I think was the least spicy option (quarter white meat bone-in) with mac&amp;cheese and a biscuit, and a sweet tea because duh. <br><br>The crust was super crispy, and to my heat-hating palate, it still had a slight spice to it. It was definitely greasy, but the chicken itself was super moist. Mac&amp;cheese was decent, nothing amazing. The biscuit was delicious, super buttery &amp; I slathered that bad boy with the honey that was on the table &amp; saved that for dessert.<br><br>Yes, you&#39;ll leave there smelling like a walking bucket of KFC, so maybe don&#39;t go here before a night out. Yes, you might slip on your way to the bathroom b/c the hallway floor is super slippery (is that grease or just bad cleaning products? I have no idea). Yes, your stomach might be mad at you later because of ingesting all that grease. And yes, it&#39;s worth it.	1
I always take my friends here after showing them around Hollywood. It makes me seem extremely cultured because I know of this small, cozy diner that's open 24 hours. You MUST try the thai cobb salad. When I first read that this salad had bacon bits and egg, I was close to vomiting because I had never conceived eating such a concoction. But my brother highly recommended it so I gave it a try, and it was fantastic. The sauce they use was especially tasty.As for dessert, they make a mean capuccino and peach cobbler with vanilla ice cream on top. They're burgers and sandwiches tend to be a bit dry though.Fred 62 is a great place. The atmosphere is amazing, and I think this homey diner is a testament of what Hollywood is really about.	1
a hidden gem in DTLA!!!! sushi is pretty well as well as the drinks, i highly don't recommend the tacos!!!!!	1
Surprising food selection including some healthy options of fruits, salads sandwiches, breakfast burritos. Even found some kale, and some real whole wheat bread! Not your typical courthouse cafeteria. Add to that an amazing view of LA. Almost makes coming to court an enjoyable experience. Almost.	1
Nothing special and the worst they do not have parking	0
This is a limited review because 1) we only go for lunch and 2) I always order the same thing Chili Verde over grits. I always want to try something else on their menu and my co-workers always love their dishes... but when you find something so completely delicious and satisfying... well let's just say that a soft moan escapes me every time I take that first bite.	1
I want to focus a short review on the service: Our server was great, attentive, friendly, knowledgeable and helpful with ordering and explaining the various items. Also got an inedibly salty (and too-small-for-the-price) fried chicken comped for us with a replacement.<br><br>However, the busers are WAY too aggressive. One review below mentions asking if a plate could be &#39;taken out of [her] way&#39; while she still had a forkful of it mid-air -- and we had the same experience. An unfinished bowl of the smoked fries was whisked away along with other empty plates, for example; and the busers came more and more frequently and insistently the more we sat there -- so we felt guilty lingering and trying to catch up with our good friend, which is not the kind of restaurant I want to eat at. I totally understand they have to turn tables, but as far as I&#39;m concerned, just be upfront and say you have people waiting, instead of playing good cop (server) bad cop (bussers) passive-aggressively.<br><br>And this is hardly the only restaurant that does this (Yusho, Au Cheval -- I&#39;m looking at you). It just totally ruins the social experience of dining with someone when you&#39;re reminded so often that you&#39;re basically an unwanted squatter.<br><br>Is there any way to stop this business practice? (I know, complaining on Yelp won&#39;t do it. But it does give me a way to vent!)	0
Ai-ya-ya!	1
Service is hit or miss - sometimes they&#39;re on point, other times I have to ask for vital parts of my meal repeatedly before they show up on the table. I&#39;m sure their onion rings would be delicious, if I could get them while they&#39;re still hot, as opposed to lukewarm and soggy. Blackened dolphin is always a good way to go, btw. In a wrap or in a sandwich, it&#39;s consistently yummy!	1
Food is really really good; but WAY too expensive. $9 for four small Dolmades?	0
I&#39;m from Nola and this was weak. We ordered crawfish puppies and they were pasty inside. My husband ordered soft shell crab poboy and the batter in the crabs was crazy thick and flavorless, plus they didn&#39;t clean out the crabs, yuck. I ordered grilled oysters and they did not properly shuck them from the shell. we also tried the lump blue crab cake and there was no lump about it. SAD experience for me. plusthe server ignored my feedback. If you are familiar with true southern food, cook it yourself.	0
if you like old bottles and dirty tap lines, this is probably the place for you. yes, the beers are cheap, but they all taste like shit. you&#39;d think a place this big would move a lot of product and have some fresh beer. not the case. if you&#39;re a blue moon kind of guy and want to expand your horizons, i guess this is the place for you. there are several other places in miami worth supporting that actually give a shit about what they&#39;re pouring you.	0
Best sandwich in town bar none.	1
Decided on Cliff&#39;s Edge for a friend&#39;s belated birthday brunch. Made an 11:15am reservation for Sunday and the two of us were seated instantly in the upper section of the beautiful patio. Everything they say about the ambiance is true. It is cozy and intimate, but with enough open space that you feel like you are having your own private conversation and aren&#39;t party to anyone else&#39;s. The heat lamps are pumping too so don&#39;t worry about being cold.<br><br>We ordered the Brussels sprouts with a fried egg, the pork belly hash (which also comes with a fried egg and a couple more Brussels sprouts), and the warm biscuits with apple butter. Since we asked for everything to come out together and it came out quickly, there was really no room for our server to be slow except towards the end of our time there. But at that point we were digesting and enjoying a second round of blood orange mimosas so it was nice not to be rushed out.<br><br>Sunday brunch seems like the way to go if only for free parking on Sunset. We parked up the street closer to Intelligentsia and walked it. Otherwise, valet was $5.<br><br>Definitely not the cheapest, but the food was tasty and the drinks were strong. Perfect for a fancier date or a meal with friends. Would eventually like to return for dinner and would definitely make a repeat trip for brunch.	1
Yum, Yum, Yummie! &nbsp;And SO reasonably priced!	0
Come here if you want your hot subs served to you cold, or a vegetarian sandwich with nothing but chicken &amp; cheese in it!!! <br><br>I called at 11:15 to place an order for pick up at 11:45. I ordered an Italian, Chicken cheese steak, vegetarian cheese, &amp; a capastrami. <br><br>Get there at 11:45, &amp; the skinny, young guy with glasses at the cashier tells me it&#39;s on the grill, so I paid beforehand and was waiting. <br><br>15 minutes later, my food still wasn&#39;t out, so I asked that guy if my food was ready to which he was just like &#34;oh yea... It&#39;s right here&#34;... Giving me a bag of luke warm sandwiches... By the time I got to my friends house to eat them, they were barely warm. <br><br>So we&#39;re eating, &amp; my cousin ordered the vegetarian cheese... It said vegetarian cheese in the wrapper... But inside, there was only chicken &amp; cheese... <br><br><br>I don&#39;t think their job is so difficult that they fuck it up this bad,	0
We had Christmas dinner here with our son, visiting from San Francisco.  Everything from the setting to the food to the service was spectacular.  But, unfortunately, the weather outside was warm for December 25th and they seated us next to the roaring fireplace in the dining room.  When we asked to be reseated, we were told that every table was booked and they were sorry but they couldn't accommodate our request (understandable).  They did help us by moving the table away from the fireplace a bit, but we still steamed!  When the dining room manager came over to throw more logs on the fire, we tried to stop him but he replied that other diners in the room liked the fire (as he threw 4 more logs on)!  Our prix fixe dinner was over $450 with wine and gratuity -- quite a bit to be treated rudely.	0
This place is awesome! amazing food and cocktails. very unique. great prices and great customer service!	1
I used to like this place, until I walked in a few minutes ago and a giant, I mean at least 3 inches long, cockroach made it's way across the wall below the cookie display. Luckily an attractive male customer swooped in for the rescue and smashed the cockroach with a definitive crunch. The sound of the breaking exo skeleton alone was enough to ruin my appetite. Still have goosebumps, because if there is one, there are more!	0
The food was alright, I would not have complaints about it, were it not for the fact that there was a hair in my food. That would not even have been a big issue, if the staff had handled it properly. When I politely let them know there was hair in my food, I kept waiting for an apologetic reaction, which never came. Not only that, but they seemed to either not believe me, or not care. I really wanted to make sure the hair was not actually mine, but as it was IN the food, and not ON it, it could not have been mine. Nobody apologized, they brought me back a smaller portion of the same thing (this was done too quickly, and so it seemed they simply cut my original food, instead of making a new dish), and they didn&#39;t make sure we were happy by trying to make up for the bad (quite gross) experience. Had they actually cooked my dish again, and brought us something to make up for it or something, I would not have been disappointed, but there was nothing of the sort.	0
The best deli experience in L.A., bar none. And all for as much as you might pay at Denny's or some other bland, generic, soul-less spot. Canter's has absolutely authentic old-school deli character, coupled with fresh, perfectly prepared food. Service is loving and attentive. I've never been here before 11pm, and I believe it to be the finest place for satisfying, late-night food in all of Los Angeles.	1
Been waiting for our 4 pizzas for 2 hours, they&#39;re in the oven right now. C&#39;mon, you kidding me? We&#39;re freaking starving over here!!!	0
I can really appreciate some good Mediterranean food. Mediocre Mediterranean? Not so much... As far as it is from my house, I doubt I&#39;ll make the drive all the way out here any time soon.<br><br>KABOBS: Doesn&#39;t Mediterranean food revolve around grilled meats? The steak souvlaki was a little tough, quite flavorless, and dry. Given I did take my order to-go, but the 15 minute drive home exasperated an already existing issue. The gyro meat was pretty tasty! It was thinly sliced and quite flavorful unlike the beef chunks they threw on a stick.<br><br>SIDES: The combo plates we ordered were supposed to come with greek salad, rice, and pita. The pita was stone cold and they were out of rice--they replaced it with extra salad. We also got an order of the garlic fries. Basically, french fries packed with feta and some garlic powder. I&#39;ve eaten better at the greek festival. <br><br>The kabobs and the rest of the sides were somewhat lack-luster. But we really enjoyed the calamari. It was just as delicious as the stuff I get at Firefly. But the dipping sauce it came with was disgusting . It was some stale tasting butter concoction.<br><br>After this meal of good and bad, I&#39;m kind&#39;ve over Mediterranean food at this point. After finishing the whole meal, I couldn&#39;t substantiate that the $25 I spent plus gas was worth it.	0
Being outside is nice and cold beer is nice but the food is the worst I've had in San Francisco in my last dozen or so trips here. Definitely avoid this tourist trap if you want to eat dinner. An OK place for drinks in the bier garden, but you can still do better elsewhere.	0
My boyfriend and I had the pork and five spice chicken banh mi. While they were fine as sandwiches in general go, they were probably the most underwhelming Vietnamese sandwiches I've ever had. Admittedly, I may not be an expert, but, the main problem was that these sandwiches lacked the fresh flavors I associate with banh mi. It tasted very... American (I know this makes me sound like a snob, but I don't know how else to describe it) and the bread was not as good as I would have liked, either.	0
The Product- Over rated for a burger that just tasted okay, not worth the price. islands has better tasting burgers for a better price and it comes with endless fries... The Service- First i would like to say she was nice, but totally for got one of our orders and when she came back and said it was coming out and never came out.. "MADE MY BURGER TASTE EVEN BETTER"Places to eat asides from this place.. go to the counter, and the fathers office if not go to Mc Donalds..	0
I&#39;ve went there for solo dinner.<br>To start with, the staff and the service was great and with a smile.<br>The food was good as the service and the pork chop I had was delicious.<br>The place is small which adds to the charm of it. I recommend it for<br>Travelers with low-medium budget	1
Even a cool looking spot on The Embarcadero can turn a sunny afternoon into an unpleasant experience. Such was the case this past Sunday at Pier 23.Having found a parking spot right on the Embarcadero across from Pier 23, I thought was a good omen. My first clue that this may not be the case, was when the parking meter (now needing to be fed on Sunday) charged $2.50 per hour. Nonetheless, since it was such a nice afternoon, my girlfriend and I decided to pay tribute to the meter and cross the street to Pier 23.We walked in and found two seats at the bar (which was not crowded at the time). Although there were two bartenders, service was a bit slow. Finally getting one bartender's attention we ordered a Virgin Mary and a Diet Coke. We then asked for a menu and my girlfriend asked for a glass of water. Bartender 1 delivered the menu and the glass of water along with a comment, " You sure ask for a lot." I took the offhanded remark as simply a poor attempt at sarcastic humor.After perusing the menu, we decided to order. Keeping in mind that the bar is not crowded, that there were two bartenders and that there is less than three feet between me and the bartenders, this should have been a simple task. Not so.I attempted to get Bartender 1 who served us to take our food order. I said "Excuse me!" not once but three or four times --- nothing. I waved and pointed to the menu, indicating that we were ready to order ---- nothing. I stood higher up on the bar stool to gain attention --- Bartender2 saw me and indicated he'd be right over, but as soon as I sat back down he went to the opposite side of the bar. Bartender 1 although there, was mute and kept his back to me. Finally, I said to my girlfriend that I didn't enjoy having to beg for service so we decided to leave. I then asked for the check saying, "I'd like to settle up." NOTHING. So I said it again. Bartender 1 still with his back to me remained mute. Bartender 2 saw me and said, " I don't know what you had." Why he didn't bother to ask Bartender 1 who was less than two feet from him I don't know. I said, " A Virgin Mary and a Diet Coke." Bartender 2 said, " Oh, twenty bucks!" Incredulously I replied, "What? Are you kidding?"At this point I was angry and I showed it. Bartender 2 then said, "Ok. Forget it. It's on the house."We then walked out, NEVER TO RETURN!!!	0
Okay... a Chicken Burger? Really? YES...REALLY!!!! It&#39;s sooooooooo good! <br><br>I wanted a burger after a hellish day of doing essay after essay and met up w/ a friend who suggested this place. When we got there I was like...ahhh they don&#39;t have burgers, why are we here...LOL!<br><br>So instead of going crazy... I adapted. Especially when I saw Chicken burger on the menu. I decided to try it since I wanted a burger, and it was burger of a different kind. <br>I was soooooooo happy that I ended up there, b/c that burger changed my life!!!!!! It was so flavorful and juicy... it satisfied that burger craving more than an actual beef burger.<br><br>The prices are affordable and you will get full with spending just $12. <br><br>Sadly, I&#39;ll probably be ordering from here since they deliver.... thanks for the extra 5lbs I&#39;ll be working off b/c you do...LOL!	1
We went here for dinner at around 7 but waited for over an hour to be seated. But the food was worth the waiting. We orded combo C for 6 people, and added two side dishes . We were worried that it was not enough and wanted to add some seafood too, but it turned out it was not necessary. Everybody was full and satisfied. The combo contained a variety of seafood and was very delicious.But beware. Your clothes will smell badly after you go home. It is a small place and the smoke from BBQ fills it. And be careful for the flame too. Parking: valet parking in a small plazaNoice level: noisyThey give some discount when you pay by cash.	1
WORST experience EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br><br>So we only have ONE birthday a year and want it to be special... So I chose this place for my birthday dinner/party since one of my friends had her birthday brunch there and loved the view. Maybe brunch and dinner service is different but my experience was horrible.<br><br>As soon as me and my couple friends sat down our waitress was snotty and had an attitude. Not sure why, because we were very friendly and excited to be there. The more of my friends came and joined the more the staff became unfriendly, maybe because most of my friends are african american??????? Not sure because I am white...<br><br>Anyhow, so after we were all complete, about 15 people ordering food and drinks (maybe this place doesn&#39;t care about revenue) one of my friends asked one of the wait staff about his order that he put in at least 15-20 min ago.. the waiters reply was: &#34;uhm, no sir, it was not 20min ago&#34;.... So naturally my friend was shocked and quiet friendly unsatisfied that the waiter even had the nerve to reply back not only w a rude attitude but even to argue over the time.... what happened to the &#34;guest is always right&#34;... even if it wasn&#39;t 20 min, the waiter should have just replied: &#34;I am sorry sir, let me go check on your order right away&#34;... and from then on it just escalated... the waiter literally started an argument with my friend and of course my friend argued back... then the waiter came back with a security guard and basically threw my friend out this place!!!!!!!!!! R you kidding me????? Its my birthday and these people just ruined everyones time because after this entire scenario nobody wanted to stay.<br><br>15 people w food and drinks had their night ruined because one staff member didn&#39;t understand that part of his job is to please his customers... not to mention the other waitress with her horrible attitude towards all of us.<br><br>Now let me talk about the food... OMG, have they ever heard about salt and pepper??? Do NOT order the potato soup, you might as well order baby food. GROSS, no seasoning and just awful. Same with the Club sandwich... no seasoning on the chicken what soever. <br><br>Not sure if the brunch is better but the dinner was not good. And we didn&#39;t even complain about it but tried to make the best out of this situation!!!!!!!!!! NEVER AGAIN. <br><br>The only good thing is the view but I can just go to the Downtown Standard or the Sky bar and get better food, service and a better view!!!!	0
I had to scramble to find a place for dinner the night before I-ball (because god knows why, we left the planning to the boys), and was very impressed by the quality of the restaurant. Great place, very helpful staff, and the food was delicious.	0
Great spot. Dropped by the beast by myself for a few drinks after a long day of sightseeing. Very relaxed atmosphere and nice decor. John the owner and the barman (I think it was Jake) were very friendly and had a great night chatting to them and some of the other patrons at the bar. I went for the meat platter as well, tasted great and filled me up a surprising amount for only $6. <br><br>Keep up the good work guys :)	1
OVERALL RATING:<br>Service: 1<br>Decor: 2<br>Food: 1<br>Dog-friendly: NA<br>--------------------------------------------------<br>Plus (+):<br>It&#39;s in the Mandalay Bay, so you&#39;re very close to something better<br><br>Minus (-):<br>Burgers and price<br>--------------------------------------------------<br>Unfortunately, this is the absolute worst burger I&#39;ve ever had. I wanted to like this place since Hubert Keller designed the menu. We tried the $16 Kobe burger which should have been moist and delicious, but instead it was a over-cooked, scrawny little hockey puck on a so-so bun. The fries were just OK. I&#39;ve had better...everywhere else.<br><br>My advice: <br>Save the money and go to Keller&#39;s absolutely fabulous Fleur de Lys. Go to the Las Vegas location, not the flagship San Francisco one. I tried both and they don&#39;t even come close to each other...so wierd.	0
The food was great and service awesome!	1
I really liked this place because they have awesome wings, but today really put a bad taste in my mouth. I placed an order for delivery at 8:40 and it's 10:20 and I have yet to still receive it. This place is 1.5 miles away and it takes and 1hour and 40 mins to cook when the drive is only 10 mins max?? No phone call or anything so I call and the they say they're on the way and they tried calling?? Lies. Now that we want to cancel it we ask to be compensated for something and they can't do anything. Crazy pepper you have good food, but because of your customer service or lack there of I will not be ordering from you ever again. Now I wish I could take away that tip I gave when making the order.	0
food was great but service was awful although the waiter was really hot, he was really stupid. went here with 4 other friends and we split the bill at the end. i gave him my credit card and he said it wasnt working. so he swiped another card. a week later i look at my statement and saw that he charged the card that didnt work so i called to have it removed which the girl on the other end did promptly so that was fine. but THEN i get my statement from the card that i left the charge on and he had charged me $52 instead of $32 which infuriated me because honestly how stupid can you be? i didnt call the restaurant and instead let my credit card company deal with it. RIDICULOUS! although the girl was super apologetic and offered me free wine the next time i went but i will legit never go back.	0
Best ever!!!	1
Their brunch is amazing if you can stand the long wait on the weekends and almost no parking.I enjoyed their omelettes and potatoes, and I want to go back again. Best brunch place in the area for far for me.	1
I'm in love with Lola!	1
These people don't know it yet, but I'm movin' in. My U-Haul is scheduled to arrive next Tuesday. I loved this place. Me and a friend went last Saturday night. Now, Saturday's show is burlesque and cabaret and the performers did a wonderful job. Stand-outs include the hostess, the Swedish Housewife, and Ultra, the trannie lip-syncing hot boy. Owww! Lemme hear you say Owwwww! Anyway, the food there was decent, but not so amazing that you'd want to go just for the food. The wait staff was INCREDIBLE. My water was constantly being filled, to the point where I was pretty sure that the waiter had a crush on me. At one point he even took my glass away to bring me a fresh one. Wha? So in short, I say GO. The decor is romantic swankiness and their lighting had that perfect blush that makes everyone look dewey eyed and 18 again. Bring a date and make out in the corner. I had declared (before arriving) that I was going to find someone to make out with, but alas, no luck. Mostly couples were in attendance. The only make-outable guy left early for lack of available seating (although he did have the balls to get my number first).	1
overated, overhyped, overpriced, over crowded tourist trap. Cask ale is a rare find, but at 9.00 bucks a pop it adds up quick. I&#39;ve been there for lunch, dinner and brunch and i just don&#39;t understand why people wait in line for this. Seems like the Studio 54 of gastropubs. People just get in line because the line is there and for no other reason.	0
Great chocolate chip cookie!! Huge, crunchy with lots of brown sugar. White and dark chucks, good quality chocolate. Has a very distinct crumb to it, very crisp but yet soft and moist.	1
We were visiting Brown University for family weekend and needed a spot for a large party--friends and parents wanting to dine together!  2 Paul's accommodated our last-minute request very cordially.  It was very easy to get to the restaurant--a quick trip outside of the center of the campus.  The food was fresh and delicious with the prime rib in particular a favorite of the evening.  Our server split our checks without us even having to make the request which was extremely helpful.  We are sure to return on another trip to Providence.	1
A good restaurant for great steak; on the night we were there, it was hugely busy, we were seated 45 minutes after our reservation, after being 'greeted' by one of the most rude male receptionists I have ever seen.  Wonder if he's heard about customer service??  Wow.  It was a very busy night, granted, but staff tried hard (except for the receptionist) to make up for it.  The food was your usual steak fare, very good, not terribly inventive.  I would go again, but when I could hear my dining companions without shouting, and when that guy at the front desk is gone!	1
This place errs a bit on the pricey side but otherwise it quite good! The wait can be brutal depending on the time of day you go but the food is and coffee is amazing. I highly recommend the coffee, it tastes so smooth and rich and doesn't leave you with the jitters at all and I am very sensitive to caffeine!	1
I thought the food would be fresh made. The specialty cornbread arrived still near frozen in the center. The rest of the food was worse than Chili's in quality. Our waitress was almost non-existent and no jest, I had to plead for my check so I could leave. The food network chef would be ashamed, I hope, if he knew what was being served using his name.	0
Heard about this place from friends so we went to try it out. <br><br>No wait for a table, $14 for unlimited coffee, a Bloody Mary or mimosa and a meal. Food was excellent.. Would go back just to eat the short ribs! <br><br>Places like Eastwick make me wonder why I wait 2.5 hours for a table at other brunch places, and pay 3x the cost for a meal which isn&#39;t as good. Will definitely return!	1
The Queso Fundido was an amazing appetizer, the cheese was just the right level of gooey-melty perfection. Yucatan pork and fish tacos were both also delicious. I will be sure to recommend this to anyone who asks about where to eat in Vegas!	1
It&#39;s hard to put into words how disappointing this dining experience was. After reading the reviews, I was ready for an awesome feast. Reservations for 10 friends, check. <br><br>And...<br><br>Seating for...8...barely, and had to huddle around mini side tables. Little attentiveness. Many of us made the apparent mistake of ordering an app AND an entree...I guess timing plays no role in the kitchen...as we were served everything at once (and refused requests to stagger the courses). Then waiter apparently only offered dessert options to 2 people out of our entire group.<br><br>It&#39;s been a couple days, and I still can&#39;t express how awful and disappointing Bea was.	0
Got my first sandwich to day from this cute little deli in the Tropicana Market. Man was I satisfied with my bbq pork sandwich!!! It was toasted on a fresh hoagie roll and the coleslaw was super tangy and fresh tasting. I&#39;m not much of a sandwich person but I loved the meat to bread ratio. Very generous portion. Will definitely be back. I wished I took a picture of it before I completely devoured it. Come support this place.... I would totally come here over subway. Quality ingredients and fantastic tasting food. yummo!<br>Plus prices are really good. This place is a total hidden gem.. actually the whole little market that has a fresh juice place in there too.	1
You know, I'm not a big fan of this joint. It hangs too much on the Tom Douglas name but, in the end, it's mediocre crust with sparse toppings. There's no value in eating here; and given it's price point, they should call it Serious Dough.	0
Amazing chef and fabulous salad bar just wasn&#39;t a fan of the jicama chili cheese fries...would try something else tho!	1
Went here on Thursday 7/3 for dinner. 2 hour wait for a table for 4?! Seriously? The hostess was super snotty, i asked if i can leave my cell phone number so I can run to publix and pick something up for my daughter and she said she couldn&#39;t guarantee anything. I was like guarantee that you can&#39;t call me?? The place has no where to wait. I felt like the 2 hour wait was a ploy to push people to spend money at the bar. <br><br>Seems like a confused wannabe Swine/Yard house. I&#39;ve never waited 2 hours at any restaurant, and I didn&#39;t wait 2 hours here. Wish I could review the food, but the 14 year old snotty hostess never called. I&#39;m going to wait like 2 months before I give it another chance, and only because I can literally throw a rock from my house and hit it. Good Luck!!	0
Wandered in...didn't know it was a local chain. Agree with another reviewer; it's LOUD in there...but still worth it. We went with one special the Al Pastore Enchiladas and then a standby...Carne Asada. Both were excellent the Enchiladas were fantastic the steak was perhaps the best Asada I have ever had...tender juicy and flavorful. An instant favorite.	1
Sunday brunches are the best. Before I ramble about how delicious Toast is, note: PARKING sucks. Like I drove in circles for 15 minutes looking for parking, found a spot on Beverly and la jolla. A nice walk away I suppose. LINE. quite long. Good thing my friend got lucky with parking and she put our name on the list so I didn't have to wait too long after I finished finding parking. And then the wait for a table was about 15-20 minutes but it didn't feel that long cause gossiping and people watching helped time fly :) People watching - there's a reason they shot an episode of The Hills here with Miss Kristin Cav "eating" here. The crowd looks totally trendy LA West 3rd street ish. Love it. Probably spotted a future celebrity but didn't know it. As for the food, it's yummy! Salmon scramble with egg whites has enough salmon and not too pricey. The stack sandwich had turkey, Brie, avocado and red onions melted. Soo good. With a choice of onion rings or sweet potato fries or salad or fries (no extra charge for onion rings or sweet potato fries either!) Mmm. I also ordered their mango frappe, not so yummy. A bit too sweet. It's not 5 stars cause of the waiting time I suppose, but that's not the restaurant's fault. Hmm. However for some reason Toast seems more like a 4 star cafe :) Tip: This cafe is not a wear sweats roll out of bed all comfy for Sunday brunch kind of place. Come here looking fab trendy like everyone else and enjoy that "I'm living in LA vibe."	1
Food was good fish tasted fresh real nice ambiance, and service was on point. They have private booths which is really nice and intimate. Had the fried tofu, yellowtail jalepeno, and other dishes, Great place to take a date.<br><br>Would def. be back soon!	1
Awesome staff here great hot dogs nice decor. Didn&#39;t get to sit in the backyard but it looks very nice!! My only reason for not giving it 5 stars is because there was no liquor but the beer was very good as well. Great place bring some friends and hang out a little.	1
This is a pretty nice gastropub. The decor is surprising deductive and service is excellent. We sat upstairs for a Friday date night and had a nice view of the city streets and patio area. Our waitress was on par but didn&#39;t see her very often. The downside of sitting upstairs I suppose. We ordered the Brussels sprouts which did not disappoint, the Blistered Sweet Corn pizza which was my favorite dish and the Marinated Charred Hanger Steak. I&#39;m not a big fan of hangar steak to begin with but the meat was quite tender. My only complaint is that they precut the steak for you, which in my opinion makes your food cold faster than it needs to be. Otherwise the food here is excellent.	1
Love this place! My favorite is the tuna melt! Get the fries extra crispy and don&#39;t forget the best banana cream pie ever!!!	1
Robertas is a disaster. If you want to fight a bunch of over privileged bohemians for a chance to get a mediocre pizza then this is your place. The menu has both some highly obscure ingredients served by one kitchen and then puns by the pizza kitchen. You can&#39;t pretend to be a fancy five star restaurant and at the same time have a pizza called &#34;erryday I&#39;m Brusselin&#34;. Hilarious Robertas! Your restaurant is the joke. Oh, and expect to spend a lot to get small portions of cold food. Don&#39;t waste your money!	0
Park in the huge lot across the street for a $6 flat rate.This was my first time here, so I really didn't know what to expect. There is no guest list because Perch is a lounge, but you wouldn't know that if you saw the line. I waited about 30 minutes in the line before I got in the building. Once you get in they take you to the 13th floor where I guess you have to wait in this "waiting lounge." It was a little strange, but you can grab drinks and mingle for a little bit. They have someone randomly pull people to see if they wanna "go up."He, then, escorts you to the elevator, and then you are FINALLY in Perch on the 15th floor.Given all that, the view was amazing, and the atmosphere is lively. You are rooftop in the heart of Downtown Los Angeles. I could NOT stop looking at all the pretty lights. There is also another line that takes you a floor up. This floor has no tables and is all just standing area. So why people go up there is beyond me. The 15th floor has tables, couches, and plenty of standing space.The line outside and the waiting lounge sucks, but once you get INto Perch, it's absolutely amazing. I found my new spot!	1
5 stars for excellent food and service. The happy hour is pretty awesome my girlfriend and I shared a bottle of wine and 3 apps for roughly $35.00 This place is dark and romantic. I loved everything about it.	0
Up until Friday night, Cookshop was my go-to restaurant when friends visited from out of town. The food is always great, the ambience beautiful, and the High Line is right across the street. But last Friday, when a friend&#39;s cocktail didn&#39;t arrive, and he gently asked our server (with a smile and a wink) &#34;you working on my martini&#34;? He<br>groused, &#34;No, but the bartender is&#34; and walked away. When a different server arrived with his martini sans the 3 olives requested (lemon peel instead) and we asked nicely for the olives, she rolled her eyes and walked away with the cocktail.<br>In the end, our surly server smiled at us just once, when my friend was working out the tip on the bill. Too bad for our server, the cause for our going out was that my uber-generous friend just sold his company for millions. Could have been quite a tip.	0
This is definitely one of the best burgers I've ever had in my life! Atmosphere is great too, and our server was great. My girlfriend and I both tried the Umami Burger, then split the Manly Burger. We loved both of them, but we both preferred the Umami Burger. I've seen people on here say that the burgers are tiny, which is not true in my opinion. I have a huge appetite and after one burger and some truffle fries I was STUFFED, we were barely able to finish the second burger that we split. I'll definitely be coming back here, this place is great.	1
Great selection, yummy items, very friendly staff and fantastic owner that gave us samples when we were unsure about something. We got a smorgasboard of items for a lunch spread and while expensive, it was very yummy. Understandably, it&#39;s all imported and very high quality. They even have wine and beer! Can&#39;t wait to try the sandwiches. Love the imported candies, too! Love the renovation, really classes up this part of Pico!	1
The ramen was pretty good. My regular spicy garlic was more spicy than I expected for the regular but it was still good. However I was very bothered by the fact that when we paid, we tipped a little less than the suggested 18% and the waitress told us that we were $3 short and treated the tip like it was mandatory. I know $3 is no big deal but it made me mad that she would act like we were shorting her on the bill when we in fact were still tipping well. We ended up paying it because my friend didn't want me to make a scene.	0
I&#39;d never heard of Canter&#39;s the first time I went, although everybody told me I should have. And being a Guns N Roses fan, Canter&#39;s told I should have heard of them, too. Well, I hadn&#39;t and aside from the little signs that inform you that Axl, Slash and the boys practically grew up there, I still am not totally sure what makes this place so famous. Movie stars, perhaps?<br><br>Nevertheless, the food alone could pass along their reputation. I&#39;ve never had anything there that wasn&#39;t exactly how I wanted it to be. Nor have I been accompanied by anyone that didn&#39;t touch their food to their lips and have the moment immediately followed by a &#34;Oh my god.&#34; <br><br>It&#39;s delicious.<br><br>My favorites so far have been the turkey philly, the cheese to veggie ratio was downright perfect and the turkey was that just-this-side-of-dry that you need in a chopped meat sandwich. Most recently I went for the roast turkey open faced sandwich. It&#39;s pretty much Thanksgiving on a plate. They also have complimentary spiced pickles that will have you asking for a second plate before your meal even arrives.<br><br>The one star subtraction has to do with the price. Get a salad, a soup, two sandwiches and two beers and you&#39;ll easily have a $60 bill. But I guess if you&#39;re famous, you can charge what you want. Whatever. I go here when I feel like splurging. It&#39;s good food. The decor and the crowd are enough to keep you coming back. I&#39;m sold.	1
Great ambiance. Inviting decor. Nice staff. But hey, you folks have to work on the food. I liked the menu, but you served a Cheese Steak sandwich that was fire engine hot (red chilies) without even asking if that was how the customer preferred it. (And you can't just remove chilies, they leave their seeds and heat behind). The small orange juice is too big for a normal person. Get smaller glasses, charge less. The bread on a grilled sandwich was burned, (which is different than grilled). The Grove has the right idea, but for the prices they charge, the food really needs to improve. Also, I'd like to see more healthy choices and healthier versions of existing choices. Thanks to the location and the layout, everyone wants this place to succeed. And I believe we are just witnessing new restaurant adjustment pains.	0
After two consecutive incidents with the same server, Debra, I&#39;m forced to write this review. First happened February 14th, 2014. My girlfriend and I came in for dinner. She took our order wrong, food came out wrong, runner went back into kitchen, couple minutes later food came out right so no big deal. Debra however pretended it didn&#39;t happen and didn&#39;t even apologize. Again, no big deal. Left her a 18% tip and totaled it to 90$ on my card. On my credit card statement I was charged 100$. <br><br>I Talked to the manager, Alennry, on the phone and said he was busy at the moment so he gave me his email to explain the situation. Emailed him twice over the course of two weeks and no reply. I ended up letting it go, convincing myself it could have been an honest mistake. <br><br>April 12th, 2014 rolls around and I decide their happy hour sounds good, which it is. Don&#39;t get me wrong it&#39;s a great happy hour. Again were sat in Debra&#39;s section. Funny right? This time I total my card to 33$ and I was charged 38$, same thing with my girlfriends card. Now I&#39;m at the point where I&#39;m very upset because it&#39;s clear Debra is forging credit card tips. Being a server in the Vegas industry myself I know this is the biggest no no. <br><br>Now I go in and talk to Nectaly himself about the situation. He seemed very sorry and genuine about the situation and said he would get the money refunded. At the end of the day, the extra 5$ charged on not only one but both our cards is not a big deal, it&#39;s the principle that counts. Nectaly emails me saying he&#39;s getting statements from his merchant. Takes about a week but he finally gets them. Then he doesn&#39;t email back for a couple days and then I finally get an email saying he&#39;s in New York and will refund them as soon as he&#39;s back. I say that&#39;s awesome and couple days go by and no email or refund. I email again and now there&#39;s absolutely no response for a week.<br><br>And now I&#39;m writing this review. It&#39;s upsetting because like I said, their happy hour and food quality is awesome. But this is not the way you do business. The first time could have been an honest mistake but twice from the same server is no coincidence. You don&#39;t steal from customers, that&#39;s not the way you do business. Please take warning. The managers and owners seem to be more than okay with doing shady business.	0
OK Vegans? Vegetarians? I&#39;m just talking to you right now, because my DH and I just had two of the three Vegetarian Sausages at Wurstkuche and they were... Not Good.<br>I had one with Apple and Sage, I think and my husband had the Italian Sausage. Mine was entirely flavorless and his was, and I quote:&#34;just weird.&#34; The fries were bland as well.<br><br>Aside from that, the ambiance is downtown hipster cool, the staff is agreeable and the meatatarians surrounding us seemed to be having a good time. So carnivores, have at it. Next time, I&#39;m downtown, I&#39;m heading for Church and State.	0
I LOVED the octopus taco and mushroom taco! Everyone on here is recommending them, so am I, so definitely add those to your Petty Cash To Do List. The chicharrones appetizer was fun (they make a crackly sound as you dip them in their sauce), but I'm really curious to try the pig ear nachos next time.For drinks, if you know you like fizzes and pisco, get the Nacho Libre for sure. I liked the Banana Hammock, but I wanted more banana. (That's what she said.) If you enjoy brown liquors, get the Fly By Night.Really fun atmosphere, VERY nice and patient servers in spite of being completely slammed on a Friday night. This place is HOT HOT HOT.	1
This is one of those restaurants your friends rave about so much you have to try it. Then when you do go try it you realize you should never ever listen to those friends' advice on restaurants ever again. The fact that it has won so many local people's choice awards is an embarrassment to Seattle and an insult to all the fine Chinese food in this great city. This is Chinese food you'd expect to eat in one of those Midwest flyover states. Even my Utah-raised friend thought this was bland-- and that's REALLY saying something. Take Nancy Reagan's advice-- just say no.	0
I'm giving this 4 stars, but I believe this will become a 5 star review and quite possilby the best restaurant in Madison in due time.	0
Good spot for an early breakfast in Downtown LA. Eggs, potatoes, pancakes, and coffee are all pretty standard in taste and preparation. Certainly has a nice divey feel to the place and I like the CASH ONLY aspect of it and the old school cashier's cage. Haven't been disapointed yet.	1
Good abalone porridge for a cold day. Boyfriend likes the chicken soup ginseng. Good and affordable and good for a cold/cough/sore throat.	1
more like take five gallons of fluid out of my butt. worst food poisoning I ever received.	1
The quality was sub par but it is better than any thing else around there	0
This is, hands down, one of our favorite neighborhood spots. The breakfast can't be beat due to the combination of ingredients, variety and prices. A rare mix off fresh and affordable. I've tried a number of items on the menu and they are all good. It really depends on what you are in the mood for that day.The service, while historically, was spotty and leaved something to be desired timing wise has been on the upswing. The last couple of times I went here the service was friendly and paced well. The food is what has kept me coming back prior to the last two visits.One of the big challenges this place has is that it is mostly an outdoor eating place; great for morning and afternoons but less comfortable in the winter evenings even with the heat lamps. I think if the dinner options were a little more varied like breakfast we might frequent it in the evening more. I highly recommend checking this place out for breakfast and lunches. And dinner if you aren't a SoCal local that is sensitive to lower temperatures.	1
Bruce, you da man with the plan! CHOPPED CHAMPION UP IN HERE. <br><br>PARKING: Valet, don&#39;t go to the Orlando Hotel one. They have their own!<br><br>FOOD:<br>-Duck fat popcorn: YUM! I usually don&#39;t indulge in ordering popcorn, but I couldn&#39;t resist. Definitely worth it for the $5 happy hour<br>-Brussel sprouts pizza: This reminds me of Urbano&#39;s (RIP) sprouts pizza. Fingerling potatoes, sprouts, pancetta, and a nice thin crust. You must order this if you&#39;re a fan of sprouts! I loved it! Huge pieces of pancetta will keep you off your diet. I promise!<br><br>DRINKS:<br>-Margarita: I cannot resist any tequila. This one was super strong. Loved it!<br><br>SERVICE:<br>Considering that Tiffany H. &amp; I came here for a Chopped viewing, service was meh. There were a lot of people here. It could have been better, but I was entertained by Food Network, so no complaints here.<br><br>I&#39;ll be back for the pizza!	1
Surprisingly small venue but a nice enough place for a sunday brunch. Imagine a nighttime view would be nice with lights but daytime was pretty much meh.Service was smooth and friendly, we enjoyed eggs and biscuits that were tasty. The carafe of mimosas won us over though.While reservations are recommended we didn't find it too busy at 11am on Sunday. Oh and it's a bit of a hunt to actually arrive at the rooftop; I know you'd think that would be the easy part. :)	1
This is so overpriced considering the location and establishment. I mean $16 for a plate of fried rice, i pay less in downtown Miami. I could eat a great meal right next door at two other Peruvian restaurants for a third of the price.	0
Had the Manhattan Chowder to start & it was GROSS!!!! Had the Crab & Shrimp Louie for my meal & it was DELICIOUS! My kids had fish & chips and they were great! Great friendly service & they took the chowder off the tab. Go to Pike Place Chowder for good chowder or bisque!!!	1
I usually get the meat entrees but I just LOVE their avocado chimichangas! So crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside. Definitely worth a try! Chips and salsa were just ok.	0
What a wonderful space! Unfortunately those filling it are some of the most useless wastes of oxygen I have ever had to endure.I can't rate the food as we did not dine, but I have a feeling I'm not missing out. The "experience" started with the half wit at the door who couldn't seem to find the words to answer the question, "If we are meeting friends, do we stand in line, or can we go in?" After exchanging dumbfounded stares for a moment, we showed our IDs and were let in. He was displeased by the stickers that my girlfriend put on my license, and looked at me as if I was the one who flunked him in the fifth grade.Inside was no better. It was over crowded with inattentive, incompetent, and rude staff behind the bar. I may have looked past it all if the drink pour was even standard, but the weak drinks were on par with the visit thus far.I suppose one could only expect that the quality of the patrons would coincide with that of the venue. The only person of value and or interest that I met there was another first timer, and similarly displeased.At least there was no entrance fee! *sarcastic thumbs up*	0
This place is old school. It's diner style with seats surrounding a giant U shaped counter. The waiter looks like he has been working there for the last 30 years. The menu is super basic. You're pretty much getting a burger at this place and it doesn't even come on a plate. Just wrapped in paper. After taking the first bite, I nearly ordered a 2nd burger. Probably good that I didn't since a good burger is never necessary. You know how I know this place is truly old school? It's been around forever and could definitely sell beers, but doesn't.	1
Great ambiance, reasonably priced and the workers were<br>Polite and amiable. The pizza was delicious and I like that they have 50% off pizza of the day! The pizza dough was a bit soggy in the middle so it made eating it a bit difficult. But the taste more than made up for it! Would definitely come back for the ambiance!	1
Try the Mahi Mahi fish tacos. They're not as good as they are in SoCal but they're still delicious!	1
Public has a pretty cool vibe. Actually the decor is a bit nerdy (which I love), but most people won&#39;t notice that. The whole theme is &#34;public spaces&#34; or something, according to the host. They attempt to achieve this through exposed brick, conceptual lighting that borrows from the simplicity of bare bulbs, tables and chairs that create an industrial elegance out of metal and wood, antiquated library books on shelves and a filing system circa Nixon, and even a wall of old school bronze mailboxes. If you&#39;re lucky, you can become a member and have a bottle of artisanal wine delivered monthly to your personal mailbox at Public for the price of $50/month. The door to the ladies room looks like a door into someone&#39;s home, and instead of matchbooks they provide a wall of little individually wrapped hand soaps that say &#34;Public.&#34;<br><br>The host was attentive, but our waiter was awful. We were seated with menus, but had to stop a bus boy to ask for water when after 8 minutes our waiter had failed to arrive. Upon arrival, our waiter simply said to us, &#34;So do you have any questions about the menu?&#34;<br><br>Okay, let&#39;s take a freeze frame here. Mr. Madden, please use your special tv paintbrush and put some colorful circles around myself and the waiter, then add some dotted lines connecting us, and write &#34;WTF?&#34; above my head and draw a big &#34;X&#34; through our waiter.<br><br>I&#39;ve been a waitress, a bartender, and a pizza delivery girl. I try to be compassionate to members of the F&amp;B industry, but I happen to believe that it is pretty universally accepted to greet your guests in some fashion (a simple Hello, Good evening, Yo shorty, what your name is? will suffice). <br><br>Once you have broken the ice with a proper greeting, perhaps you can helpfully highlight the specials of the evening, and maybe even offer to take a drink order? I don&#39;t know. That&#39;s just me.<br><br>Anyhow, our waiter couldn&#39;t be bothered. Our table consisted of a square piece of wood that could slide horizontally along a steel beam which supported a dozen other identical pieces of wood. Like the beads of an abacus, you could push them all together to make one big table, or separate them to make many smaller tables. Needless to say, our wood attachment was structurally unsound, which created a teeter totter effect between us. The waiter claimed there was nothing he could do because of how it was attached. Funny, considering that 5 minutes later the host showed up and when we mentioned it to him the table got fixed immediately.<br><br>On to the food. I barely remember it, and it certainly did not atone for the abysmal service. We both had lamb, and salted chocolate mousse + strawberry shortcake for dessert which will run you $75. Everything was &#34;okay&#34; tasting, but I was expecting more. The only thing that stood out was the wine, which was gifted to us by a friend who has a private mailbox at Public. It&#39;s not the most expensive meal I&#39;ve had in NYC, but it was also not very poignant from a food perspective.<br><br>It&#39;s a neat concept but I doubt I&#39;ll be back.	0
We enjoy the open atmosphere, reasonable prices and nice hotel.	1
Whatever you do- don&#39;t get the corned beef hash. By far, a disappointment- the regular cook must have been out the day I had it (apparently some people on Yelp love it) because it was 50% onions and the other 50% was unedible, salty over smoked chuck roast that was chewy. And the other great brunch items are only avail on the weekend. The service is not particularly friendly, more perfunctory than nice and they wouldn&#39;t give us a booth as we requested since there was only two of us (it was a work meeting, so some laptop real estate would have been nice), and I generally don&#39;t like hostesses who are obviously having a slow morning, have three open booths and yet, deny customer service. Not bitter, but just saying- tighten it up, Friedman&#39;s.	0
Last night was our first (and likely last) time going to The Fountain. We went in with realistic expectations of pub food but were surprised by how limited the menu was. A few bar plates, some burgers and sandwiches. Oh, there was one salad listed, but more about that later. Our waitress had little or no knowledge about the beers available, and told us they did not have a list she could show us. Based on her limited and unhelpful information, one of us settled on a Corona, which arrived warm and without a lime. It only took two more requests to finally get that lime (but to give the waitress her due, she did remember it for subsequent rounds.). As for the food, it was hit or miss. The tomato soup was truly delicious, and appeared to be homemade. The chili had decent flavor and a nice kick, but the meat was greasy. The shrimp risotto, one of the bar plates, seemed out of place on the menu, but two of us decided to chance it. It was quite good, but the portion was ridiculously small (maybe half a cup) and included just one shrimp. The burgers were also very good. The sweet potato fries were commercially made - tasty but nothing special. The menu offered no description of the market salad. The waitress told us it featured pickled asparagus and cherry tomatoes, but it arrived without either of those items. When we pointed this out to the waitress, she went back to the kitchen and returned with a small cup of asparagus, but told us they were out of tomatoes. Overall, the meal was disappointing and the service was worse. The only thing The Fountain had going for it last night was the jazz trio. They were great!	1
The food is high quality and delicious. The menu is somewhat limited. Lots of small plates, not many entrees. Very noisy, not a quiet romantic dinner place.	1
Fine dining. Romantic atmosphere despite in being inside the marriott. The chef obviously was meticulous with each dish. The pear dessert was unbelievable. The entire meal was a symphony of flavors.	1
What a happening popular place, even on a weekday!<br><br>Since the most popular was the french toast, I ordered that. It&#39;s not as delicious as everyone raves, at least not to me. In my opinion (and my friend&#39;s as well), it was too sweet with the extra sweet sauce all over and it would have done better without or at least on the side. I still think the best french toast I&#39;ve ever had was at Nook in Hells Kitchen (New York). But since that&#39;s only about 3,000 miles away, let&#39;s discount that and not even draw a comparison here. Fresh squeezed orange juice was only ok too.<br><br>My friend ordered the spinach/artichoke in a skillet with breads dish. We shared meals:) Oh my gosh, please watch out for the HOT skillet handle---she ended up slightly burning her arm since the waiter did not warn her, &#34;Very hot, please be careful.&#34; This place is good to try once. However, I did not experience anything amazing to return again and again for!	1
A great place for a relaxed brunch. Three different sections of the room are decorated in different themes. The back feels like a room out of the French Quarter in New Orleans. The front is light and airy. Great food, good service.	0
3 words: goat cheese fondue. I only wish they gave you more of it, because it's soooo yummy.The decor and ambiance is really nice, dark and dreamy in the evenings. My only problem was reading the menu. Really tiny letters and almost no light, it kinda made me feel old.Wine selection is nice, and the food is yummy. I only wish there were more selections for vegetarians.Brunch is really great too, and you can get the goat cheese fondue then too!	1
My family and I, all 3 generations and therefore there are quite few of us, not to mention our friends and business associates, have frequented this restaurant since 1981. This restaurant has now been under 2 different names and 3rd ownership. <br><br>The taste and the service however are as consistent and excellent as ever. Whether you are ordering a simple 1 entree meal for lunch or 6-course banquet feast, I have yet to find a more authentic Chinese restaurant.	1
Went here on their third day open, expecting terrible new-restaurant service. What a pleasant surprise! Our waiter was on point, knowledgeable about the menu and offered good suggestions. Food was great! Got oysters, grilled corn, smoked salmon, and edamame soup.	1
Maybe I ordered the wrong thing, maybe it was an off day, but I just didn't enjoy myself at this restaurant as much as other yelpers seem to have.//The food: okay. I ordered the cappellacci dei briganti with pork polpettini, rabe leaves which was salty and tasted like a chinese dish. Friends' pasta dishes were somewhat better, celery root soup was good. Even for me (I tend to finish half of my food), portions were tiny for $17/dish.//The service: The waitress that night didn't seem to want to share her knowledge of the menu- there were a lot of words we didn't understand on that menu (polpettini, sugo, rabe), and our waitress replied in one-word answers, gave us a recited speech when asked for pasta recs, and when we were about to tell her we needed more time to decide she was already 5 feet away. We ended up looking up the words on google.//The ambiance: wooden interiors with a touch of hipster-vibe, intimate. loved the candles in mini beakers. Most of the people there on that Wednesday night seemed to be on a date.I seem to have more things to say about the service than the food, so bottom line: flour+water is not worth the trek out to the mission when there are better pizza/pasta places near home (the richmond) and work (pac heights).	0
Me and my fam&#39;s been coming to this place since over 10 yrs ago, and the quality of the food still reminds on the top of my all time fav food list. Sushi is always fresh!!! And they open late! Love Love Love Oomasa!	1
This place has updated it&#39;s menu and my oh my is it delightful. The Service, as always delightful, as is the view, the ambiance and the crowd and now the menu is to match!! <br><br>For starters the Chef sent us sashimi to taste, with pickled cantaloupe and artichoke hearts. To absolutely die for. <br><br>We each had an order of the Fish Tacos and for dinner I had the Arctic Char and my friend had the Snapper. Both were insanely delicious. We finished it off with a shared strawberry shortcake with lavender ice cream. Paired with the perfect Rose over a lovely sunset. <br><br>It was simply amazing. I&#39;ll be back soon.	1
Yeah..but no..no snap to my hot dog..everything was soft...good service but product was not to my liking....	0
Best bagels I've ever had - especially the everything bagel with sesame seeds poppy seeds and salt.	1
Truly a unique and wonderful experience. We arrived late after having called to let them know and hardly had to wait. Once seated the staff all made us feel well taken care of. Now the food.........OMG really really great! And I have to say my boyfriend is loves steak tartar and is always asking me to try it and I do and have never enjoyed it. I try it because I have noticed its very different in every restaurant. Well at Church and State its nothing short of Amazing......the best part of the meal that night and thats saying something. Give it a shot with the mustard yum yum	1
Red sangria gets a solid rating for not being sweet and having great happy hour pricing ($5 for a large glass and pitcher special too). Servers were very friendly. Place was packed on a Monday night - good sign.<br><br>Food was disappointing. Chorizo was overcooked and the chicken and ham croquetas were average. Patatas bravas were soggy instead of crispy/crunchy and the sauce was so spicy it over powered any other flavors. <br><br>Go here to relax with some friends over sangria and get good service but not a real food destination.	0
3 words: overhyped, overpriced and overly-salty <br><br>Food was too salty. even desserts were salty. <br>Atmosphere was chill and dim. <br>Waitress nice but came to the table too often. <br><br>Two stars. I&#39;ve had better.	0
very friendly staff, quick service and very good sushi! Came here two nights in a row.	1
I am addressing this to the new owner and the management at Canter&#39;s:<br><br>Way to go guys, you took what was once an iconic eating place in Los Angeles and one of the greatest Jewish delis on the West Coast, and turned it into fake deli that serves pork while nixing the perks and amping up your prices. Way to go. <br><br>A tradition of Canter&#39;s and Jewish delis in general is to offer complementary pickles. Well, no longer at Canter&#39;s. Now you have to pay for them. <br><br>Pig meat at a Jewish deli? What the hell? If people want pork they can go somewhere else. Hey, why not add Chinese food to the menu too, you ass. <br><br>They have like 5 or 6 types of rueben sandwiches, including a vegetarian option. What the hell. JUST SERVE A TRADITIONAL RUEBEN LIKE YOU USED TO!!!<br><br>And paninis are on the menu now. LAME. <br><br>Do Jews even run this place anymore? If so, they must be the ones who killed Jesus. Because they killed the awesomeness that used to reside here. <br><br>I am never eating here again. There is that other Jewish deli Greenblatt&#39;s on Sunset that still serves a normal simple menu without pork products and that offers traditional Jewish comfort food. From now on I am going there.	0
overpriced tasteless garbage. $14 for a breakfast burrito. the tortilla was good but that's about it. decent size but could get something just as big at half price. i regret adding bland chicken for $3. that's right, it doesn't come with meat. no, it's $11 for a meatless breakfast burrito. total rip off. glad to have paid for their Hayes Valley rent...	0
I&#39;ve found myself at Doughroom quite a few times when visiting a friend in Palms. I love the food, the beer list (both draft and bottled) is pretty solid, and the ambience reminds me of many places I love in Brooklyn. It&#39;s a great neighborhood joint and is the perfect little date spot.<br><br>I&#39;ve had a few of their pizzas - Bianco and Flying Pig were both pretty great. I had the pappardelle with bolognese on my last visit and that was super delicious. I hear the calzones are to die for and I&#39;ve heard great things about the garlic knots. Definitely a well balanced menu executed right.<br><br>I think I&#39;m always up for a visit because of their rotating craft beer list. I just had the Drake flight, which was a variety of five beers for $16. A bit pricey for a flight, but it did not disappoint :)<br><br>It seems like they are trying extra hard to boost the service too, so kudos to them! The manager (or owner?) was extremely attentive on my visit last night. I already know I will be back!	1
Meatball Shop left the worst taste in our mouths. Bouncer is a complete dick. Don&#39;t waste your time walking there. They say they are open til 4 but wouldn&#39;t serve us at 1:30 on a Saturday, never again. Replace your bouncer, you&#39;ve already lost customers.<br><br>I would rate negative if I could.	0
I really love this place in Madison. When I moved here from Spokane, Icon left a great impression on me. I had a great time the first time I went there and they were even playing one of my favorite movies (The Thin Man) at the bar. It became a go to celebration place for me and so I am willing to overlook some of Icon's faults. First off, this place is not cheap, especially if you get wine. But they have an excellent wine selection and for those with more pedestrian tastes in alcohol (myself included), they have beer too. Not everything on the menu is of the same caliber. Some menu choices are excellent (ex. braised short ribs) while others may miss their mark. Because this is a tapas bar, take a friend and plan to share multiple dishes. The size of the serving tends to be smaller and so it's better to split three or so dishes with another person. For the first dish, I enjoy one of their flatbread selections. Second course? I almost always default to braised short ribs (those are amazing). For desert, I like the tres leches. This is a nice place for a treat with a good ambiance. Or you could just have a drink at the bar.	1
WOOF. this place is Ful-FILL-ING...<br><br>alligator meatballs. a must have. a must must MUST have.<br><br>i always get the gem and avocado salad. totally satisfying.<br><br>uhm the huckleberry dessert? melt in your mouth.<br>the sundae?? faBOO.<br>the espresso over ice cream.. mmmmmmmm.<br><br>rigatoni. get it and live happily ever after.<br>the corn... i could eat that for a meal 24/7.<br><br>uhm have u had the 15$ prefix special on mondays? if not, what are you doing nxt monday.. oh going to little doms.<br><br>pizza pizza pizza yuummAAAAYYY... get an egg on it!<br><br>bone marrow.. tiny, but whoa its bone marrow so ok let&#39;s do it!<br><br>anything with burrata cheese YES.<br>grilled artichoke. great.<br><br>totally satsified.<br><br>cute how you serve your bread.	1
A review for the staff and locale: both are fantastic. I shot a surprise engagement dinner here: he photos some of the best I&#39;ve taken, due to the excellent location and decor. The staff however, were the shining light - they were not only extremely gracious and helpful in making sure the surprise well timed (all while keeping the rest of their customers taken care of), but they were genuinely excited and interested without being intrusive. I was excessively impressed.	1
Stopped in for brunch today. To start, the coffee was lukewarm. I asked our server if she could get me a hot cup. She returned a few minutes later with another cup of lukewarm coffee. The folks with me asked for some tea. That just never came. As we waited, she folded napkins while chatting it up with her co-workers.We all got the grits and duck, which was not very good at all. The grits had zero taste and the other ingredients were so-so. The ambience is eh. If you're looking for fratboy college rock, well, you'll probably like it. I was waiting for some Rush.All told, not a good experience.	0
Came in with my bf. Wanted a 4 top. Was sent to upstairs. Was given a 4 top upon seating but then they broke up the table.. uhhh ok.. Two sport fans came in, and was seated right next to us when the place was half empty. I had to scream across the table to my bf. Super loud music. The atmosphere is more for a pre-game kinda thing before hitting up the clubs. YEP.Cheap eats right? Uhh not really. I'd rather pay $2-$3 more for my entree at the King of Thai on Clement since the portion will be 3x more. Cliff notes:Loud music (upstairs)Small portioned meals (com'on I like to be full when I leave)Shitty serviceI miss King of Thai on Clement!Yelp let me down for this place :(	0
This restaurant use tap water it has a wierd smell, Drinking Water and all of Kim Chi Soup/Miso Soup too.Galbi quality is very bad. Terrible.It's hard to get meat and you have to wait long time to see server again.The servers were very fast only time to pass the bill.	0
Had umami last night it was awesome. I recommend this place if you like burgers.	1
Pretty open bar but SO many people and impossible to get a drink. Nice place to just kick back and relax, but a bit out of the way. I think there are better places in the Mission and in SF as a whole...but not gonna lie, the barrels were pretty sweet. Almost like a primped up frat house	0
Came here on a Friday night just for drinks. Food pictures and the food people were eating looked enticing though, will have to come back to try the food then write another review.<br><br>Details:<br>-They have Happy Hour (HH) from 4-6 PM (not 100% positive, but I think only Mon-Fri).<br>-Get there before 10 PM if you want to go up to the rooftop without waiting to see the amazing views of the downtown LA skyline since they have a certain number of people they can only let up there. After 10 PM, a friend who was lagging had to wait about a half hour to come up to meet us on the rooftop.<br>-We had a difficult time locating it from the street as we were driving around. It&#39;s a little obscured. There is street parking, valet for $8, or private lot parking in the surrounding areas for various prices.<br><br>Minus 1 star b/c: we were bummed when we found out we could only eat on the 15th floor, not on the rooftop. We really wanted to try the truffle cheese fries among other things. To eat on the 15th floor, you either have to have reservations or scrounge around for bar seating or these random couches that don&#39;t have &#34;reserved&#34; signs on them. Another reason for minus 1 star: there was only 1 bathroom for women and 1 for men on the rooftop that we could find. Women were waiting a long time to pee (and that&#39;s not good if you&#39;ve had a few cocktails)!<br><br>But all in all, I&#39;m glad I came here. Now I know it exists, I will most likely be back to try the food during HH or come back for another girls&#39; night out.	1
I made a yelp account just to comment . This place is horrible I ordered the churasco had no salt	0
My wife and I went to this place on a Friday after seeing some good reviews and knowing that it&#39;s located on a very nice spot, close to a nighclub, so we could eat while paying attention to the nearby people.<br><br>My wife ordered a Mac and Cheese Bacon Burger and I got a Original Smash-Burger.<br>We both agreed that this was a overly expensive burger for its quality. The burger seemed huge in size, but you&#39;ll notice that the burger patty is very thin actually, the big size of the burger is basically because they use a bunch of cabbage and the bun in tall, you can confirm that from other people&#39;s photos here at Yelp.<br><br>The fries that came with the burger were a joke, they were probably worse than McDonald&#39;s, and came with a ketchup-like (which was probably just ketchup) sauce.<br><br>The drink my wife ordered (named Smoke and mirrors) tasted and looked great.<br><br>Service was good, nothing really special about it.<br><br>We will never go back or recommend.	0
So wanted this place to be great. We've given it so, so many chances, but today was the last one. After months of dealing with wrong orders, overpriced mediocre food, and bad service, today my bagel with eggs and avocado (arriving as usual unassembled so I can pay $10 to do it myself) came with a big shard of glass in the middle of the eggs. So done with this place. The employees just stood there when I showed them- I had to go up to the front counter to ask for a refund. Nice one, precita park cafe. You lost another neighborhood family.	0
Loved the food! Would definitely go back again. I honestly was surprised to find such good food in a casino! Thank you for a great dining experience.	1
Aaawww-this place was so cute! I loved everything about it as soon as we walked in Thursday evening-the hanging lights, the open kitchen, the beautiful bar, etc. Definitely didn't feel like I was in downtown LA. It was a little empty when we arrived, but that didn't last. The menu was traditional French bistro fare. Truthfully, I glanced over most of it, then became instantly fixated on the duck confit(what can I say, I'm a sucker). My hubby, who is a mild foie junkie, ordered the terrine of foie gras with port gelee as an appetizer, then the short rib for his entree. Friends ordered the steak frites and the loup de mer(sea bass). The terrine was excellent. Served with brioche toast, it was like an adult savory pb and j. The foie melted on the toast and in my mouth. The gelee provided enough sweet acidity to cut the richness. I probably could have eaten the terrine and buttery brioche until they wheeled me out on a stretcher. The entrees were lovely. We each shared bites with each other. The sea bass, although it was the smaller portion of the entree, packed a big wallop of flavor. The skin was perfectly crispy and the fish tender and well seasoned. The hubby's short rib was yummy. My duck confit was great. Made even better with the discovery that the accompanying potatoes had been enhanced with the most magical of ingredients: BACON! The red cabbage was a perfectly acidic foil to my crispy and rich confit. The steak frites entree was good. We were all a little disappointed that the fries weren't a little more exciting. One of our friends had actually been to Belgium and said her fries there were the best. Of course, it's rare that I meet a fry I don't like. Lastly, we decided to share two desserts between the four of us. Just something sweet to round out the meal. We chose the creme brulee and the dark chocolate tart. The tart was all things chocolate should be. The creme brulee was the perfect texture, the perfect carmelization of the sugar, the perfect amount of vanilla bean seeds at the bottom of the ramekin(ok I just made that up). What wasn't perfect was the slight flavor of onion??? I'm not sure if the brulees are stored in a fridge that also houses savory food items or if the cow used to make the cream for the custard had a heavy diet of onions, scallions and/or chives. Whatever the case, it was just enough to make you go "Did I just taste that?" but not enough to make us stop eating it. I know, ridiculous, right? I blame the fabulous wine. All in all great dining experience. As we left to go across the street to Royal Clayton's, all the tables had filled up and I figured maybe they're on to something with that onion-infused creme brulee...or maybe it was all the other great food bringing people in!	1
I usually eat here and love the food, I get the lobster tail and shrimp fried, but this time the lobster smelled like ammonia and had a strong taste in mouth, felt like I was tasting the smell of the ammonia. The lobster was spoiled. I can never eat here again, sadly.	0
The wine list is outstanding. Try the Daou white wine from Paso Robles, its outstanding. The heirloom tomatoes are not from this world. There is nothing better. The lobster is great but the lobster tail could have been a little bit more soft. But anyway the taste is perfect.	1
The best chicken &amp; waffles &#34;ever&#34;...hands down!!! Food took a little long coming to the table but it was worth the wait. #Delicious #Succulent #Mmmmmmmm	1
Nice brunch spot, was chilly at the time but we sat outside anyway. Service was excellent and with a smile bumped up rating by a star. I ordered a simple b'fast combo and it was satisfactory, nothing too amazing. The bread though w the butter, jam and pesto like oil dip was phenomenal...next time I am ordering a sandwich and fries. The vibe was great, waitstaff had great work ethic and overall I would come here again ... Nice date spot, group spot and even a solo spot for brunch...	1
Basically an American chipotle. 5 star quality food but it was very confusing trying to order.	1
The loco moco is sooooo good here.	1
My Wife was craving Ropa Vieja, after having it in Miami, so we stopped in after hearing great things. The food here is awesome. The beef empanadas are the best I&#39;ve ever had anywhere. She thoroughly enjoyed her dish, and the steak I had was perfectly cooked and seasoned. I recommend this place to anyone looking for great tasting authentic Cuban food. Whatever you do, don&#39;t leave without trying the coffee! Parking can be a tough feat, but it&#39;s worth it.	1
I've gotten take out here twice and both times the orders were wrong. For an expensive salad, you think they would get the order correct. It wasn't busy at all and I assume there was no rush in the kitchen. It's not worth it to order lunch for the office when there are errors and, no, you don't have time to go back and pick up a 'fixed' salad.	0
My friend Kelly recommended that I check out a Xi&#39;an Famous Food eatery while in NYC, and I&#39;m so glad she did!<br><br>The restaurant itself was kind of hidden with no other stores nearby. This location just opened up recently. The place was TINY, with only a small counter with three stools for eating in (most people get takeout). Everything inside is stainless steel. The picture menu was posted on the wall, and you order at the cashier (cash only). The kitchen is visible in the back, and everything is made to order. It&#39;s fun to watch the workers make the hand-pulled noodles!<br><br>All of the food was phenomenal! It was super flavorful and the textures were amazing (i.e. noodles were chewy, &#34;burger&#34; buns were nice and crispy). <br><br>The best part of this restaurant is the price. All of the menu items are very reasonable/affordable, and it would be a challenge to find better value for your money in this city!	1
This place is delicious!!! It's far from my house but I'll absolutely come back, love their pastrami sandwiches!!	1
Everyone in LA knows that most restaurant kitchens close at 10PM. This is a bummer for unsuspecting out-of-towners and hungry local people seeking a late-night meal (McDonalds and Denny's aside).Canter's is a great place to grab a hot meal, at any time of the day or night. It is practically an LA landmark. The matzo ball soup and pastrami sandwich have saved me so many times. :-)	1
This review is 100% based on the beer. I haven&#39;t had the food. <br><br>I&#39;m really impressed with this place. I&#39;m always skeptical of beer joints that tout their love of European brewing techniques, but Dirck&#39;s does it well. The Augustus Weizenbock was strong, thick, and smooth. My wife really enjoyed her Farmhouse, and we both enjoyed an unnamed wheat cask they tapped before our eyes. <br><br>They value beer, and they do it well. Bravo.	1
I&#39;m from good &#39;ol Henderson and by chance I had to work on this side of town today. Not knowing the area too well I needed to find a nice place for lunch that wasn&#39;t a typical chained place to eat.<br><br>Yelp led me here.<br><br>I ordered my food to go, 4 baked chicken strips, mac &#39;n cheese, 1 BBQ sauce and 1 Honey Mustard. A drink is NOT included with the meal, when places do not include drinks...I opt for the free water. Total was about $7 and some change.<br><br>I got my food to go, went to my car to eat and noticed they gave me the wrong meal. Went back inside and they realized their mistake, switched it out, and I went back to my car. I received two honey mustards with my order and no BBQ.<br><br>The food was good for what it was, but I felt like a lard ass after I ate the extra cheesy mac &#39;n cheese. Next time, if there is a next time, I&#39;ll opt for the veggies.<br><br>The male employee with the braces was extra nice though, I&#39;d give him 5 stars on his customer service!	0
I get it, I get it. This place is an anachronistic Los Angeles establishment. Hey, I&#39;m all for &#34;steeped in tradition&#34; types of places, but I can&#39;t seem to like this place all that much. Even after more than a handful of visits.<br><br>From the outside it looks like you&#39;re looking at a sepia toned photograph of a restaurant from yester-year. Step inside and it looks like you&#39;re in the middle of a small town diner. Peer around your table for a menu and you&#39;ll find that your menu, instead, is written on chalkboards mounted high above you. Sounds great, right? Right, but this is where the love affair ends.<br><br>You&#39;d find better service if robots took your order. The complimentary bread tastes only slightly better than the kind you&#39;d get from CPK--which is to say, really generic. Your food tastes as if it was left on the grill or fryer for 2 minutes too long. As for its long running 24/7 operating hours? I wish the would close every once in a while to steam clean the walls and tables because it feels sticky.<br><br>I&#39;m not going to lie, I&#39;ll probably end up eating here again just because, in a rush to get to a Kings game across the way, there are few options. I&#39;ll still probably regret it but I&#39;ll still probably hope that it can redeem itself.	0
Fantastic food that is authentic Cuban! Finally!!!	1
We had great expectations and left severely, severely disappointed, and brutally hungry.<br><br>We had five people and ordered for five ($20-25/head) and felt underwhelmed by the food quantity and quality. <br><br>The service is terrible as the one lady who served us was bitter and annoyed. Banchan was refilled with a lining of bitterness and annoyance. <br><br>Food is mediocre and will never come back again.	0
I don&#39;t know exactly what I was expecting, but whatever it was, Luna Park wasn&#39;t it.<br><br>Don&#39;t get me wrong, the food was solid, the service was fine, the wine was actually quite good (2003 Ravenswood Cabernet), and I liked the art on the walls.<br><br>The mac and cheese was delicious; I really liked the addition of broccoli. Dessert was nice - on Trisha L.&#39;s recommendation, I tried the warm cinnamon toast bread pudding with vanilla custard (looked more like creme anglaise to me, but whatever.) Tasty, but just not...perfect.<br><br>I sort of think I was looking for Luna Park to be a little more upscale and a little less casual. I wanted it to be spectacular, and it was just okay. I didn&#39;t get that head over heels feeling I get when I go someplace amazing or exciting.<br><br>Look, Luna Park, you&#39;re obviously a lovely establishment. I appreciate the effort you put into looking nice and serving good food, and even the fact that your prices are decent. I just don&#39;t think there&#39;s going to be anything between us.<br><br>Really, it&#39;s not you, it&#39;s me. But um, take care, and keep in touch.	1
You guys probably thought my reviewing days were over. SO DID I!...until my boyfriend moved to South Slope and Krupa Grocery came into my life.<br><br>I have been to this place at LEAST five times since they&#39;ve opened, often in the span of 14 hours--because I just like them that much. It&#39;s easy to look at their menu and think they&#39;re probably overdoing the weird food combination thing, but they&#39;re really not. Krupa is a cozy, unpretentious neighborhood spot with lovely people and yummy food.<br><br>Here are the Cliff-notes:<br>-Everyone who works there is super attractive and super nice.<br>-You can go there for hot morning beverages and pastries; weekend brunch delights; as well as lunch and dinner fare. It&#39;s a resto for all seasons.<br>-Some people have complained that there&#39;s no menu on their website. That has been resolved, although you should know that it changes quite a bit.<br>-They have lots of good beer, a good amount of decent wine, and very little in the way of girlie fruity fancy cocktails. Not saying their cocktails aren&#39;t fine, but if you like girlie fancy cocktails like I do, Krupa doesn&#39;t have much of them. Get a glass of the lambrusco instead.<br>-Most everything I&#39;ve had there is great. BUT if you get nothing else, you should absolutely get the gnudi (dinner) or the gnocchi (brunch). They taste like getting a warm hug. They sell out all the time, and once you try them, you&#39;ll understand why. The Chicken &amp; the Egg starter is also delicious, and I&#39;ve enjoyed the chocolate brioche French toast, hanger steak, and Montauk squid to great success.<br><br>Worth a visit if you&#39;re in the neighborhood! They&#39;re pretty new, but from what I&#39;ve seen, they have some definite staying power.	1
Great restaurant. Delicious food!!! Ribs, chicken, drinks, everything delicious. Service kind of slow because the restaurant is new but the manager made up for it so give them a chance.	1
Easy to make a reservation- got lucky with an 8pm timeslot on a Saturday night. Good food at reasonable prices. Drinks are a bit pricey but that's to be expected on Newbury St. Service was so-so; our server wasn't very attentive and, in fact, we found another server to bring out the birthday dessert as our server was no where to be found. I'd still go back; overall, we had a great time	1
Sadly no where near as good as it once was. From service to pizza, this establishment had gone downhill in the last year b	0
There has got to be something wrong with me! Canter's is my spot for post-late night recuperation. Serving the needs of the night owls across LA, this place is open until 6am.They specialize in Jewish delicacies. I am a big fan of their pastrami sandwich. It's pricey at almost $10 but open late and has a private lot. There is also live music next door. I've hung out here for HOURS and just talked to friends. If you're ever in the Hollywood area and need a good place to hang out and have a decent meal, this is your place.	1
MSG!!!!!!!!!<br>this is not real sul rung tang.	0
The decor in this place is really cute. It reminds me of a cool Seattle coffee shop. Unfortunately for me, the decor is where the charm ends. <br><br>This is one of those partial service establishments, where you order at the counter and serve yourself for things like beverages, condiments and water but they will bring you your food. If you&#39;re going to run an operation like this, the food either needs to be decently priced or it needs to be really good. Think Huckleberry in Santa Monica. Paper or Plastik Cafe had none of those things going for it. In a nutshell, it was bad service for over priced food that wasn&#39;t very good. <br><br>When my husband and I went to order at the counter, at 10am on a Friday, they were already out of half of their menu. There&#39;s nothing that vexes me more than a restaurant that runs out of things... especially when the menu is small to begin with. The only reason for this is poor planning/execution on the part of management. <br><br>My husband ordered a plan B option (they were out of huevos rancheros)... a breakfast sandwich with regular bread because they were out of biscuits. I ordered the asparagus omelet and the Zambia coffee. <br><br>They brew the coffee using a Melitta which I thought was cool at first.... but the consequence of this is that the coffee gets cold quickly. My coffee was lukewarm by the time I got it and I overheard somebody go up to the counter with the same problem. The guy behind the counter said &#34;I&#39;m sorry but we don&#39;t have any microwaves here.&#34; If your coffee gets cold here you&#39;re out of luck. The coffee was not very good either :/<br><br>The next problem was with the food itself. My omelet was just ok. It was packed to the gills with ricotta cheese that was under seasoned. I had to douse it in sriracha just to get it down. The toast it came with was cardboard-y. They didn&#39;t even serve it with any butter or jam. I asked the server for jam and he said they had some strawberry but it expired (note: wtf??). For $12+ this is unacceptable. <br><br>My husband thought his sandwich was incredibly underwhelming. It was on the same cardboard-y bread as my toast and it wasn&#39;t something we couldn&#39;t throw together at home. <br><br>My last issue was with the water which is in a serve-yourself beverage tub near the front door. They have the tiniest plastic 4oz cups next to it. The least they could do is offer larger cups or give you a glass bottle filled with water to take back to your table so you don&#39;t have to get up several times to refill. <br><br>This place might be a cool college hang out (although I hear they&#39;re particularly strict about sitting around with your laptop) but they certainly aren&#39;t a real player in the LA breakfast/coffee scene. We wont be back.	0
Just another rave review here. There is no parking, but the burgers still make it five stars from me. And, the seating is just stools at a counter, very close together. Usually with a wait. Takes me back to the 40s and 50s. My favorite is the hickory burger, with the sauce on the side.	1
I haven't had their food yet but the cupcakes are off the hook. The cupcakes are super intense but SOO good.	0
The new menu and wine list is a great improvement.......we love this place.	1
Having been forewarned that Craigie on Main was expensive, I was pleasantly surprised to learn that there was a fixed price menu that was more reasonable than I expected. While $69 is steep, it was good value considering the experience. That price included the choice of an appetizer, entree, and dessert from an interesting  and varied menu. The extras do increase the bill- my companion's glass of wine was $14. But great care is taken with the food and the creativity is evident both visually and orally.	1
Really good food, good service, and really good prices. This is a nice hispanic quick restaurant. It was pretty busy during lunch but the lady serving us was nice. Not a lot of parking so I had to park in the street. They have daily lunch specials and most plates are under $9.00.	1
Such a great spot! Nice, dark atmosphere and wonderful service. Try the spicy seafood soup!	1
I&#39;ve been here a half dozen times or so now and the sandwiches are consistently good. My favorite is the grilled cheese, with fontina, rosemary and fig. The bread is thickly sliced, either sourdough or multigrain -- I have had both and they are both very good. The staff is very friendly and it&#39;s a comfortable place to have lunch. The side, lately a nice orzo salad with dill, is a bit small and looks a little sad and lonely next to the sandwich.<br><br>The only downside is that we did once order sandwiches sent to the office for a working lunch and a grilled cheese sandwich of any sort isn&#39;t going to travel very well. Good thing they are only a block and a half from the office, so it&#39;s not often that we need to order in.	1
This place used to be good, I think. Went there last week because of Groupon or Living Social or whichever it was, and was terribly disappointed. This place is all hype. Food was so bad, especially for the gourmet prices. Everything just tasted mass-produced, like they bought all the ingredients from Costco. Spinach salad had cranberries and candied walnuts in it, but again, it tastes like how a spinach salad with cranberries and candied walnuts would taste had it come from a Wendy&#39;s $.99 cent menu. Two entrees: Short rib braised beef w/garlic mashed potatoes and Jidori Chicken w/corn grits. It quickly became very clear and obvious that the only spice they carried in the kitchen was salt. Both dishes basically tasted the same, minus the texture of beef vs. chicken. You simply can&#39;t taste anything past the saltiness. The descriptions for both dishes were so promising, but the execution was terribly disappointing. Luckily, we only paid a total of $35 for the entire meal. But what makes this a 1 star restaurant is the fact that our meal would&#39;ve cost $55 had it not been for the coupon. And for $55, holy crap, there are tons of other places to go to where you would definitely get your money&#39;s worth. This ain&#39;t one of them. Avoid it.	0
Followed reviews on here, and plumbed for a safe bet for my first night in SF, VERY disappointed.Chicken was full of grizzle, cheese was bland, service ok, Mojito was good hence the only star wish I had gone next door.	0
Food and atmosphere good but service awful!Between the server and bartender our order took forever and no one kept us in the loop...	1
My husband and I met some friends here, who live in the neighborhood and they suggested this restaurant.<br><br>We arrived first and grabbed a drink at the bar, which was quite tasty. I love St. Germain and the drink I had was excellent. <br><br>When our friends join us, we are seated and all is fine thus far. The waiter was either dense or new...or something. Bread was brought to our table, but no plates. Hello? Really? Don&#39;t bread and plates go together like a horse and carriage? <br><br>The waiter took his time and didn&#39;t seem all that interested in our table, maybe it&#39;s because we were having cocktails and not bottles and bottles of wine.<br><br>The four us placed our orders with 3 people ordering the NY Strip and I ordered the pancetta wrapped pork dish. My dish was decent and nothing to write home about and the same can be said for the NY Strip. It&#39;s just mediocre at best and for that, totally overpriced.<br><br>The dessert was better. My husband and I shared Profiteroles and I&#39;d recommend that if you like ice cream. <br><br>&#34;And, that&#39;s all I have to say about that.&#34;	0
The tacos here are delicious! They are bigger than what you are used to if you get tacos from a truck! It is twice the size of that. I have tried the chicken and carne asada tacos and both were able to satisfy my hunger at the moment. The chicken tacos were okay.. it could have had more of that grilled taste, but nonetheless, I would eat it again. The carne asada tacos were my favorite! It was filled with a lot of meat and toppings on top! At the restaurant, they have a few sauces in bottles. Its fun to just try a whole bunch of sauces, but be careful if you do not like a lot of spice! The bottles are just red and green and you do not know what the spice levels are!<br><br>My favorite dish from this place that I crave all the time like a pregnant woman (i&#39;m not expecting, however.. I just love this dish that much...) is the CEVICHE!!!! Their shrimp is made perfectly and it is so juicy with the sauces they put on top! It is dry-- not your typical wet ceviche but for sure.. THIS IS A MUST TRY dish! It is so addicting. It does not come with a lot of chips so make sure you ask for extra on the side.<br><br>Overall, this place is one of my favorites. It is a bit pricey, but I think it is definitely worth it!	1
This little hole in the wall near one of Highline&#39;s entries has the most the succulent pork sandwich! It also comes with a tasty pickle! It&#39;s a bit pricey but definitely worth it. We&#39;ll definitely come back. Also, it might help if you call them and place your order before you get there; the place is a little tight.	1
This is an updated review. I remember this place to be so good. So my family was in town and we decided to go there. What a mistake. First of all the place was dead and now I know why the quality of fish is not what it used to be. The rolls weren&#39;t as good as I remember it. The service was horrible and the waitress had an attitude so did the waiter. With so many other sushi places to choose from sorry to say I won&#39;t be back!	0
Found the place 2&amp;half years ago and loved the food. It reminds me the small restaurants in France, cozy, tasty food and slow service... But my latest visit in last week was not close to what I remember--food vas like a lousy diner and the price went up...my feeling is they probably changed the chef	0
Very surprised last night when my boyfriend and I tried to have dinner at Almar after Dumbo Arts Festival. We are an interracial couple and the hostess told us we would have to wait 2 hours before we could be seated. We were shocked as the place was half empty. She told us she had not been able to clean all the empty tables yet. Then two Asian girls asked to be seated and my boyfriend heard the hostess tell them it would be 20mins. I asked the Asian girls to confirm and yes they were only given a 20min wait time. I confronted the hostess who started to lose her words as she could not come up with a valid excuse, then I asked to see Mr. Almar himself who basically told us to deal with it. I guess the hostess was following his direction. Don&#39;t seat blacks! For the first time I now know what Josephine Baker felt like when she tried to eat in a NY restaurant that didn&#39;t serve blacks.	0
Manly burger and cheesy tater tots... that's all you need.	1
Ramen is great. Service is usually not with a smile. The food outweighs the attitude.	1
Last night a friend and I ate here. It was so loud we could barely hear ourselves think, never mind talk. And that was upstairs. Beet salad very bland, boring. Chicken with mushrooms, with veggies and potato looked and tasted like cafeteria food. Not worth the money.	0
The food is good. The price is cheap. No delivery service. Pickup only.	0
I loove ramen.. all the different kinds of ramen too! Genki Ramen is located right near my job, "Great!"... so I thought.. Came here for lunch recently, there was a lunch crowd.. but by no means packed. When I walked in there were probably about 6 tables two 2 or three people at each. There were two waitresses and one person helping both front of house and back of house. It took 20 minutes for the waitress to come to take my order, oh and this was after my friend and I waved her down. Then it took 20 more minutes for the food to come out and not once during the meal did they check to see if everything was ok. 20 minutes isn't the best wait for food, but that's more acceptable than waiting 20 minutes for someone to take my order. After the meal, I waited about 5 minutes for the check... not too bad considering how long it took for service. So that's service.. but the food was decent. I would go back for the food, but quite unwilling to put myself through that kind of unnecessary wait for service... on to the next.. there are plenty of options out there.	0
Good food - Great salad bar for the price  and reasonable prices.	1
Absolutely love this place!!!<br>I had grilled chicken with chimichurri sauce.<br>First off the chicken was cooked to perfection and juicy (I hate a dried chicken) and it was big enough for my 2 younger sisters and I to share.<br>We also have tried a veggie pizza which was really good and flavorful.<br>I tried a peice of my dads steak and that was delish too.<br>You just cant go wrong with whatever you order from here. <br>And the only reason I gave four stars was because the restaurant is kinda small but u do have the option of sitting outside, which can get humid...I mean it is Miami. LOL	1
I am SO desperate for a new restaurant in this area that went back to OTD again today, only two days after having an entirely mediocre lunch there. Different order, same result. Vegetarian steamed bun was pretty tasty, but the pho was pretty neutral. Harmless. Toned-down. Boring. And the noodles were wide and too soft. Even so, I will be back. I must be missing something. The salads, I think.	0
As someone who comes from a Russian family (not Russian as in my great grandparents came from Russia in the 1800s and I&#39;m now one-eighth Russian, but REAL Russian - my family emigrated to NY from the Soviet Union in the late 70s), I think I have some authority when I say that Taras Bulba is an authentic Russian/Ukrainian restaurant, a concept that many &#34;Russian restaurants&#34; in the city have failed over the years.<br><br>The food, music, and even the traditional Ukrainian wardrobe makes you feel like you were in a quaint local Ukrainian village. I&#39;ve been to Ukraine and it feels right.<br><br>The food here is good. The countless vareniki and pelmeni are delicious, the salads are tasty, and the desserts are right on the money.<br><br>The service was pretty subpar the first time we stopped by, but that was also just after they opened, and upon coming a second time, it was greatly improved.<br><br>Check this place out for some real, authentic Ukrainian/Russian food. It&#39;s one of the few in Manhattan, unlike Brooklyn where there is an abundance.	1
The star is really for the pretty ambiance. I went there for lunch a few months ago... I live for ceviche, mind you. My date ordered the tamale.. Which I adore as well. The service was terrible. The food even worse. So sad bc of all the hype, perhaps it&#39;s all about &#39;the hype&#39; ...hope they have acquired a new chef bc that is the only way I&#39;m going back ... My ceviche was not tasty at all and I got a platter... And his tamale... ALL MASA! ( Ain&#39;t nobody got time for fat ;)) Where was the pork?!?! Did things get lost in translation?!?! Ugh... I would love to give it another shot, I live across the street, for crying out loud!!! I would be there everyday if I was impressed, which I wasn&#39;t.	0
Excellent find at the Wynn for Italian food.  Dinner was nicely served and was delicious.  Excellent choices of wine by the glass.	1
Meh. The service was good but I came here for the food in September 6, 2014. Everything was just ok. We had a party of 8 and ordered a lot of food. After the first few items came out, we were told they ran out of plates and that if we wanted a clean plate, they would have to &#34;wipe off&#34; the ones we had. The same was true for the glasses. <br><br>Everything was a little oily and underwelming. <br><br>We had the biscuits, chicken cracklins, crispy cauliflower, fried green tomatoes, fried pickles, bone marrow, BBQ oysters and the cheddar grits. My favorite dish was, by far, the biscuits and my least favorite was the oysters. In fact, the oysters were disgusting. If you hate oysters, then maybe you will like these because they taste like gross, salty BBQ on a shell. <br><br>I do not plan to go back. The food is not worth the money.	0
not so impressed with their pizzaaaaaa!!!!	0
I&#39;ve gotten takeout from here a handful of times and its always been delish! It takes FOREVER even if you call ahead but its worth the wait. Their shrimp creole is soooo good one of my favs	1
This place was recommended to me by a friend. We both live in Brickell and enjoy trying new restaurants in the area. My boyfriend and I decided to order delivery from here. My boyfriend and I really enjoy pasta and were told that the food here was amazing. After 2 Hours!!!! We called in to the restaurant to find out what the status was on our order. The person who answered the phone was just as clueless as I was as to what the status was. Apparently they did not know where their driver was and informed me that the driver was not answering his phone! He said to be patient that the food should be arriving because the driver had left the restaurant about 1 hour ago. Perfect.. Lol ... So to be clear... Not only did I have to wait 2 hours for the food but most likely it would be arriving cold! The person advised me to send back the food if it was cold &amp; he would resend a new order when he received the cold food. All I can think is why does a delivery order have to be so complicated?!!! I live just a couple blocks from this restaurant, no more then a 5 minute drive. So 2 hours later I have to order from another restaurant that can apparently handle their delivery orders. I was less than impressed on the disorganization of the restaurant. I&#39;ve heard good things and was completely disappointed when my first impression was this. Horrible service is just as bad as horrible food.	0
Only 4 reviews so far? Is it because it&#39;s like reviewing the Empire State Building? Or because anyone who&#39;d be even remotely interested in eating here, already has?<br><br>The Apple Pan is a cute little cottage on the outside, but the inside is more like the Nick Tahou&#39;s of the west coast. It&#39;s like the gloomiest place on the planet... refreshingly gloomy. I&#39;m certainly not complaining. Diners sit around a U-shaped bar, hunched over their burgers and fries. Inside the U, men in white paper hats, who look like their names would be Homer or Elmer, work the grease. If one of them happens to notice you&#39;ve sat down, he might approach you with an order pad and say, &#34;Talk to me.&#34; You can order a burger, another kind of burger, a grilled cheese, an egg salad or a tuna salad (yikes), fries, and a soda. And pie. I can&#39;t vouch for the burgers as I don&#39;t eat meat, but my friend said they were quite good. When we declined to finish up our meal with a slice of pie (please, I&#39;d eaten a vat of french fries), our server&#39;s face crumpled. &#34;No pie?&#34; he asked, like a child might ask, &#34;No Santa Claus?&#34; Then he gave this look like &#34;I know you two have enjoyed a slice or two of pie in your time.&#34; I felt sort of bad.<br><br>Now an interesting thing happens with the clientele here. It seems that the &#34;local characters&#34; sit on the right side of the room, and everyone else sits on the left. So you have the people who need to take a load off their feet and read their paper and eat some good, cheap food on one side; and the college students, tourists, families, and business people on the other side.&#34;	1
Absolutely love this place. Great food, very fresh and amazing taste! :)	1
TOTALLY disappointed! I can&#39;t believe that The Girl and The Goat is sooooo good and Little Goat is soooooooooooo bad! Asian pancakes HORRIBLE! The Brandade disgusting! The star I&#39;m giving here is for dessert, the blueberry pie is good and what makes it even better is the goat cheese ice cream! But the ice cream is from Black Dog Gelato (amazing!!!) so Stephanie&#39;s pie only deserves one star!	0
This is really a 3.5 star place than a solid 4 but I&#39;ll give them the benefit of the doubt. Their coffee/tea and sweets are top notch but their savory food leaves much to be desired. I really wanted to love this place and feel a little bad for writing a slightly negative review because the atmosphere is awesome and the employees are super nice and very helpful.<br><br>I had the pork sandwich and rosemary fries. The flavors in the sandwich were good but the bread was overly toasted which was enough to leave my gums sore and the fries were soggy which I am not a fan of at all. Someone told me that soggy fries is an east coast thing so that may be why they do that here. My girlfriend had the curry which she also thought was underwhelming.<br><br>The drinks and the sweets are a whole other story, the milky toast and iced matcha latte are must try items. Their Yuzu ginger mint ice tea is also great as well as their pound cake. I hear good things about their shaved iced which I will try as soon as the weather heats up a bit.	1
This was one of the best dining experiences of my life. The food and drinks were fantastic, the service was unbelievable, and the atmosphere was sophisticated. Food and drinks were VERY reasonably priced.	1
The food is good although not as high end as they think they are. Management and wait staff are super snobby ... Service is super slow taking 15 minutes to get a drink and 30 minutes on apps. There are better places in dumbo ...	0
I first went to the Churchill soon after it opened for drinks, and I was completely enamored of the cocktail menu. I had a tequila drink with concentrated hibiscis that was sweet, spicy, and tangy, and it made me want to come back the next week. That didn&#39;t happen--other new restaurants got in the way--but I kept an eye on the food blogs and was always relieved to see signs that it was flourishing.<br><br>A year later, the menu has changed (it&#39;s my own fault that I never got to their bacon drink), but I enjoyed another tequila cocktail, the bulldog, this time with a hint of sweet passionfruit, spicy muddled serrano pepper, and a tangy pineapple backdrop. I&#39;m glad they didn&#39;t go and change everything on me.<br><br>Our food was good, but the wine and cocktails are better. We had a pizza with as much olive oil as you can fit in and on it without it being greasy, which made for a really pleasant texture, but I like a saltier dough. The brussels sprouts had enough oil to actually be greasy, but they were so flavorful as to be easy to forgive. I have a very specific idea of what I think a meatball should be (I have Marcella Hazan&#39;s polpette recipe), and I wanted more fluffiness and flavor out of these.<br><br>But it was still a really pleasant evening because we had the best server. She did everything right--good timing for visiting our table, good balance between interest and distance, good eye contact, good sense of humor, and good sincerity.<br><br>Not letting another year pass before I go again!	1
Brunch is $15 for an entree, a drink and coffee or tea. The portions are gi-normous!<br><br>I love their mixed greens - their dressing is just perfect. The drink portion is good as well. My mimosa was in a wine glass instead of the standard champagne flute, which is a better bang for your buck.<br><br>I had the short ribs w/ scrambled eggs and I have to say it is top notch. The short ribs were so tender and flavorful and the eggs were seasoned and cooked perfectly. Only downside of the dish was the under cooked potatoes, otherwise good flavor. I&#39;ve also had the Three Your Way dish and the eggs are just killer. I never thought of throwing chives in my scrambled eggs.<br><br>I only wish they had maybe 2-3 more options on the brunch menu - maybe their mac n&#39; cheese, which I heard is great. They also have a lot of open space which can hold a good 2-3 more 2 person tables. This will alleviate the brunch wait time. Think about it Eastwick! <br><br>However, I&#39;ve never waited more than 20 mins - which is good? *shrugs*<br><br>Love this place!	1
Same as everyone else, you read about a "ramen burger" and you have to try it. I even brought some home for the family. I loved it, they were not impressed. It's what you think it is: ramen instead of a bun. It made me happy. I would go back in a second.	1
Wow, after hearing so many positive comments about this place, I was shocked at the mediocre experience I had when here. The problems started as soon as my companion and I walked in. The space was inordinately dark for daytime, thanks to the shutters covering every window. The bathrooms were single stalls, which - as every woman knows - is a royal pain in the ass at a bar. I'd met friends for drinks here before, but I was unsure of any protocol as to whether we sat ourselves or not for a late-afternoon meal. We stood there awkwardly, looking for any kind of seat yourself/wait to be seated signs, looking over at the bartender to see if he could help us (he was engrossed in conversation with a patron), trying to find a server (they were all in the back or the other room), and generally receiving no greeting or guidance whatsoever. We eventually sat ourselves.	0
this place is awful. i cant believe it is so popular and busy all the time. is it just because of sex and the city? i really dont get it, the food is terrible... stay away!	0
Went here because of all the rave reviews. My food was greasy and tasteless and I left half on my plate. I was very disappointed.	0
You&#39;ll definitely get what you pay for in terms of atmosphere. The pricy and small steak burger is nothing special. The fries are so-so and felt too starchy. You sit at a crowded counter where you can talk to strangers if you&#39;d like. There&#39;s sandwiches on the menu, which I&#39;d like to try one day. <br><br>I was expecting more from the hype. Thank you Huell Howser!	0
WE ARE NOT A SPORTS BARLast night I dined at The Churchill. We got a table in the front bar area and were psyched about the spot because it was prime for Olympics watching on the TVs above the bar. But around 1030, they shut the TVs off. Apparently the jerk offs who run the place don't want to confuse their patrons - The Churchill is NOT a sports bar! The Churchill does not give a flying f$%ck about America or a world-relevant event that occurs once every four years. Also, The Churchill does not allow you to wear shorts Thurs-Sun. So if you want to eat at a so-so, loud restaurant that hates America and shorts, go to The Churchill - you'll love it.	0
Okay, yeah this place has a lot of good review, but I do not understand why... I came here for lunch on a Saturday. Surprisingly it was not busy at all. However the service was horrible. They didn&#39;t refill our waters until we asked. They came to check in on us only twice. For the food, and for the check. The food was fairly decent. Filling, but not delicious for the price..	0
Ambiance and wait staff were good.very small portions very big prices.main entrees are equivalent to appetizers in size.ordered Bronzino- came out full of bones- gave it back- brought out another piece - still full of <a href="/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbones.fish&amp;s=10065a124bc9ee44d1043235657f140e748914e64599e314ecaa4ec35d89ffd0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">bones.fish</a> stew entree mostly mussels.would not go back or recommend the restaurant <br>Ps- very small wine pours.	0
I think under the previous owner but still pretty good. Something in the broth recipe isn't the same and I think they have cheaper soy sauce. Our favorite pho place still though.	1
Stopped into GG&#39;s a few weeks ago for a drink.<br>Despite the dining room being pretty crowded, we were seated at the bar within minutes. Awesome drink selection, and the bartender patiently explained the pretentious ingredients too us. Can&#39;t wait to go back to try the food.	1
This place is quite the restaurant/bar. It is just what a rooftop bar/restaurant should be in my opinion.<br><br>Came here while I was down here on business. A colleague picked it out and I was pleasantly surprised as we entered the second elevator to reach the Perch (which is so cleverly named). <br><br>We grabbed some drinks at the bar as our table was prepped and we were then led outside to a &#34;window&#34; side table. Great sweeping view of downtown LA and a true &#34;roof top&#34; restaurant.<br><br>I don&#39;t recall much of the food. Not to say it wasn&#39;t memorable but it was a meal after a very long work day.<br><br>I ordered the steak frites. The steak was nicely cooked and the fries were delicious.<br><br>The one thing I clearly remember is the superb waitress we had. She was amazing. Her recommendations (for wine and appetizers) were perfect. She was friendly and chatty, made sure to always check up on our meal and how we were handling our drinks.<br><br>I would come back here for the service alone! Not to say the food and view aren&#39;t worth it.	1
Great food and a surprisingly awesome website in case you want to order for delivery or pick up. The breakfast caprese on a croissant is incredible - so is the lobster grilled cheese. Both are huge too, so you could split an order. Oh, and they are open 24 hours a day!	1
Highly recommend to arrive before 9, if you'd like to get your way to the top. I came here on a Friday night. My boyfriend made reservations few days in advance for 10:30. We arrived at 7:30pm. Made our way to the first rooftop then we decided to go all the way to the top. Let me tell you, it was worth it!! We found an empty couch & we enjoyed our view while drinking a glass of wine until it was time for our reservation. Just know that after 9:30...This place gets packed like crazy! And people start to make line to get to the top. Parking: We parked across the street for $6. Which is pretty cheap since we didn't had to walk much & I was wearing heels. Ha!Location: Is located in a hotel. Nice classy ambiance, some people were dressed up others dressed down (very casual) There is no dress code which is nice in my opinion. Staff: The staffs were so nice. Bartenders, waitress, greeters, honestly, they were really professional. When we arrived we asked if there was a way for us to dine before our reservation. The guy up front ask for his number to call in case there was a cancelation. Which we got to our table 30minutes prior our reservation. And our server Pete was very professional & kind. Food: We ordered filet mignon, it was delicious nothing more to say. I'm craving more right now. Hopefully this review helps newbies and know before time to arrive promptly. That way you can enjoy the place and the view!	1
This may be my favorite restaurant here in Seattle next to Pink Door. The flavors were so robust and packed with the perfect amount of heat that hot sauce or any other condiment was not necessary. We had the jambalaya with a side of spring corn & sweet onion macque choux. These two items went so harmoniously together that if I were to come back here, and I without a doubt do intend to, it'd be hard not to order those two items again. Our service was very friendly not only do I intend to return, but I will gladly refer this restaurant to others.	0
NY style diner, yummy food, go there when you're drunk. Or sober.	1
We were drawn to Blue Agave for the great reviews but were a bit underwhelmed with our experience. The food was overly priced for the quality--I have had much better tex-mex for much cheaper. The thing you are paying for here is the atmosphere and ambience, which is also so so. It is quite loud and not a great date spot--the tables are so big and it feels like you are sitting a mile away from the person across from you!	0
Been coming here a lot and love the food	1
Just waited an hour and 15 minutes for delivery. In the end the pizza was both burnt and soggy. Oh and did I mention cold	0
Friendly service, HUGE shrimp cocktail with fresh homemade sauce, melt in your mouth steaks! Delicious homemade breads. Bring a stack of cash, this place, like most restaurants in Vegas, is expensive!	1
Love this place.	1
So I came here the other night with friends on my birthday. I&#39;ve been coming to La Moon for years since it was at the old location, but after what happened that night I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be returning again. <br><br>We all ordered our food and while we were eating we had a huge cockroach crawl on the wall right next to us. We told the waitress about it and she looked at us as if she&#39;s not going to do anything about it. Then the cockroach proceeded to crawl down the windowsill right next to us, so one of our party had to take of his shoe to kill it. I took a picture of it and uploaded it so you can see what I&#39;m talking about. We showed the manager and he apologized and comped all of our food (which was nice of him) but I will not be returning here.	0
Everyone should check out this place Dune in Atwater, I can&#39;t objectively say bad things about it. Oh except that maybe we had to wait a little for the food but in my book that&#39;s a good thing. I really hate when you order and 2 minutes later you&#39;re already getting served. <br><br>They make the pita fresh and all the ingredients are high quality and as fresh as they come. The lamb was just amazing, perfectly cooked and tasty, not overly salty or spiced up. <br><br>If I was being picky I would say that everything doesn&#39;t yet flow together, there is a bit of downtime between courses and communication among staff seems to be up and down, but let&#39;s just hope this place works and finds it&#39;s style. If the quality of the food is anything to go by, they&#39;re well on their way.	1
We arrived early for our reservation and staff was most accommodating and seated us immediately.  Wait staff was excellent and well=informed.Delightful experience before enjoying the theater.	1
We went back for brunch this weekend. the eggs bennie was fantastic, even my super picky father went out of his way to tell the hostess they were the best he's had in a restaurant. My husband ordered some kumamoto oysters as a treat and they were perfect. The best thing? They had soy milk, AND a great kids menu!! right on PP, you've got a fan in me.	1
Came here for brunch with my girls and loved it. The weather was great so we sat out on the patio - unfortunately they can't serve cocktails on the patio - bummer.The food itself was great and service was spot on. I had the short rib hash and although it was a little salty for my taste the portion was large and it was still pretty tasty! They do have bottomless mimosas and by one bloody Mary get 2 free so this definitely seems like someplace I would come back to.If you are there early, there is tons of metered street parking.	1
IMO, This is the best Izakaya restaurant in LA. Try the uni pasta, homemade hot tofu, and pork belly. The desserts are delicious too! <br><br>The restaurant is small/cozy so it&#39;s best to call ahead for reservations. Service is impeccable.	1
The atmosphere was great and the staff was very helpful. We were a walk-in for dinner during happy hour and the accommodated us with no problem.	1
Took the family to Bitterroot tonight after hearing some good things. Between the whole table we tried the ribs pulled pork pork belly brisket pickled deviled eggs and various sides. Some of the best BBQ I've ever had. My top picks are the pork belly and the brisket. Go!	1
I&#39;ve have the food here and maybe it&#39;s not authentic and maybe it&#39;s not fancy but it sure as hell is good. It hits the spot. You know when you get that craving, &#34;Hmmm, I feel like ordering chinese.&#34; This is the spot. Great price and the portions are awesome. I always walk out full and taking some home. Service is excellent. I&#39;ve never had a bad experience here.	1
A damn fine place for steak and eggs. Iconic LA breakfast spot in Downtown that never closes. The menu is on the chalk board and a few items are always a good bet like steak and eggs or a ham-steak and eggs. Sourdough bread and coleslaw are yummy too. No nonsense service, no substitutions and cash only. If you want a variety of omelets or healthy options, walk down the block to Denny's.	1
I came to this restaurant with a large party (over 15 people) they initially did not want to split our check but after struggling to find a way to pay and 35 minutes later, they took 20+ minutes to split checks and bring the bills to us. This did not include the time it took to get back change and receipts. The service was not very accommodating but the food is excellent. Only come here if you have a small party	0
Such delicious fresh food! This downtown location makes it a prime place to get some healthy food. As most of you know, downtown is known for bar hopping and the famous heart attack grill. So if you&#39;re looking for some healthy refreshing food, Rachel&#39;s Kitchen is the place to go to make up for all the greasy dining! Great for vegans/vegetarians. <br><br>I was craving some greens and needed something refreshing so I got the Spinach salad: It came with fresh baby spinach. bacon, tomatoes, mushrooms, caramelized pecans &amp; goat cheese tossed with lemon herb vinaigrette. You also have the option to add chicken or tuna. I added on the grilled chicken. The salad definitely hit the spot for me. The grilled chicken was perfect, not too dry and it went well with the goat cheese. To be honest, I&#39;m not really a goat cheese/feta cheese kind of person, but it wasn&#39;t overwhelming as I expected it to be. There was a balance with all flavors and I appreciated that because I really don&#39;t even like dressing on my salad sometimes. <br><br>For beverages I tried the Energizer it comes with beets, apples, carrots, lemon and ginger root. I absolutely love ginger in my juices because it always adds a &#34;ZING&#34; to the juice. I recommend this juice for people that aren&#39;t really familiar with juicing, its similar to regular juices and doesn&#39;t have that (sometimes overwhelming) green plant taste. <br><br>Definitely will be back!	1
It was Valentines Day, we were sat promptly, then we sat for atleast 15 minutes or more the bus boy gave everyone around us water, my husband had to flag him down to even get a glass of water. Then finally about 10 minutes after that a waiter came to our table and brought us menus. My question is why doesn't the Hostess give you menu's, didn't make sense to us. Food was good but service was horrible.  Would not go there again.	1
This place seems to have gone down hill. I happened to be in the neighborhood today, so I decided to indulge in some awesome Soy Rizo burrito. However, that awesomeness was nowhere to be found today. The soy rizo burrito was mushy, tasteless and pretty expensive. It seems that someone forgot to salt the rice. On top of everything, the chips were super stale.Just head to Green Chile Kitchen, a few blocks away, for a better burrito. Oh, and if it's Papalote's salsa that you crave, you can get just their salsa to go in a large jar. It's not listed on the menu though.	0
This is definitely one of my favorite locations for Sports Grills. They have a ton of TV&#39;s all over the place so it doesn&#39;t matter where you&#39;re sitting...you&#39;re going to be able to see whatever game is on at the time. The food is outstanding, as it is at most of the Sports Grill locations. The wings are epic! The only reason I didn&#39;t give the place 5 stars is because I had a friend that has his credit card information stolen by someone that works there and charged up his account. So I would recommend paying with cash.	1
I stumbled upon Dave&#39;s food a few years back and I&#39;ve loved everything I&#39;ve bought from his stands. The food is always fresh, delicious and satiating! The only downside for me is the price. Most items cost $5 and the containers aren&#39;t that large. If I were rich I&#39;d stock my fridge with his items though.	1
Went here last night without a reservation. Because it was a Friday night at 7, we definitely faced the consequences (long wait and ultimately dinner at the bar), but it doesn&#39;t matter. This place is ridiculously good!<br><br>They book all their tables as reservations, so if you are a walk in, you wait for someone to not show up for their reservation or until the rush dies down and tables open. The host told us the wait would be about 2 or 3 hours (I think that&#39;s a little ridiculous, but that&#39;s how they run their restaurant and it seems to be working out well for them). We were somehow able to get some seats at the bar after about 10 minutes of waiting, which really surprised me, I think we just got lucky. <br><br>Started off with some cocktails, I tried the dehumanizer, my wife got some fruity rum drink that was incredible and not overly sweet (as fruity rum drinks often tend to be). We also got some starters, which were all on point: Prosciutto, Beef Carpaccio and Focaccia. The carpaccio was outrageous though, I think I could eat that all day everyday and never get tired of it.<br><br>Moved on to pasta, I got the black pepper rigatoni and my wife got the sweet potato agnolotti. They were both absolutely incredible. Finished up with the zeppole: doughnuts and chocolate, &#39;nuff said. <br><br>This place is reasonably priced, but with booze I would say it&#39;s a little more than 2 dollar signs. We ended up spending a little more than we expected, but it was so totally worth it and I would definitely do it again. <br><br>Words of wisdom to enjoy this place: make a reservation, unless you happen to get lucky and eat at the bar. Also, GET THE FREAKIN PIG HEAD. I didn&#39;t try it, but next time IT IS A MUST. OINK OINK!	1
Almost 70% of these reviews are FAKE I mean look at them. They are all worded the same and you can tell. First time. Saturday morning. Asked hostess table for 4. Watched crowds that came after me go in. 20 minutes go by ask hostess when Alex D will be called we&#39;ve watched crowds of 6 and 4 and 2 go in that came after us, she replies &#34;the difference is they are a party of 6 and 2 and you are 4, I quoted u 40 minutes and it&#39;s been 19&#34; the hostess did not even give me a wait time when I checked in I doubt she gave the crowds after us so that&#39;s fail #1 and didn&#39;t explain how that makes sense and was completely rude. I walked away and they asked &#34;so ur canceling?&#34; I reply &#34;yes thank u&#34; they reply &#34;whew okay great&#34; Wanted to try the food but had trouble seating with a rude hostess and her old boss and bad customer management. Will not be going back and giving my business. 900 other breakfast joints in LA.	0
Could not have been happier with our decision to dine at Biscayne. Service couldn't have been better. The food was great. The wine list was reasonable and even offered wines by the glass at a great price. Definitely surpassed our expectations. I would highly recommend dining here.... We will be back next time we are in Vegas.	1
Happy Hour Review	1
We just got home from having dinner at Gampa's Pizza and I am not quite sure what to make of that place. I had a garden salad and the Jabroni (tomato/pesto/mozarella/fresh basil) pizza and the rest of our party had the simple pie with the addition of sausage and a Finnochio pizza.	0
Disappointing. The menu seemed to have changed considerably from our last visit. The dishes were not as a elegantly executed as previously. The flavours were not as distinct & unique. The waitress & host however were very good.	0
Meh, I've had better. I've driven passed this place for years and i finally went in. the service was great. our waitress was there when we needed her and even when we didn't. she even stayed at our table and chatted us up. I liked that. the food was so so. wasn't bad, but i wasn't blown away. would i go back? sure, but it won't be my first choice.	0
This is hands down one of best pork things I've ever eaten	1
My group found the entire dining experience exceptional.  The service was speedy, the personnel were very helpful in explaining our food choices, provided suggestions for additional offerings and were very friendly while providing high quality service.  The food was presented in a colorful and tasteful manner,  Most importantly, it was delicious.  All parties were well pleased with the outing.  I thank the Orleans management for providing a pleasant evening of dining.	1
Koreans can make some tasty wings!After some late night drinking adventures in Ktown my friends and I decided to come here for some late night eats. My friends have been telling me how good the food is here so I was excited to check this place out even at 230 am. My friends and I ordered a bunch of different wings to try. My favorites were:-Spicy soy garlic-Hot wings-Potato wedgesThe hot wings had a really good kick to it and was pretty spicy and I love spicy food too. It was really good. the wings are made to order here. It is probably one of the better wings that I have had. The potato wedges are yummy as well. I can see why this is a popular place to go. Too bad they don't have any close locations in OC...	1
Large portions. <br><br>Attentive staff. <br><br>The skirt steak was delicious and enormous as was everything else.<br><br>America!	1
Not a gang I&#39;d ever want to join. Food was okay. Some things (crab Rangoon and noodle dishes) good and other items (papaya salad - wilted, tuna-didn&#39;t seem fresh) not. <br><br>Servers were total amateur acts - who talked smacked about and to each other in front of us at our table. Manager should probably cut back on the speed (or get some?) - seems like a train wreck who manages through put downs and pressure. <br><br>Overall, a circus. Would&#39;ve rather been across the street at Gigi ... Golden Corral would&#39;ve been an upgrade too. <br><br>Even Miami hipsters will eat this place up- then spit it out.	0
I came here because I was waiting for friends to hop on the train and looked for somewhere close by to have a drink. This place had the highest yelp review so I thought I would check it out. I didn&#39;t expect what I saw. It is absolutely tiny. There are no seats, basically you stand leaning on the bar from which you order. Down one long hallway.<br><br>They have wine and 3 types of beer so if you&#39;re looking for variety or a cocktail this isn&#39;t the place. I decided to grab a sandwich while waiting because everyone there was so happily standing against the bar I figured there might be something to this place. The food was delicious. I had fries and a skirt steak sandwich. At first I thought the sandwich looked smaller than expected but I barely finished it and the quality was much more aligned with an upper scale restaurant. This isn&#39;t a place where you can go and sit down to have drinks and food with friends but if I lived in the area I would definitely get take out from here.	1
i lived in this area for a long time. This restaurant will not poison you. However, if you really want to get a good meal, you must go with a Chinese person. The food in the Clement St. area is more authentic and better quality.	0
Been to Bacios many times and it is always a great experience.  Excellent food, service and ambiance.  Looking forward to my next visit.	1
I have dined in this restaurant for 4-5 times. Orders are pretty fast, while everything doesn&#39;t seem to be very clean.<br><br>Price is good - cheap, dishes are decent sized. I personally don&#39;t like their Handiness Chicken - It&#39;s definitely made of frozen chicken, not fresh ones. The coconut rice doesn&#39;t have enough coconut favor. Also, don&#39;t ever order the Malaysia fried rice - It has no favor at all. There was a few tiny shrimps and green beans - I had to ask for salt just to eat it.<br><br>If you want a fast and cheap lunch, it&#39;s not a bad place to go. But definitely overrated.	0
I haven&#39;t tried their ginseng chicken soup that everyone talks about yet. It&#39;s because I love their abalone porridge so much that&#39;s what I get every time I go there. When you&#39;re tired, when it&#39;s cold outside or when you just want comfort food, the abalone porridge is the best thing in the world. The stewed beef that comes with the side dishes are delicious and goes really well with the porridge too. For me the best part is that it&#39;s open 24hrs. Comfort food at your service 24 hours. How much better can it get?	1
Amazing amazing amazing!!!!! The food is 5 star, the service is fabulous and the belly dancer was great!! We ordered the calamari steak, Swiss chard and the beef short ribs. All were delicious especially the Swiss chard. I wish I had picture to share but we ate it all too fast!	1
This place is awesome all you can eat. Dont limit you to one small bowl to grill. Lots of good ingredients reasonably price. Great staff and excellent t service and freshness!!	0
Loved its hickory burger	1
Not a chilli afficionado like some of the other posters but had great chili dog! Chili was sweet and smokey perfect combination with the savory Kobe dog! Frickin good red stuff! Green was good but the red was were it was at! I'll be back next visit.	1
The food was amazing. Loads of taste. Great presentation. I sat at the bar near the chefs. The preparations were made fresh and with great passion for the preparation. I had the Brussel sprouts( a must have), apple salad, the Halibut, and the apple fritters( extra delicious). Menu changes I&#39;m told. Will be back to this place. Reservation probably best even though I walked in but the only available was by the chef bar which turned out to be the best spot!	1
I ordered for delivery. Took 90mins to arrive and typically I pay credit, but I had cash on hand. The driver didn&#39;t have change, and spoke not one lick of English. <br>The food...I believe all the comments on this forum have been fabricated by the restaurant&#39; family and friends. I ordered the black widow roll, dragon roll and tuna tataki. I wish I would have just made the drive to pick up from Sea Siam in London square.	0
Despite the long wait time on a Thursday night for a non-reservation party of four, I had a wonderful time at Ootoya. <br><br>The ambiance of the restaurant is nice enough to take a date but casual enough to go with some friends on a random night. The presentation of the food was great and the prices seem just right.<br><br>We ordered the Tofu Salad as an appetizer (to split between four) and the tofu was rich in flavor and very creamy. <br><br>I ordered the Salmon Miso Teishoku Set ($21) which was delicious and rather filling. I recommend for everyone to order their entrees as a &#34;set&#34; as I enjoyed the chawanmushi (the egg custard) that came with my dinner set very much. <br><br>Overall, I had a satisfying meal with my friends and I cannot wait to try the other items on their menu. This place was definitely a pleasant surprise.	1
I cant believe this place has been here for so long and I never knew about it! Perfect Mom N Pop shop located in an aged part of Vegas. <br><br>Very casual spot with many regulars who frequent ( i would definitely be a regular too if i lived in Vegas) I had the rotisserie 1/2 chicken with rice and hot potatoes as the sides. Delicious meal with attentive service. The whole staff seemed to communicate well like family.<br><br>Heard the Chicago Style Dogs were pretty tasty too! I will definitely come back for those. Filling and Satisfied!	1
Simply the finest sandwich in seattle. #1 or #2 don't waste your time with anyother sandwich, the cuban press is up there, but pales in comparison.	1
My friend has been having treatment for cancer. Several friends and myself made reservations here to celebrate her treatments coming to an end as well as her birthday. She actually made the reservation for 6 and totally forgot to count herself. We got there and they said we only have a booth for 6. We asked if perhaps 2 people could sit together somewhere else and were told no- we either cram into the booth or the wait for a 2 top was 80 minutes. There were 2 extra rooms with tables that were set and not being used.The hostess(on advice from the maitre d') said it was only for special occasions. After suffering through a crammed table of appetizers and my back hurting from being twisted on the end, I gave up and took my meal to go so the others could enjoy theirs. I heard a lot about the bang bang shrimp- it was ok but nothing special. The entrees were small and expensive. The waitress left after only getting 1 appetizer order for 7 people without checking if anyone else wanted to order. We placed 3 additional appetizer orders which all came much later than the first. Needless to say, after the poor attention we received from the front of the house- I will not go back. I work in a service industry and don't think I would recommend it to my clients. I am eating my entree out of my styrofoam take out now. Unfortunate- it tastes pretty good, but I know I'll still be hungry after.	1
awesome place to grab a drink! good craft beer selection for great prices. this place is almost am oasis among a bunch of warehouses and factories. would love to go back to try their food sometime!	1
Sadly, all good things come to an end and such is the case for Kogi King. <br>This was my go-to KBBQ place, but after a disappointing visit I am never again stepping foot in this establishment. <br>What happened to the variety of banchan and the quality of the meat? <br>How about the excellent service? <br>Waiters used to be so attentive changing your grill every so often and checking to see if you wanted more meat. Now they&#39;re hardly within sight, careless, and rude. <br>The waiter attending my table not only charged my friend and I twice, but had us waiting 20 minutes to give us our cards and another 20 to fix her mistake. And after having us waiting like idiots still has the cynicism of DEMANDING a tip. And I mean DEMANDING because our waiter and her coworker followed us to the parking lot. You seriously expected us to tip you after the lousy service? <br>Farewell Kogi King. You have lost not one loyal customer, but my whole party of six.	0
Nice place - especially the alley way with the draping lights! And it has a live band too - really good atmosphere!<br><br>The food is really really good. We got the Far Bar Burger, the mushroom burger, the aloha roll, 4 cali-yelp rolls (spicy tuna with avocado on top), wasabi fries, a thai chicken pizza, and a side of regular fries, and two draft Sapporos... all for a little over 40 dollars.<br><br>use the yelp passport thing! it&#39;s definitely worth it.<br><br>It&#39;s a very attractive place... llol	1
I don&#39;t get it/..just left one of MOmofuku restaurants...saan...the crab was<br>Semi frozen and trying to remove frozen crab from it&#39;s shell with a <br>Butter knife &amp; a fork from the cafeteria from high school was impossible..<br>The soft shell crab was ok but, again not easy to share(yes, I know the<br>Chop sticks on the table were ornamental but useless in our case)...<br>And most if all, the &#34;server&#34; was all but mute and uselss cause she actually barely spoke and was truely useless from explaining the cocktail<br>Menu to the interesting food selection ...nice try but NO THANX	0
This place is amazing. We had a mix of items family style, not a single one disappointed. The decor is beautiful, mixing classic Italian with a modern vibe, its literally the best of both worlds. You should try the shrimp scampi, the meatballs or the whole fish dinner, absolutely awesome!! We will be back without a doubt!	1
If you want the absolute best Thai food in all of Nevada, mixed with the most amazing customer service then MK is a must have!	1
I wasn&#39;t impressed. Location was really small, the wine was $38/bottle which was ok but they added 18% tip to the bill &amp; we were a party of 4, bad taste if you ask me. &amp; judging from the hype on yelp, I was underwhelmed.	0
This new sushi/Thai restaurant is surprisingly good. The sushi and sashimi are always fresh, and they have an awesome $10 sashimi lunch special. only downfall is that they don&#39;t have a sushi menu yet, so you either need to know what you like or have the server go through their signature rolls off the top of their heads. All-in-all it&#39;s a good place to eat in the neighborhood. Haven&#39;t had their Thai food yet, but I&#39;ve heard good thing about it.	1
This restaurant is great for the Thai food but the sushi was disappointing. Probably will not go back because I&#39;ve gone three times and each time I go they always get my drink order wrong and then the waitress will tell me I&#39;m wrong.<br><br>For instance, I ask for a glass of rose, all of sudden I get a champagne flute with pink champagne which I DID NOT ask for. Then I say, I did not order this and then get told that&#39;s a rose. <br><br>Because these instances, I do not think I will be returning...which is unfortunate since I love the vibe.	0
Honestly...galbi jjim sucked butt. No veggies inside...flavor was whatever. My mom makes galbi jjim ten times better with better ingredients. <br><br>Considering this is one of the very few that serve up galbi jjim I can see why peeps be crazing over this. <br><br>Go deung uh jo rim (braised mackerel) and go deung uh gui (fried mackerel) sucks as well too..<br><br>Would never come back..not worth the money.	0
Get the chipotle hummus and the chocolate pudding.	1
I called to make a reservation and was told that they don't take any for parties under 6. No problem. How long a wait for a table at 8 	1
This place is crowded with tourists, and is overpriced. I had gone to the bathroom before I left and saw a gentleman come out of the stall with a chef&#39;s hat on and did not wash his hands before heading out the door.	0
Trendy, ridiculously crowded, service is a little uneven, and kind of pricey. Ridiculously crowded needs to be emphasized, as there's ALWAYS a line for a table.It redeems itself, though-- the food is quite good (The Oscar, the Protein, two create-your-own-omelets, and something else were all quite good) although the bread is rather ordinary, and the people watching is excellent if you're too young for the crowd at Urth Cafe or some other spots.Not to mention the outside seating, well, we were seated right by the entrance, so we had seriously good people watching position. It's not somewhere I would go regularly, but on a beautiful morning like this morning to a place I only rarely frequent, it was worth a visit.	1
Pizza was ok, with nice flavor but waaaay too crispy. <br>Weird staff. Our waitress was like a robot. Not one smile came out of her the whole time.<br>Specials were very expensive. <br>Service was poor and food took forever to arrive. When it did, it was cold. <br>Area is ugly and dangerous. Not worth the trip.	0
I was pleasantly surprised by the interior. It is gorgeous, clean and welcoming. We were seated as a cozy, private booth that gave you enough space while also being intimate.	0
The restaurant was OK, not great. The duck carbonara was excellent. The vegeterian lasagna was all mushroom and bechamel sauce. The crispy calamari small plate tasted frozen and re-fried. Waitress very nice. We had to ask to have music turned down so we could talk. An OK address, but I do not feel any desire to go back.	0
Enjoyed the people at Row House always genuine and helpful with ample advice on the menu if asked. Loved every meal I've had here - need to go back more often in fact!	1
I give it a 4 purely for the amazing waffles. Seriously best waffle...ever! If you decide for it ask for a side of dulce de leche...well its basically condensed milk but its sooo good!	1
Wow! Best breakfast on a long time. I had the Crab and Shrimp Scramble. To my delight it was jammed with Dungeness as well as the large pieces of Shrimp. I'll be back for the food which was accompanied great service and 11 big screen TV's that were HD. Love this place.	1
Unbelievable experience at Craigie on Main! The three course tasting menu is incredible and the service matched the food! Our waitress picked the best wine to go with our meal. You cannot go wrong with whatever you pick!	1
The fried chicken dish was aaaahhmazing. A progressive presentation with a old farm charm.	1
Good food, but there are serious delays in the kitchen. We came in for Wednesday night dinner, the wait staff was attentive, but there&#39;s some problems with delays in the kitchen, and here&#39;s the mess that ensued:<br><br>30 minutes: 1st appetizers, drinks<br>60 minutes: 2nd appetizers. <br>90 minutes: pizza arrives. Great Pizza!<br>2 hours: Entrees Arrive, Delicious.<br>2.5 hours: Desserts<br>3.0 hours: Check please!<br><br>Luckily I had good company, and the food was good, but my gosh, that&#39;s a horrific amount of time to wait for food.	0
Can't really give a full blown review since this was an after thought of a stop on our way out of Madison. My husband and I needed a place to pick up some treats to share with his niece and since I'm a sucker for cupcakes this was what my Yelp research led me to.	0
Staff was very friendly and helped us right away...kid friendly. Had a Hawaiian burger and it was really good. Always had the drinks filled....it looked like it was the place to get get breakfast in Seattle.	1
The price is cheap. Fired dumplings got overcooked sometimes. Let&#39;s take it as a fast food place and not a decent restaurant. Sometime you need to pay taxes by cash.	0
This place has THE WORST serivice ever!!! My friend and I were standing at the front door for a long time, and no one paid attention to us. Then we wrote our names on the wait list, still nobody read it. Then we figure that maybe we can find our own seats, so we sat at an empty table. Still, we waited and waited! One waitress stared at us, then went away. After that, a waiter came to us, and asked us if we reserved the table, we explained the situation, he still asked us to wait at the door and write name on the waitlist again!!! We were so annoyed and left. Such bad service was unbelievable!!! Don&#39; t go there!	0
Last week I shared an exceedingly delicious and romantic dinner at the Pink Door. Our server talked about the food and wine with authentic enthusiasm.	0
After walking 5 miles from a club to get here, I was in for a treat. Not only were they casual about people sharing their orders but the service is lax and polite. <br><br>The food? No matter what time you come in, it should be a pleasant treat for your stomach. Heavy yes, but mouth watering as well. <br><br>Everyone raves about their sour dough bread because it&#39;s THAT good but make sure you try everything on their menu at least once.	1
Burger was great. The beer selection is incredible! Try the loaded potato chips too! the beer selection was awesome!!!!!!!!	0
Mac Daddy and Cheese Balls.That is all I have to say.	1
Best Omakase meal I&#39;ve ever had. It did cost an arm and a leg but Chef Yamamoto is a genius and everything was incredibly fresh. He made every dish for my private party of 11 in front of our eyes and we couldn&#39;t take our eyes off his culinary skills and expertise. If you somehow get a referral and eat at Yamakase, your life will be forever changed. :)	1
Went here for dinner. Was seated quickly, and service was fast! Staff was knowledgeable and polite. Food came out within 15 minutes, fresh and sizzling. We'll be back! Try the alfredo al limon, tons of chicken and sauce was great.	0
I called in an order of just two items. The woman said it would take about 15 minutes. I came in ten minutes later. She told me everyone was on break and it would be at least 20 more minutes. Gotta love that sesame chicken though.	0
chicken (original)-greasy..in a good way-juicy-garlicky-tenderchicken dukboki-HOT..as in spicy-delicious-good portion sizefries-effing gross..pale and limp...yea....overall. i can't wait to go back because the chicken is frackin amazing.sorry i'm not more enthusiastic in my review. it's Monday man...gimme a break	1
No, if I could give zero stars I would!!! The hostess and manager were so rude. Four of us arrived an hour before we were given a table bit that us NOT the reason why this establishment deserves NO stars. It is because their manager says, &#34;fuck you, get out&#34; after we asked to be moved to a different table since we were split into two. What kind of hospitality is this? Surely this establishment should be out of business.	0
Eff the service and food.	0
This is the kind of place you find out about through word of mouth, I&#39;ve been here a handful of times now because my friend took me. A little hidden but you&#39;ll know you&#39;re there when you see a line full of drunk people, I was one of them haha GREAT corn though and the sweetest old man serving here for 20+ years (I asked him).	1
I came for dinner time. Judging by the reviews, I should've came for brunch instead. +1 love the decor inside +1 great drinks. ~$11 each and come is cute 16oz mason jars +1 bathrooms are clean (yes, I critique on bathrooms) -1 food: we order the ribs dish and the fried chicken dish the ribs were meh. I've had better fall off the bone ribs. the side of fries were good though. fried chicken was ok. I was expecting SOUL food/ something close to roscoes. I guess my expectations were too high-1 SALTY mustard greens. I couldn't even eat it. -1 pricey. for $25 per plate, I would expect more.. Esp from a soul food place. I think I'll come back and check out the hype for brunch	0
This is a nifty little place. We got a whole chicken, half garlic soy/half hot sweet and some fries.Chicken: perfectly fried. Hot is very hot, but also sweet. Garlic soy was absolutely addictive. The decor was great, color scheme organized, etc. The to-go boxes are really cute.I'm not sure what I like more, this restaurant's food or their branding!	1
It's two in the morningYou have the drunk hungerWhere else are you going to go?Where else is going to serve your sloppyDrunkAnnoyingLoudSpittingUglyAss?They speak drunk tongue. When you slur at them for your "chzbils n nickrchits" they'll know what you meant. (Cheese-Balls and Mac-n-cheese).They don't mind it when you're dumb enough to yell at the passing cars and call the girl at the next table "effin' hawts". They will even humor you with a smile when you ask them for their numbers. Because that is why it is open all night. AllNight	1
Its a beautiful rooftop for brunch. Unfortunately my friend recommended the breakfast lasagna...I was starving and they brought out the absolute smallest little sliver of lasagna. My friend was appalled at the size and claimed his portion was never that small. I asked the waiter why my meal was kid sized and he said casually oh some slices come out smaller than others....? Yea..the rooftop is not that beautiful...I ate the small sliver and still went to lunch somewhere else.	0
This place is delicious!!! It&#39;s far from my house but I&#39;ll absolutely come back, love their pastrami sandwiches!!	1
Up the elevator 2 floors, down the hallway, and out on the rooftop, a magical "garden" lies nestled in the heart of Koreatown. Roy Choi's new rooftop restaurant called the Commissary just opened yesterday as another awesome addition to the series of food businesses already running under Choi's supervision at the Line Hotel. The menu offered at the Commissary was as LA Weekly stated "vegetable-driven", with the entire dining room set up like a greenhouse. Sadly, the water today was not served via the garden hose, but regardless, I loved my experience. I'd gladly come again and bring my friends because they'd be in for a real treat. :) I very much liked that we were seated at a large wooden communal dining table with eclectic chairs and mismatched cups, and that there were plenty of hanging plants from the ceiling. I really felt like I was sitting in a greenhouse. And the menu was super cool too! Presented in a yellow envelope, the menu consisted of two cards, one with simple images and identification of each image (i.e. a variety of produce, meats, carbs); the other was a more detailed listing of what each image or menu item comprised of. The whole point of the experience is that you order what you would like to eat, and you leave it to the chef to prepare that respective menu item in the way that highlights that particular ingredient as the star of the dish. My favorites were definitely the following: Under $8.00 menu: b. tomato confit with nectarines, chiles, garlic, and "red sauce": My absolute favorite. I loved the presentation and the juxtaposition of sweet, juicy, heirloom tomatoes with ripe, fleshy, yellow nectarines, and little kicks of heat from slivers of chiles. It was simple, tasty and definitely highlighted the produce item. i. deviled eggs with chives, cayenne, sweet relish and red onion: A nice filling with that nice pickled relish to counterbalance the creaminess. Well done. :) j. grilled cheddar cheese on sourdough served with a tomato sauce and pickle: I felt so naughty eating this thing, but my fork and knife kept gravitating towards that plate. Classic grilled cheese with a crispy outer crust and a tasty marinara-like sauce of sorts. Don't underestimate the power of melted cheese. Under $12.00 menu: a. grilled asparagus with parmesan, lemon and "green sauce" (consist of garlic): Love, loved it! Another great dish and easy to share. It was pretty straightforward, but that doesn't mean it wasn't tasty. I cleared that plate. b. clams cooked in chicken stock with chiles, lemon, bacon, samba and "green sauce": Think steamed clams paired off with some damn tasty garlic bread for dipping into the salty, flavored stock. Um, drool. Say no more. Under $15.00 menu:c. schnitzel made with pork meat served with a spicy mustard sauce and a little salad on top : My date's favorite and I don't blame him. The pork was juicy, coated in a crispy panko crust, and that spicy yellow mustard sauce was just so addicting. Under $3.00 menu: b. garlic bread: Can't go wrong. It's not your typical garlic bread, trust me on this. Get. It. d. hashbrown: I thought it looked like a flattened out bird's nest lols! A potato "pancake" of sorts with crispy edges = hashbrown meets potato chip = genius. Unfortunately, I was not as big of radish plate (too buttery/heavily-coated in sauce for you to really appreciate the bitter spicy bite) or the bok choy (reminded me of vegetables tossed in chili oil which I don't like normally anways), but everyone is entitled to their opinions and preferences, right? Favorite cocktail of the night: White Peach. Light, refreshing and summer-y, and served in a plastic to-go container so you'd sip it almost like you're drinking from a bowl. Use two hands please! Will I be back? Yes. Very unique eating experience with very tasty food and friendly staff. Thank you, Roy Choi, for bringing your vision and concept to light. It was, to say the least, a pleasant surprise.	1
Went to Perilla for lunch today, ordered the chicken pho and vegetarian pho with mushroom broth, the mushroom broth was light and delicious; however, the noodles lacked any flavor whatsoever needing to add extra hoisin sauce provided for on the table. I've had better pho in the avenues.	0
Portions large and reasonably priced. Have to work out service issues as a new restaurant. Convenient to stop before theater and easy parking	1
The wait can be pretty long so get here early. Now while paseo is good it isn't so good that i would wait in the wind and rain for 20-30 minutes for it. Something to think about. You're going to be waiting a while dress for it. :-)	0
Had an interesting experience here. My friend was having her birthday here so I decided to check it out. I was told to use her name at the door to bypass the line outside, but the chick refused to let me in, said she didn't have a party under that name. My friend sent down her friend, one of the bar managers, who was a complete 360 in terms of hospitable. He made me feel very welcome in his establishment and was very courteous to show me up. He also stopped by once we were all upstairs to make sure we were enjoying ourselves. So if you don't get stuck with the bitchy door woman, you'll have a good time.Upstairs, it's nice inside. The main bar is kinda small, but it's really just a hotel bar. There's other booths to buy drinks outside though as well, so you shouldn't have to wait too long. The view is nice, I suppose, as far as views go. You're really high up and can see buildings in the distance. But come on, it's downtown LA. It ain't pretty. Downtown LA is probably the ugliest downtown skyline in the country. But if you like being up high and breathing in that smoggy air, go for it!We didn't make it upstairs for dancing, so I can't comment on that. But from what I could see, seemed like a good time. All in all, clean and swanky.	1
I am 2x World Miss Fitness America PRO and I love having Body Food Kitchen on my corner! When I vacation, go to fitness competitions, etc, BFK makes my life a while lot easier! I no longer have to travel with my good and worry about it going bad! They vaccuum seal everything and it is super fresh! The tastes are amazing! I highly recommend BFK to anyone! Whether you are traveling, competing or just going on vacation, have them worry about your food! It keeps you on track and their customer service is amazing!	1
When I'm in LA and am craving Thai, I rarely venture out of Thai Town, but I made an exception for my friend's birthday and came here with a large group instead. Because there are so many good Thai places in almost every neighborhood, I probably won't drive out of the way to come here, but it'll be a top option if I'm in the area.Consistently good food recommendations:1) Pad Thai2) Pad See Ew3) Beef Satay4) Thai BBQ Chicken5) Fried RiceYou can't go wrong with any of these.Service:Could be improved. Once they bring out your food, the servers just disappear. If you need anything such as refills, you'll have to flag someone down because they won't check on you to see if you need anything.Parking:Very small lot, so it'll most likely be full. You'll most likely have to park somewhere on the street or the surrounding neighborhoods.	1
I just left The Wood a few hours ago and had to share. The servers were very friendly the food (I had the Nutella and banana Brioche french toast) was excellent. My friend had the Omelet Your Way and she was also very satisfied with her meal. Everything was fresh, the coffee was delicious. I look forward to trying more dishes from their menu. On a side note, it also seems like a cool little spot to chill with some friends in the large outside patio and have a beer.	1
I don't really write many reviews, but Wow! Kokio Chicken serves so many varieties of really tasty chicken. This place is way better than KFC across the street... LOL... and better than Kyochon. If you haven't tried it yet, stop by and you will know what I mean. Bon appetite!	1
Fish Tacos are an experience go for them. Absolutely delicious. Service and atmosphere was incredible!	1
I&#39;ve been coming here since I was 7 now I&#39;m 22. The apple pan is legit! The prices are kinda expensive $7 bucks for a burger but its BOMB!	1
One of the best pizza I have ever had. Loved it. Great ppl	1
I have a bad first experience here but because of the owners hard work and kindness ill forgive them	1
This place while cool looking is terrrrrrible.. I went there and had a bad experience. The menu, while impressive is too daunting. Most people want simple and to the point. My real complaint is when I got the food. I had ordered something simple for my four year old and what did I get? two pieces of toast and cheese for a whopping $7. Now I know this is Miami but come on. This is my two cents. I&#39;d never come back here again and won&#39;t. Hope this helps people.	0
Last time I came here the food was really fastThe presentation of the food was great but this time around I brought my friend over here telling him that is such great place it was super crowded there is no where to sit our food literally took 20 minutes the presentation of the food look like crap my friend he got the lumberjack breakfast the potatoes were super oily the pancakes taste like they came out of the box the toast was burnt the only good from his side was the eggs and for me I got the Panini turkey avocado with a side salad. The Side salad is great as usual but the only thing that was terrible on my presentation with the Panini itself The bread kept falling apart and it was a little burnt. This time around I was very disappointed.	0
This is one of our favorite restaurants.  The food is always excellent.  Service is great and a wonderful atmosphere.	0
What a treat and it is so nice to get away from the hustle and bustle of the high rise casinos. The accordion player comes to your table and sings a song about the city that you are from.  A classic.  Oh,  free wine to.	1
Unfriendly service. All dishes we ordered was just ok. A small bowl of rice cost ~$7. One of the most expensive bowl of rice I have even seen.	0
Came in for a sandwich to-go. I got the artichoke sandwich which was a bit heavy on the ricotta and weak on the artichoke. It was also pre-made which was a bit of a disappointment. I hate having to pay 11 bucks for a sandwich I probably could have made as good or better at home.Space looks really cool. If I lived close by I would probably stop in here to grab coffee, take a work meeting, just hang out. Solid you're looking for your basic bakery.	0
The original pantry, historical, landmark, open 24 hours, waiters are fast here,they really embodied the good era, nice bow tie! Abundance of food! Keep that coffee comin' ....and yes.....CASH ONLY! just like the good old days right???	1
Terrible phone reception. Hangs up without a good bye, RUDE.	0
My boyfriend and I stopped in since we stay around the corner, and we used their Yelp deal -- $10 for $20. The menu is well-priced. We ordered the chicken and cheese enchiladas, chicken and cheese quesadilla, some fish tacos, and one of each tostada (shrimp &amp; ceviche). We enjoyed everything but the enchiladas; my boyfriend says it might be the sauce, but we also came in around closing so this may play a part. They&#39;re very friendly; if i&#39;m in the mood for some quick Mexican food I&#39;ll probably head here since it&#39;s in walking distance.	1
I've been going here off and on for the past few years about twice a month (more in the summer time), and have always had a great experience. The waiter/Barteners staff are friendly and professional. And the Food and great and the view is to die for :)	1
Something I'd never thought I'd say about this pizza vs. Chicago pizza - it's better. WAY better.	0
I came here for the first time for brunch today and it was amazing! From the friendly and prompt service to the fantastic menu, I knew I was in the right place. I got the breakfast pizza and my friend got fried chicken and gravy and both were delicious!! I cannnot wait to bring my husband and also try dinner. Yum!!! Great bar or seated atmosphere, great for a date night or a group of friends watching the ball game. Fun.	1
Service here was horrible. One of the waitresses had a bad attitude with my group. She kept trying to rush us to order and was getting a little too impatient when it came to closing time. They even closed earlier than the closing time, so some customers were turned away from service. So the waitress was practically kicking people out when it came to closing time because she really didn't want to be there I guess. The food was mediocre. My ramen noodles weren't even mixed. It was still in a packaged form like the cook just dumped the pack of noodles in the bowl with the soup. They also don't do takeout.	0
Waited an hour for five tacos. Once they gave me my to go order I realized they had left one off and made one of the others different than listed on the menu.<br><br>When I mentioned that they forgot a taco they said &#34;what do you want?&#34; I don&#39;t know, maybe what I ordered.<br><br>If you have time to waste their tacos are okay.	0
Food was amazing. Service equally so. Power went out and the staff handled it incredibly well. Cannot say enough good things.	1
The best sul long tang in K-Town!!! However can not give 5 stars because the service is sub par.	1
Restaurant is tiny and cramped. We ordered a couple of appetizers. The Coconut Prawns were beautifully presented but not very good. Lots of batter. The Toasted Sesame Wraps were excellent. Main courses were average. Doubt we'll be back as there are so many other options.	0
After hearing rave reviews about their ramen, I finally made my way there. As soon as I got comfortable at the counter, I spotted a baby cockroach strolling towards me. With discretion I told a dude that carried an air of management. All was well after that. <br><br>The service was polite and the ramen was flavorful. Then I got the bill... No complimentary bill, no discounts... Nada. Rather than freak out and alarm the other customers that a filthy disease carrying roach was in the confines of this food serving restaurants, I did the right thing.<br><br>The manager guy wasn&#39;t around and I didn&#39;t want to screw over the waitresses. I paid in full with a healthy tip. But this is my honest review. That place needs to be shut down for a few days and treated.	0
Suzanne Hansen, the executive chef, is simply the best chef in Whistler. Enough said	0
This is a great new addition to the River North area. SideDoor may have a slightly trendy atmosphere (the actual side door entrance, the modern yet rustic decor, etc.), but it really delivers in terms of great service and quality. I went here on a Tuesday evening and enjoyed the mac and cheese (soooooooo cheesy and delightful!) and a tall glass of Not Your Father&#39;s Root Beer (words cannot express how amazing that craft brew is...OMG). Our server was very attentive, and multiple people came over to our cozy table to ask how we were enjoying ourselves. <br><br>The only negative was the music. It was all Top 40 and was playing very loudly. It really didn&#39;t match the atmosphere of the place. Other than that, it was a great experience. I&#39;ll definitely go back.	1
been coming to this corn guy for a good couple of years. great service friendly and might i add best corn in los angeles.	1
I LOVED my visit here!	1
This place was very underwhelming. First of all, the parking around the place is terrible. I don&#39;t mind walking, but I had to park all the way around the corner. It was nice walking past all of the nice homes though. Anyway, back to the restaurant. <br>We were seated really quickly on a busy Friday during lunch-time, which was nice considering how crowded the place looked when we walked up. We were seated in a small table in the back, where we were constantly accosted by flies throughout our entire meal. I am not exaggerating when I say that we didn&#39;t have a minute where we weren&#39;t swatting away flies from our drinks, food, and ourselves. I killed 2 flies with my napkin, which did little to remedy the problem.<br>The service was nothing special. We asked for water, and they brought a bottle to our table. Turns out they accidentally brought us organic sparkling water (organic water?!?!), which, luckily, the waiter said he wouldn&#39;t charge us for. <br>My girlfriend ordered the &#34;not your mother&#39;s&#34; grilled cheese and a vegan whole grain salad. The sandwich was very very salty, as was the salad. I would hardly call the sandwich a grilled cheese. More like a panini with extremely dry bread, and a salty tepenade spread. She barely hate 3 bites of the sandwich, and hardly any of the salad.<br>I ordered the Felafel Burger and onion rings. The burger was actually pretty good, except for the bitter hummus spread on the bun. The tatziki was watery and bland, but at least the pesto spread was good. The onion rings tasted like they came from a frozen bag.<br>All in all, the overall experience was nothing special, the food was overpriced and underwhelming, the service was mediocre, and the flies were disgusting and annoying. I doubt that I will ever eat at Toast again.	0
Let me just say that this place USED TO be pretty GOOD.<br><br>Not anymore.<br><br>I have been coming year at least once every 2-4 weeks for years. In just the last 3 months or so, this place has changed a lot.<br><br>(1) NO MORE BANCHAN (side dishes) - Now you get a small bowl of ramen (terrible), spicy rice cakes, and little soft tacos (the &#34;meat&#34; is just gristle). Instead of actual banchan, you get to fill up on this crap.<br><br>(2) NO MORE GALBI. Yes, they got rid of the un-marinated galbi. You can still get marinated galbi - but guess what? It is NOT galbi. It&#39;s skirt steak (or something cheaper) with galbi marinade. It tastes like you&#39;re chewing on leather. *sigh*<br><br>No wonder you can&#39;t get un-marinated galbi anymore. You can&#39;t disguise another kind of meat with that one.<br><br>Someone clearly decided to make sweeping changes and cheap out on the customers.<br><br>Yeah, I&#39;m never coming back here. It&#39;s just too sad. :(	0
Had great food and a great experience here. Thanks!	1
The food is excellent! However the service is painfully slow incredibly painful.	0
We dreamed of this place.<br>Mostly because of the view.<br>Pray it stays not lame.<br><br>We know there are kinks.<br>Like music, service, and food.<br>Can they match the view?	1
So I had been meaning to try Canter's forever and ever now. I was up at a school near the school taking an exam for work and i finished about 1:30 in the afternoon. After one circle around the block I got lucky and found a parking spot open. I ordered the matzo ball soup for starter and a pastrami sandwich on rye. The soup was very tasty. the matzo was good and the broth was tasty. Their homemade pickles were delicious. The pastrami came out and it was very thinly cut and absolutely delicious. It was packed full of flavor. The rye bread was soft and delicious. It comes out with no mayo/mustard on it. I am not a fan of mustard so they brought me a side of mayo at my request to put on the bread. This was the PERFECT pastrami sandwich. I cannot wait to go back and get another one!!	1
Overpriced terrible pizza. Arrived over and hour after ordering with no explanation or appology	0
2.5, so disappointed... We made reservation at 10pm, and we didn't get seated until 25 minutes after our reservations. Place was very loud, it was like I was eating in a nightclub.The food was "ehh". Nothing special, I had better French food elsewhere. There wasn't anything special or "wow" about this place. I was so DISAPPOINTED in their planchette de charcuterie (meat platter). The selection of meat was a lot, but did it taste good? NO! It was a sat little platter of meat. We also go the cheese platter with it, and boy, that was even sadder! Cheese was not good and it did not have a good selection or good mixes. We also got the mussels, the bouillabaisse, and their ratatouille... the best was the ratatouille, and everything else was okay. It didn't have the really great flavors, but it wasn't bad. My mom cooks better French food and she's not even trying to! So sad... this place is disappointing, especially for the price.Our waitress was non-existence as well. But the bust boys were awesome, they should become waiters and replace that waitress. She sucked but the bust boys rules. Don't waste your money. There are FAR better French places in LA. I would never come back or recommend this place.	0
K-town... oh you&#39;re so funnnnyyy. You don&#39;t even try to make places &#34;American&#34; friendly. If I wasn&#39;t with my Korean friend, I would have never found this place! The restaurant sign in the plaza is in Korean!! How are non-Koreans supposed to know where this restaurant is located? But I guess it&#39;s a common thing in K-town. *shrugs*<br><br>I ordered the spicy bulgogi and it was really good. I loved the spicy marinade and the beef was cooked perfectly. I love thier kimchi side dish! I prefer kimchi to not be too sour, and that&#39;s just the way it was here. Yummmm!	1
I found this place when out on a bike ride..I had recently moved to Miami from NY/NJ and have always loved my cheesesteaks.. When you see 10 miami police cruisers parked all over the place you know its either a murder scene or a damn good place to eat...Well I was right this place has the best cheese steaks...The prices are less then 6 bucks with all the toppings and the people there are great...I would get a large sandwich with a large cafe con leche for less then 10 bucks with tip...	1
Just went for the first time tonight and can&#39;t wait to come back! <br><br>The menu is amazing from start to finish and everyone working there literally could not be nicer.<br><br>I got the leg of lamb which is some of the best lamb I have ever had. It was perfectly cooked and the quality meat was outstanding. My girlfriend had the vegetarian option which was a potato, egg and goat cheese dish and was raving about it.<br><br>Can&#39;t say enough great things about this place and we are already planning our next trip back.	1
Pretty good food just average huge portions!! worth going maybe during the weekdays for breakfast meetings except weekends are horrid very busy and patrons allow kids to scream and yell when politely asked them to stop the child so we could enjoy our meal they said f... You. Management was at the next booth and I&#39;m sure heard it all as she was looking at me said nothing ..... I sure didn&#39;t appreciate the cussing in front if my kids.... Probably wouldn&#39;t go back unless was the only option ..... Management should have more control of the chaos	0
Okay this place has a nice atmosphere (despite the construction zone currently outside of it), but nothing else. The food is "home-made", and it really tastes bad in my opinion. The tortilla chips taste like they have a cube of butter in each chip. And I didn't care for a lot of other items on the menu. You can tell that there's no seasoned chefs in the kitchen. The drinks are also pretty bad, mine was way too strong, tried my friends and I didn't care for it either. Overall, I don't think they really know what they're doing with the food. Okay if you just want to stop by for a beer and watch the game. Not for me.	0
Best veal porterhouse. And there shrimp n grits version excellent	1
Five stars alone for the colada! Best colada I&#39;ve Ever had. I shared a pan con lechon and a club sandwich. They were both fantastic. The tres lech was not made in house and i was a little hesitant but we tried it anyway, totally amazing!!. I would most definitely go there again. Food was great and so were the prices.	1
Great food, good ambience.The only problem that I had it's that when I arrived home, I checked my bill and they include 18% gratuity. I purchase the Bloomspot for Farmerbrown, at the voucher specifies "If you use this certificate with a service where you would normally tip, always tip on the full amount of the pre-discounted bill (the certificate value + the amount spent with the merchant). "That's what I did", I tip (cash tip) on top of the 18% gratuty. "Not cool".	0
Finally tried Kingdom of Dumpling to see what the hype was all about. We ordered my fave "little dragon buns" xiu long bao, potstickers, pork dumplings, corn/pork dumplings, and my other fave, beef chow fun. The beef chow fun was mediocre. Now onto the dumplings, I LOVE XLB, the anticipation was killing me just waiting for it to come out! When it finally came to the table, I was expecting to bite into it and have hot soup gushing out and having a block party with the taste buds in my mouth... But no, a disappointment! The XLB barely had any soup inside and the taste of all the dumplings we ordered were quite bland. I guess its back to usual place in SSF!	0
Amazing burgers! and healthy options too. Turkey burger, mushroom burger. Serving was superb. Ashleigh was super friendly and attentive. She makes the best margaritas.	1
The greatest in my humble opinion!	1
The food gets 5 stars -- the server recommended the Shepherd's Pie and it was tasty. I had to take half of it home because it was such a large serving.My fiancee had the Pesto Chicken Wrap and it was good as well.	0
Decent, overall good food. Not AMAZING but it&#39;s a neighborhood gem, for sure. And Palms can always use more places to visit. I&#39;m sure this will improve with time. Dinner on a Saturday night was consistently busy but not overwhelming, although they just opened so we&#39;ll see in the coming months. <br><br>Baby tuscan kale salad - large portion so I was happy I ordered small<br><br>Polenta - the first time I have ever ordered something with seafood. It was fine but I let my husband eat the last half.<br><br>Sausage - a bit too salty so make sure you eat a biteful with the beans. It cuts the flavor down. <br><br>Pappardelle - Good but a little bland. Reminded me of beef stroganoff. They were also out of the rabbit that night so it was a shortrib meat.<br><br>Damilano wine - Tasty but nothing to write home about.	1
We had dinner reservations here and were accommodated for quickly and sat at a beautiful table on the patio. My girlfriends and I ordered a bunch of things and shared. Mussels, baked brie, and brussel sprouts were all delicious. I'd expect more, to be honest, from a place like this also because the food is kind of pricey, but I'd definitely give the food an overall B+. The main courses were a little lacking in my opinion.Drinks were pricey but strong. Most cocktails were $11-$13 and everything we tried was a little on the sweeter side. Our server was great every time he checked on us, but that was far and few between.My favorite part is when we moved upstairs to the upper level. Chill place to drink and chat with people...Music was eclectic to say the least. They were playing strange remixes of old songs - definitely just background noise but nothing you can dance to if that's what your looking to do.All in all, it was a good experience. I'd come back here again just to chill for sure but would maybe eat at a better restaurant in the area.	1
Since discovering Potbelly, I will not go anywhere else for a quick sub-style sandwich. They just do everything better then Subway or Quiznos, and by a large margin.	0
KICKED OUT! I recently had brunch there and had the worst service Ive ever had in Seattle. Not one thing we asked for extra ( ice for our water sweeter for our tea condiments for our food) did I not have to get up and get myself. Finally when the food arrived cold and I had to get up yet again and track down my server (who was eating her hot food in the back) paying no attention to me standing outside the kitchen door which I had to open up to get the fork out of her mouth. For this I get accused of barging in the kitchen and asked to leave. My advice dont complain about the lack of service or cold food just sit there quietly and let them take the money out of your pocket. DONT BOTHER THE SERVER WHILE THEIR EATING	0
This was our first time eating at Luna Blu.  We already have plans to go back.  Service was top notch.	0
Incredibly disappointing. My girlfriend and I arrived here to meet some friends before a show at Ruby Skye, and we had such a bad experience that I actually created a Yelp account to warn others.The service was atrocious. We saw our server so rarely that we were forced to go the bar for several drinks. And on that note - I have been bartending for four years, but apparently bartenders in SF are above saying "thank you" for a 25% tip on two shots. It's not that hard, guys.My girlfriend ordered a "Greyhound" - which I clarified with the server was a "vodka and grapefruit" - that after some absurd amount of time came back as a vodka/cranberry. When our dinner eventually arrived, we were uncertain if we perhaps ordered off the kids' menu. The appetizer chicken quesadilla came as three tiny tortillas with some chicken and cheese haphazardly thrown in the middle. My girlfriend ordered off the salad menu, but it looked more like a side salad at Denny's than a light dinner. And the guacamole that everyone seems to rave about? Save a few bucks and mash an avocado with some tomato, because that's what it tasted like. Certainly not spicy as we requested, and we threw our own salsa in to add the lacking taste. When the bill arrived for $140, I was flabberghasted. For whatever reason, the restaurant charged us for Grey Goose, despite no one at our table requesting that particular vodka for our four vodka-based drinks. The management reversed the charge when I inquired about it, but I wouldn't be shocked if they told the servers to just resort to more expensive call drinks.Inevitably, we should have eaten at the Jack in the Box next door. More food, better service, and a hundred bucks cheaper.	0
I was in Miami for Ultra and needed a quick bite somewhere in the downtown area. This place hit the spot: cheap and tasty sandwiches for on-the-go ravers.	1
I went here once after visiting Garfield Park Conservatory and I was pleasantly surprised. I expected a casual cafe, which it is... But the food has a very gourmet twist! My family and I loved the Southern spin on the menu and now we go here whenever they visit. Prices are reasonable, food is seasonal, and they have plenty of vegetarian options too.	1
food is great, it&#39;s a little loud inside	1
I love the sullungtang, kimchi, and kakdoogi here. It's a clear broth, not as milky as your usual sullungtang. I actually prefer it this way. Mmm so hearty and satisfying.	1
The food was decent. But I left feeling extremely disappointed.<br><br>Hickory Burger -- $7.10 + $.50 for cheese for a burger that is about the same size as an IN-N-OUT 1 patty burger, if not smaller, which is unfortunate considering the price. Toasted bun was slightly stale, but the burger was good. 3.5, maybe 4 star flavor if the bun had been fresh.<br><br>French fries -- (slightly less than $3). They were fried from frozen; you can tell from the texture of the center. Barely worth eating. 2.5 star flavor.<br><br>Apple pie a la mode -- $6 for a slice + $2 for ice cream.<br>Good flavor, not amazing. You can buy a whole apple pie at Trader Joe&#39;s for this price for similar quality pie. 4 star flavor.<br><br>Ambiance -- this place is a greasy spoon type of establishment. You sit at a counter which surrounds a viewable cooking area on three sides. Great type of set-up for a quick bite but not a place you want to linger. 3 stars.<br><br>Overall value -- 1 stars. Food was nearly twice as expensive as it should have been. I got two burgers, two fries, and an apple pie slice a la mode (for two people) for $31 before tip. It felt like a rip-off.<br><br>At IN-N-OUT I would have been just as happy with the burger, happier with the french fries, and happy with a milkshake per person. The same meal would have been about $15 and arguably would have been a better experience.<br><br>For the record, I&#39;m going to do you yelpers a favor and list the 5* burgers in the LA area:<br><br>Slater&#39;s 50/50 -- Huntington beach, Santa Ana, Pasadena -- huge customizable burgers 50% beef/50% bacon patty. ~$10<br><br>The York -- Highland Park -- juiciest burger, Chipotle Harissa is genius addition. ~$13<br><br>Laurel Tavern -- Studio City -- get the juicy burger with barbecue sauce and blue cheese. Melts in your mouth. ~$13<br><br>See! I don&#39;t mind paying for 5* quality...but when I&#39;m paying for an establishment&#39;s outdated pedigree instead of flavor, I am disappointed. Word to the wise Apple Pan -- you should start accepting credit cards, especially with your prices.<br><br>I will probably never come back to the Apple Pan, unless their prices go down or their portion sizes go up and they start making fresh French fries.	0
We went here to celebrate a birthday.  I have been here before but for brunch, which is fantastic, but never for dinner. The food was very good. I got the Thursday frenzy, sirloin with gorgonzola. Everything was great. My stepmother who never likes,anything ate everything and loved it! We will definitely be returning. The staff was a little stretched thin so it was hard to get the waitress' attention for drink refills or anything that we needed.  It looked like they had an unexpected large party that may have overwhelmed them though.	1
If this rating were based on food alone, the Marshal would rate a high 3 or low 4. My diminished assessment of it is a result of its poor service, particularly from the hostess. The narrow space was a problem as well - we received more than a few elbows and purses to the backs of our heads by people walking by.<br><br>Now, about the hostess. I&#39;ll list a few adjectives: aloof, confused, inflexible, snarky. We dined at the Marshal pre-theater with a party of six. Twenty minutes before we arrived, the hostess called us to ask us the time of our reservation. Strange, but... OK. Then when my wife and I showed up we wanted to sit in the restaurant to wait for the rest of our party since it was bitterly cold outside. We walked in, saw our table and asked the hostess if we could sit to wait. The hostess stated in an almost robotic tone that restaurant policy did not allow her to seat us until our entire party arrived. Somewhat bemused, I asked if she had any suggestions for what we could do in the meantime. She kind of trailed off and awkwardly backed toward the kitchen. We bundled up and stood on the sidewalk, as standing near the narrow entryway would have impeded other customers. Once the rest of our party arrived we were seated. My wife politely told the hostess we had theater tickets, to which she responded with &#34;Yeah, I know,&#34; in a tone somewhere between indifference and disdain. Bottom line Marshal: your hostess needs immediate remedial training - she&#39;s a detriment to the establishment.	0
Great burger. Its usually packed, but thats part of the charm. Some of the friendliest restaurant service I've ever had. Seating is "first come first serve" and uses the "honor system". Quick seating turnover typically. This is one of the best burgers in LA - never disappoints. **Cash only. There is a Wells Fargo ATM/Branch right next door.	1
I came here yesterday because the hg told me it was her new fave shabu place. I usually go to Khan Shabu cuz it&#39;s the best and after last night.... it still remains the best.<br><br>First of all... they don&#39;t even explain to us on how to order and what comes with what. We almost ordered like 4 servings of food until I stopped and asked the waiter if this was too much food for 2 people to order. He then said... &#34;oh yes, it&#39;s a lot of food.&#34; wtf.... so I got the regular beef shabu and he got the shabu+spring rolls and an order of the spicy BBQ pork. <br><br>When the food came the veggie plate had no tofu, no fishcakes, no dumplings, no fucking enoki mushrooms.... literally only came with 2 pieces of cabbage and 2 pieces of greenlettuce and 2 small sticks of mushrooms. SRSLY WTF. So I called the waitress and she said that this was it and if we wanted more veggie, we will have to order it separately. WHAT? So basically the $18.99 beef shabu actually goes up to $25.99 because of the extra veggies we have to order since they pretty much give you nothing. So I asked her if it was going to come out with all the other things like dumpling, tofu, fishcakes.. etc. and she said said yes. So when it came out I realized there was no tofu and asked her why and she says that tofu does not come with the extra veggies we ordered for the shabu and that we will have to order it separately. <br><br>At this point, I literally wanted to throw the hot pot of boiling shabu at her face. I ordered the tofu and when it came out..... the tofu was the extra super soft tofu they use for soonduboo and on top of that they gave it to me uncut. I asked the waitress what they wanted me to do with this huge ass piece of tofu and she just looks at me with this dumbass face like she doesn&#39;t know what to do. Super annoyed, I just said fuck it and quickly finish my food and left.<br><br>DO NOT EAT HERE PEOPLE. WORST SERVICE. WORST SHABU EVER.<br>TOTALLY RUINED MY APPETITE. NOT WORTH IT.<br>GO TO KHAN SHABU INSTEAD!!	0
Some of the best burgers I've ever had. The burgers are small but that doesn't take away from the quality, although they are a bit on the pricey side. The truffle burger is amazing. If you're craving a quality burger and don't want to settle for a fast food place, Umami burger is definitely worth it.	1
I had an awesome time at Testo! I met with my friends, who live in the area, and they have just recently discovered this neighborhood&#39;s gem. We stayed there for a long time, talking and enjoying our night out, and even long after our delicious meals were gone, we did not feel pressured to leave or to order more. <br>The staff spoiled us rotten, being very friendly and attentive, but also giving us a lot of space.<br>The decor of the place is simple yet charming and so soothing and cozy that we just did not want to leave! Now food...super yummy! I had squash raviolis that were so soft and fluffy, just melting in my mouth, hmm...I want more just writing about it. Too bad that I live in Queens but I will be back for sure. <br>Summarizing: this place is a MUST! Outrageously good food, great atmosphere, super friendly staff and reasonable prices, should I say more? Highly recommended!	1
My husband and I gave 4 stars because of the meat, it was magnificent: juicy, tender and cooked to perfection. But, if you&#39;re looking for a complete restaurant experience that includes nice presentation, good sides, (although the german potatoes are different and very good) or nice ambience, this might not be for you. Probably, you&#39;ll be better off at smith &amp; wollensky.	1
I was fortunate to receive an invite to BLT Steak, the newest restaurant at Bally&#39;s Las Vegas. Our table for four wasn&#39;t quite ready for us, so we grabbed a drink at the bar. Our bartender happily suggested one of their signature cocktails with basil and watermelon. It was mighty refreshing, slightly sweet and herbaceaous. I enjoyed it, but the overall crowd pleaser was their take on the Long Island Iced Tea. It was refreshing, with some bite. Just what I like in a cocktail. In addition to cocktails, they offer top shelf liquors, bottled beers and varied selection of wine. Prices range $8-$15 for most libations.<br><br>Once seated we were given an amuse bouche of pate and jelly, with toasts. It was a lovely presentation, but a bit rich. Later came the popovers that just might have made BLT famous. These monsters are light and airy, simply perfect with a pat of butter and pinch of salt. The egginess couldn&#39;t help but remind our group of Yorkshire pudding.<br><br>The menu offers seafood and poultry, but you must try the steaks ($20-$60). They are aged (mostly dry), broiled and finished with herb butter. We had the filet and bone in NY strip. Both had beautiful crust and were cooked to a perfect medium rare. More juicy and tender than you might expect. They offer sauces to accompany the steaks for a few bucks, but we agreed we liked the steaks on their own best. Though, the horseradish that came with the three mustards was the favorite. We also had the 2 pound lobster which had a lovely presentation, great flavor, it was delicate and tender; the trouble was there wasn&#39;t enough meat to it.<br><br>The sides ($10-$13) were heavy on taters, you could have them six different ways. We opted to try a variety, we shared onion rings, potato skins, hen of the woods mushroom, and caramelized brussels sprouts. We found the sides, with the exception of the brussels sprouts - now, those were delicious - to be the weakest link of the meal. We thought they were too basic, we expected a twist that would elevate your traditional onion ring or potato skin, but nope they fell flat.<br><br>Dessert ($10) was really decadent! Portions are large and good for sharing. We had the crepe souffle, warm chocolate tart, peanut butter chocolate mousse and mini doughnuts. The passion fruit sauce on the crepe would&#39;ve been better served as a drizzle. It was cloying and overpowering. The tart was more of a lava cake, but the pistachio ice cream was wonderful. The PB and chocolate mousse was rich and heavenly, though, I didn&#39;t care for the banana ice cream pairing. The doughnuts were light and similar to churros and I really enjoyed the coffee ice cream.<br><br>Overall, it was a great meal. The staff, while warm and welcoming, still have kinks to work out, but in time they should be operating a well run ship. Rumor has it, the Sterling Brunch will return.	1
Loved the margarita, the nachos, the al pastor tacos, and the pork belly carnitas. Sure it's a bit pricey for Mexican, but you're on the west side, so it's to be expected.Everything was super flavorful and they were very careful to take my gluten intolerance into consideration. The only thing lacking flavor wise was the tres leches, but once you've had Portos....no one can really compare.	1
we made our reservation on OpenTable the restaurant confirmed it earlier in the day when we arrived those seated within 15 minutes of our arrival we ordered drinks and when my wife complained about her margarita the waitress gave us an attitude the service was poor and half of our party received cold food	0
I&#39;ve never been treated worse by a manager of a restaurant. The service was horrible and we had to beg for silverware. When we asked to speak to the owner, the manager spoke FOR her. I wonder if she is aware. Will NEVER return and I&#39;m sure to pass the word to all downtown dwellers.<br><br>They take reservations for 6 or more but charge an automatic 20% tip for parties of 5 or more. Be sure your service will be lacking or non-existant with the auto tip, understaffed restaurant, and demeaning manager who has obviously never worked in any other restaurant before.	0
The reason I'm giving them 1 star is because there is no 0 star. Terrible service!!! Worst in LA	0
I went visit Da Claudio last week with my fiance and and old coworker. We had a cheesplate at the bar while enjoying a perfectly made Old Fasion followed by one of their signature drinks. Bartenders are really professional and helpful, It reminded my of those mixiologist bars. Strong menu and cozy place. I wish you the best of luck! We will be back.	1
After a gorgeous day in Manhattan Beach, were hungry. Not much was open in BH on Labor Day evening so I remembered that I wanted to come here and give it a shot. Much to my delight, it was open.I liked the vibe and the staff was friendly upon arrival. The pesto they serve with the complimentary bread was great. I had the turkey and brie panini with a side salad. Everything was fresh, flavorful and satisfying. It hit the spot and I was a happy camper.I tried the mini red velvet cupcake and cheesecake brownie. Steve had the coconut macaroon. The desserts weren't really worth it in my opinion and could've passed. The macaroon was basically a pyramid heap of dry coconut with a hard chocolate bottom. Perhpas they are better when fresh, but this was a fail.Based on my meal, I would definitely go back.	1
Great	1
Friendly, competent bartenders slinging a pretty inventive cocktail menu.<br><br>We went during the day...I can&#39;t imagine this place at night (the bartender said it was &#34;unbearable&#34;). A beautiful space with a wonderful view. On the first really warm day in LA in a while we lazed around and nibbled on cake and day drank like bosses.<br><br>A really nice place.	1
What they do well, they do really well. What they don't do well, they charge an unreasonable amount for. Good luck getting a table on a weekend. I come here a lot because it's open 24 hours, but I don't usually venture out and try menu items outside of the the tried and true because every time I do that, I am disappointed. Though sometimes my faithful favorites get changed around and that is uncool.The Mac Daddy and Cheese balls are the thing to get here. They are advertised as "belly bombs," and what a fitting name. They are so rich that at my hungriest, I have only every eaten four, and they give you ten or twelve of them. I've never finished a whole plate between two people. But they are delicious mac n cheese balls with a hint of jalapeno to offset the cheese a bit, with panko breading which is the way to go, and deep fried. Oh heaven. Heart attack on a plate.Their breakfasts are also really good, especially their french toast, labeled Mr Frenchy, or Bearded Mr Frenchy if you want it rolled in cornflakes before cooked (which I highly recommend). Their eggs are usually well cooked, and their bacon is thick cut, which is the only way to go, as far as I'm concerned. Their Thai Cobb salad used to be really great. It comes as a square on your plate, and it is a finely chopped spinach cobb salad with a Thai slant (peanuts and fried wonton pieces maybe), and it used to be lightly tossed in dressing. Now, though, it comes with a Thousand Island moat which is WAY too much dressing, thankyouverymuch, and they've added some ingredient which I couldn't pinpoint, but it felt like a slight excess. Their sandwiches are fine, though I wouldn't recommend them. They are nothing special, and often on the dry side. The above dishes are the best on the menu, and I have yet to find something that is better than what I can already identify as being great.And of course, for Fred's you can't avoid mentioning the atmosphere. If you aren't a super ridiculous hipster, you will look out of place to yourself, but try not to care and you'll be fine. I like going during warm weather so I can sit outside so I don't have to yell over the music that they crank up to excessively loud volumes late at night, and so that I don't have to take in the judgmental glances from the people who go to there to see and be seen. I would give this place a 3.5 stars, but you can't do half denominations and I am feeling generous, so a 4 it is. Congrats, Fred. Congrats.	1
They just reopened a few days ago what was used to be takara ramen. The place definitely looks so much better than before. I did like takara ramen better than now. <br>The service back then was fast and great. I wet there yesterday and it was chaotic. Granted they just opened so that was not a big deal. <br>The menu changed drastically. Bigger menu for sure. No more pork miso which was my favorite. I enjoyed the smaller menu better.	1
Amazing view of LA, day or night! Great place to hang out with friends. Drinks range from $9-$13. Parking lot next door is only $5 flat rate after 4 pm on Saturday and Sunday.	1
If you are a seafood lover, this is the place for you. There seafood are fresh and tasty. And the prices are around $20-$30 a person. Although it's not all you can eat but the food are enough for you. I think the best value are having 5-6 people and order the C set. Not a chef? Don't worry!! They actually have people come around and cook for you. The girl that helped me was Sammi and she's very nice. She gave me an extra steam egg for my daughter. You must come here if you like fresh BBQ seafood!	1
Margarita's were so bad we had to send them back. The second drink I got was supposed to be a gin and tonic, but they poured a vodka tonic. Again it was kinda of nasty, but I drank it anyways. I like the patio seating, it was lovely sitting out there on a sunny Sunday afternoon.	0
I made a reservation for 2 for 7pm. I showed up, could not believe the attitude the wannabe actress hostess gave us. I was shocked. She seated us all the way in the back in the deli section (no one was there and the deli counter was making loud strange noises) - after I made a reservation ! I asked to be moved back into the main restaurant or outside. Hostess refused.Waitress was friendly but the food was over-priced and disgusting. Dirty dishes, dirty lipstick stained cups. Saw a few roaches in the back. I was stunned. This place is supposed to be hipster-ville. When I went back up to the front (it seemed they had forgotton us in the back) the waitress was talking and complaining about her patrons. How unprofessional. Never going back. Not clean. Food was served cold (speghetti and meatballs).	0
Good quality meat for the price. It&#39;s not an AYCE but honestly, wouldn&#39;t you want to pay a little extra for better quality and service? I hate those AYCE places where they basically throw the meat at you and you try to cook as quickly as possible to get the next batch. The servers take their time and cook the meat for you, cut out the fats. I like how they give lettuce and wraps for the meat here and they&#39;re not stingy with the veggies	1
If you had a Corean Grandmother and she made you comfort food when you weren&#39;t feeling well, this is what it would be like.	1
I had to be different and ordered from the breakfast menu - lo and behold i wasn't impressed. When I received the dish, huevos con chorizo kind of looks like vomit on a plate. Evenly divided up in fourths there's refried beans, rice, huevos/chorizo and bright green lettuce all accompanied by a side of tortillas. The entire dish was taste-less. NO amount of hot sauce could revive this dish. One thing i did like was the salsa, you must try it. The consistency is much different than the normal pico de gallo type salsas. Next time, if there's a next time, i'll try the burritos like everyone raves about. Boy did i order the wrong thing.	0
We went for brunch, it was our third visit. The food was very good as always, the food temp, especially the cheese blintz's could be warmer. We noticed in the past that the food tends to be just warm here, not hot.  On this visit after placing our order and waiting for maybe fifteen minutes we asked if they had their bread-danish basket available. Within a couple of minutes of asking for it we were given a basket full of wonderful pastry with an apology for not having brought it out before. I had to ask for a refill on my coffee and it took maybe 00-05 minutes before I got the refill. All in all, we really enjoy going here and will go again. It's a bit pricey but worth it for the historic atmosphere and good food (Just serve it a little hotter please).	0
Imagine a tall elegant cocktail glass filled with dark frozen cubes of tea. A lovely server prepares the beverage at your table. First a small decanter of sweet, freshly brewed black tea, then a bit of flavored cream all gently poured to be the absolute best Thai iced tea you have ever tasted.<br><br>Like the illusive flower, Sunnyside&#39;s new hybrid thai restaurant Blu Orchid is more than special. Each dish creation and presentation is creatively thought out. The highly skilled chef pours lots of love and attention into every plate. Bring many of your friends to this gem, it is the ultimate place to share a bit of everything the eclectic menu has to offer. AND the brunch menu is fantastic.<br><br>As for appetizer assortment suggestions: order the edamame, ceviche, a plate of calamari and some ribs. Oh, the ribs! I am dedicated to spreading the word about how addictive the tamarind mole baby back ribs are. The thinly mocha glazed meat truly melts off the bone. I hear there is a growing list of rib devotees.<br><br>The main dishes vary in flavor complexity depending on your level of food adventure. The traditional pad thai and fried rice great standbys and the hanger steak or duck go above and beyond the typical-hybrid-asian fusion dishes out there in the NYC foodisphere.<br><br>The proverbial cherry topper for the meal is the complimentary dessert. A subtle savory, homemade tapioca with sweet corn and warmed coconut milk	1
The murals! &nbsp;The murals!	0
went last saturday to the wood, enticed by a friend's description of specialty chocolate drinks... none of which are still available, although they are still listed on the website's menu... they have one left, the el parador chocolate, but it's $2.00 to add a shot of espresso, so i ordered the mocha, which was as weak in chocolate flavor, more like nestle's quik, with no apparent trace of espresso... the place is poorly laid out to accomodate people ordering at the counter, the bustling servers and the diners who are seated wasy too closely to both... the yellow plates are an unfortunate choice that make the food look as unappetizing as the service, which while not entirely rude, was not service at all... the chicken curry sandwich was nice and light due to yogurt instead of mayo... it was also a bit dry, due to yogurt instead of mayo... i've seen better croissants and pastries at the local donut shop... my sister indicated the "o" brand ketchup from von's, apparently they got busted for serving heinz...	0
The first time I came to Friedman&#39;s I had a wonderful experience, but this past Sunday was pretty sad and pathetic on my part for waiting an hour and a half to sit down. We were first offered a seat at the communal table, which if you have ever gone inside is a debacle in its self since all the people waiting to seat are standing, watching, and breathing all over you and your food. The manager said if you want to sit there I can ask the people to stand back. I kindly declined and said we would wait for a table. Another 15 minutes later, we did not get a table, instead we had to settle for two seats at the bar, which was just as bad as the communal table.<br><br>When we went to order they were out of the fried green tomatoes which was pretty disappointing because I was excited to impress my boyfriend with a delicious brunch, his favorite meal of the day, with one of his favorite foods- green tomatoes! <br><br>Not only was my omelette bland, but they charged me an additional $2 to switch out the whole wheat toast for what looked like a mini biscuit. On top of it, the barista was super busy and yet the manager felt the need to order himself a specialty hot chocolate. Even more annoying than that, the manager was insisting on seating some people he knew who were waiting a measly 30 minutes ahead of 6 other parties that were waiting over an hour already. <br><br>I get that the food is good, but honestly for a wait that long, service mediocre, and snobby managers, likely I won&#39;t return of recommend this place.	0
This place is definitely not your average restaurant. They are very big on presentation! The present their food & drinks in a very fun and appealing way. I ordered the Buddhalicious drink. It comes with an infused Popsicle. It's delicious. For my main dish I ordered the Lured by Salmon, and sure it enough my food came with a giant salmon attached to the plate! The salmon itself was tenderly cooked and it was just fantastic. And lastly, for dessert I ordered the Marie Antoinette Cotton Candy and let me tell you, it is a sight to see. Even if you're not a cotton candy fan you have to order it just to see it from up close. But the cotton candy head comes with mini cakes, berries, and whipped cream all of which were yummy! The ONLY thing I would suggest for them to improve on is space. There's not much space between tables for people to pass through. And with huge presentations like the ones they have they NEED the extra space. Other than that I liked the place a lot and I'll remember it for the unique experience :)	1
Enjoyed my meal and nice atmosphere, although could get uncomfortable if crowded however this restaurant is still worth a visit.	1
Ok ok...in my country we call humbow siopao. I was ending my tour through the market and couldn't resist buying a pork humbow and a pork BBQ skewee (ok ok it's called pork BBQ on a stick there). Yummy. Great for a dinner on the run; I had another meeting that evening.	1
we love going there for happy hour and just ordering a ton of appetizers for dinner. the spicy tuna handrolls are soo good also the salmon handrolls... the gyoza are good too. the blue drink is not bad for a cheap happy hour drink.	1
I found this place on Yelp...4 out of 5 stars usually means it&#39;s good. I ordered the Chicken Stew which was very basic. It was very mediocre. <br><br>I also tried the grilled chicken which was very basic. It was juicy but it only tasted like it had been charred, not much flavor. <br><br>Won&#39;t return.	0
Fish tacos were mushy (the fish), salad overdressed, condiments meh. Prices not great - sandwiches 12-15 dollars. Service was decent.	0
A special thanks to the Queen Anne resident who saw us wandering around in search of a good meal and who pointed us toward Crow. Outstanding food and service good prices a real neighborhood vibe.	1
Move over colonel...them Koreans sure know their fried chicken.I've been coming here for awhile to get my fix of garlic soy fried goodness. Wraps are good, I like their fries because they're potato wedges not no sissy shoe string bs, straight up man fries.Dining inside has a few problems. Parking inside tends to fill up quick due to the neighboring restaurant in the same structure. I'd park at the meters on 6th st to avoid valet if possible.Service is decent since they have buttons but the food takes awhile sometimes. I usually overlook this because i feel it goes to show the preparation that's involved with my feast and makes me crave it more if anything. They offer delivery if you dont want any of these issues, which is why I gave them 4 stars, because of the quality and service. Colonel don't be bringing chicken to my house that's all i'm saying...And always get garlic soy! The best.	1
I went in here expecting good food but I was blown away with the artistry of tastes and form in their food. I could write a long review of the delicious and unusual layered elements in just one salad I ordered, but it might not even be on the menu very long. The chef only uses what is available at its prime. Suffice it to say that Chef Morningstar has a very experienced and creative palate and he uses good judgement in putting a spectrum of flavors together. I have never had anything that did not exceed expectations. It is a great place to go for new ingredients prepared in highly effective delicious ways.And to be in the museum complex makes the whole atmosphere and event feel filled with creative electricity and excitement. Come here to have a meal where you leave inspired.Did I mention the chef has a nearby garden on the grounds for herbs, hard to find vegetables, and other things that might find their way onto your dish?The restaurant is easy to find ... right behind LA's famous street light art installation on Wilshire Blvd. Parking is abundant in the underground parking garage with the amazing elevator, or by valet or merely on this interesting street section of Museum Row.One warning: the place is not huge so come at off-peak times to avoid crowds.	1
I&#39;ve been here several times and I&#39;m always satisfied.	1
Pizza was super yummy. We ordered the thin crust pizza with pepperoni. The sauce is delicious. And probably my favorite part. With the pepperoni it was not too greasy. The cheese was perfectly cooked. They didn&#39;t add too much like some places do which was great. I would recommend. We will probably order pizza here more often now.	1
Foods is whatever - average bar food. How does a restaraunt attract the crowd it does, though? I can't blame Brixton for the people who frequent their establishment, but they must cater to them in some way to keep the same crowd coming back.The crowd is...douchebag central (at least on a Saturday night)! Chics with the worst combination of insecurity, overcompensating by sending judging glares at every woman who walks by that threatens them. Insecure guys desperately looking for validation with one-night stands. I don't mean to sound bitter, people, and I hope a second visit proves me wrong. If you're looking for quality food, enjoyable conversation and relaxing ambiance, you would probably have a better experience at Extreme Pizza...	0
I have never in years of fine dining sent back a dish, until the Presidio Social Club. The pork with hash was awful, let me repeat... awful. In addition, the service was terrible and the waiter explained how he would have to bring all of our food and appetizers at once because he was also working a large party and apparently could not balance his time even though he is a professional waiter. For all they hype this new restaurant has gotten, I was truly disappointed to say the least.	0
My new favorite place with my new favorite drink: milk punch. Cool vibe. Yummy desserts. Staff is accommodating and attentive. <br><br>I haven&#39;t actually eaten a proper meal here, so this is based off multiple visits for drinks and dessert. (smores = bangin)	1
Being a jew and from New York, I&#39;m always excited to try a new Jewish deli. I was a bit skeptical in the beginning since it&#39;s hard to beat the NY delis, and it turns out my skepticism was not unwarranted. I did not like Canter&#39;s. The pickles were so bitter I could hardly eat it, and my sandwich had so much cream cheese on it, I could not even taste the smoked salmon. To top it off, just these two things cost me over $20!<br><br>Also, what kind of Jewish deli serves Penne pasta?<br><br>Update: according to my friend Josh, Canter&#39;s &#34;deserves another star because of the stained glass ceiling and it&#39;s history.&#34; There you go.	0
I live around the corner and this is a great after-work happy hour spot. The view is great, the drinks are always done right and the staff are the nicest I've met. The food needs work, but I usually tell friends 3 out of 4 ain't bad. The other alternatives to this spot are The Churchill (in the Orlando Hotel) down the street or El Carmen. El Carmen doesn't have an outdoor patio and is dark, whereas the Churchill has outdoor seating but can get loud and crowded. I would say between these three spots I live in a great neighborhood - they definitely balance each other out.	1
We popped into this cozy little french place last night with sort of high hopes. The best part about it were the drinks and the live band playing French songs that took us right back to Paris. Other than that it was not very good. The wine selection was good and reasonably priced, We ordered the cheese $14, 3 measily slivers of cheese but it came with some nice candied almonds and a few grape halves. Mediocre. I was starving and ordered the bouillabaise $25. The broth was thicker than I&#39;ve had in the past but it tasted okay. However there was barely enough fish to fill me up, And I couldn&#39;t help but feel they weren&#39;t as fresh as could be. I was still hungry after that. My husband ordered calves liver. He said it was barely okay and thought he might not feel well today.... Profiteroles for dessert were edible. I would not return	0
Move this place a bit closer to the Blue Line and Metra Irving Park station and I bet this place would be crowded. <br><br>Hankering for something hot and sweet, Ihad a craving for a nice hot crepe from this freezing weather. Cafe latte, while a good size, was too bitter for my taste, it&#39;s piping hot which I liked. Nutella crepe is better than the one I&#39;ve had in Andersonville and the outdoor market in Wicker Park. I really enjoyed the nutella filling with the chocolate syrup combo. While I prefer a very thin crepe that is almost crispy, this one hits the spot.	1
service was great! however, out of our group of 5, nobody was happy with the food, and we all left unsatisfied and feeling like the food was very bland and underwhelming. good view, but won't likely return.	0
Just. Mouth watering. I really love the meat.	1
Perch is one of the best restaurants in LA. Location is spectacular, the food is delish-4 stars based of wait only. Its so small they only give a handful of reservations out. To go in without one is a death sentence meaning you will die before you get a table. People mostly go to be seen and don't really relish the food.	1
i fucking love your bread.	1
Raw burger	0
We decided to come to buddy's restaurant after the great experience I had at his bakery in NJ. The food is pretty good; I ordered the meatball appetizer, and it was good! For entrees, we ordered shrimp scampi and chicken parm, both were quite good. It was really cute restaurant located in the Venetian, and suitable for a good, not-so fancy meal in the heart of Las Vegas.	1
Above average late night food, but the late night menu is absurd, especially when they change their times of when the kitchen changes over far too often. <br>Don&#39;t know why they like losing mine and so many others business by switching to the limited menu, guess they don&#39;t like making money?	0
First of all, if you&#39;re going to order anything from here, don&#39;t bother even looking at the menu because they will ALWAYS mess it up. Whether it&#39;s one ingredient in the sandwhich or all the ingredients or even the wrong item, it&#39;s always an awesome surprise and an amazing LET DOWN. The sizes of the wraps and sandwhiches are inconsistent (like the ingredients) and the baguettes and bread are sometimes stale. I just ate a sandwich that tasted like the bread was baked a week ago. The delivery takes centuries to arrive and when it finally does and you&#39;re excited and super hungry, your food is soggy, cold and most likely not what you ordered. Upset about the order? Not to fret, you can call in and be met with unnecessary attitude and excuses. What&#39;s not to love?! When that didn&#39;t solve any problems, I tried writing to them directly and they&#39;re obviously too busy and care too little for their customers to bother writing back. This place was good a couple years ago where they actually cared about the quality of the food and the service they were providing for their patrons.	0
Not only the best take-out in Verona, but Jordandal Cookhouse has the best food in Verona. I'd eat here before any sit-down restaurant in town.	1
Pros: Food wise, this is a potentially Michelin star restaurant. That&#39;s how good the food is. PERIOD. Cute decor and ambiance. Outdoor space looks promising but still in progress as of this writing. <br><br>Cons: THIS IS NOT A $$ RESTAURANT. It tastes like a Michelin starred restaurant so it is priced like one. You can&#39;t reasonably expect to walk out of this place without $80 per person without alcohol feeling somewhat full. <br><br>Overall: Adventurous and innovative restaurant in an area that is up and coming. Do give it a try, but be prepared to spend!	1
Even though this is conveniently located near my house, I honestly wouldn&#39;t mind traveling a little farther to get better food and better service. <br><br>Came here the other night with my friend &amp; father. It&#39;s a typical Asian fusion though the name is very Thai, serving Thai - Viet - Japanese. <br><br>For a &#34;Thai&#34; restaurant, I&#39;m actually VERY surprised that they do not sell Tiger Tear salad here. It&#39;s the best. I asked anyhow, they knew exactly what it was and said they could accommodate me. Great! <br>Much to my chagrin, it was a small salad, BARELY any lettuce AND they charged me a ridiculous $10 for it. No bueno. <br><br>Food here overall was just alright. Even though I asked for spicy, food didn&#39;t have the kick I wanted nor some of my favorite flavors that Thai food is known for. I loved loved this restaurant back on the US1 side, this Kendall experience was lackluster. <br><br>Sidenote: this review is NOT based off of one dining experience.	0
I wish places like this was closer to me. I've only been here once, but i loved the coffee and whatever pastry/dessert i got really hit the spot. I'll return one day if i'm in the area and need a place to hangout for a while. Very cute and comfortable environment.	1
This is probably the only place that has extremely spicy chicken. It was my first time eating bool dak (spicy chicken). When I took the first bite, I almost gave up and was ready to order another plate that wouldn't be spicy but I had to endure the pain just to prove that I can handle it (I know, I'm such a dude). Anyway, it wasn't comfortable eating the spicy chicken throughout the whole meal but I finished the plate.It is pretty expensive for a chicken place but they give you a lot in portion. You can share one plate with another person and be super full. The service was excellent.	1
My hubs and I had reservations here and went for dineLA over the weekend. It was really busy, and we watched our waiter run inside and outside the restaurant to cover his tables. He did the best job that he could. The staff overall were very accommodating and friendly. A guy who bussed the tables felt bad when we were sitting there waiting and gave us bread with chimichurri to tide us over. He said he was sorry and that we must be starving. I was extremely thankful for that. All in all, I blame management, they were clearly not ready for this and should have planned it better with more staff, or should have stepped in and started taking orders or something. Between our actual reservation time and the time we got our appetizers we had waited an hour. Our entire dinner from walk-in to signing the check took about 2 hours or so. However, the food is the reason why they get a low rating. There were a lot of hits and misses and for the value, I have experienced better. Here's the breakdown:Appetizers:Goat cheese, apples and bread fondue: tasty liked the apple and cheese combo, together both flavors contrasted but were interesting. Poke with wonton chips: tasty, typical Poke, would order again.Main:Pork stuffed with mushrooms & gruyere cheese, green beans and mash.: pork was tender and very good, the sides were not. The beans were undercooked and the mash was ok.Jerk chicken, butternut squash, brussel sprouts with brown sage butter: The Jerk chicken's description should be changed to blackened chicken. It tasted exactly like Friday's blackened chicken or something like that. It was not at all like Jerk, but it was tender. Squash was good. Brussel sprouts were tender and very good, by far the best sprouts I have ever had. Oh and they had macadamia nuts on the chicken, oddly it was very good and was the best tasting thing on the plate. Dessert:Fried apple pies with ice cream: very good. It had caramel all over the pies and the ice cream was a nice touch.S'mores: This was pretty good, however I did not care for the crackers. I was hoping for traditional cinnamon-butter flavor but it did not have that. The marshmallows were toasted perfectly. The chocolate was indeed bitter but not sweet, which I like, however the hubs wanted milk chocolate or sweeter. We decided to try this because it was on "The Best Thing I Ever Ate" on Food Network. It was a hit and miss. We each liked parts of the ensemble, but not all.	0
Had we not taken advantage of their happy hour prices (until 7PM, I believe), I wouldn't pay full price for their menu items. This place wasn't very memorable, and I don't see myself coming back when there are so many other restaurants to sample in the area.	0
I only had drinks here so I can't comment on the food but the four stars are simply for the good vibe and service from the staff...so refreshing!	1
I have no idea what everyones talking about with this restaurant... I did not enjoy this microwaved food.	0
I had terrible food poisoning from the tonkatsu ramen. I'm now too scared to go back.	0
I've driven past this place for 4 years and never ventured in. It might be because of all those ladies that lunch who frequent the restaurant next door. Who knows...but my friend and I came here for a (rushed) lunch last weekend.I ordered a great scone with rasberry jam to take home and tried to eat my chicken salad on my lap on the park bench outside. Not so successful. Between dropping my (plastic) fork on the ground and feeling pressured by the time on my watch I decided I really wanted one of the delicious sandwiches instead of this leafy bowl of eating difficulty. So, I think La Brea Bakery and I will meet again another day so we can get to know each other better!A consolation was that I ate the scone sat at the comfort of my desk with a cup of tea a day or two later...Not totally fresh, but it was darn good anyway!The folks here are friendly and if you're looking for something they'll hold it for you before it sells out - and it does sell out here. PS - If you're going to the bakery you should be able to park in the lot for free.	1
We recently dined at DT and had an annoying experience. My friend and I wanted to grab quick drinks and food before a night out. After placing our inital order and waiting for drinks, the server responded by saying they ran out of our food selections and the bartender could not make the drink requested, that was on their drinks menu! This didnt happen, once, or twice, or three times. Every drink requested wasnt able to be made. I felt our server was sincere and apologetic, but come on, how do you run out of food and not know how to make house drinks! We will not be returning.	0
Hidden little place right behind don fernando&#39;s on bird road. Decided to get some take out from this place. Honey chicken hit the spot, was really good and fresh! fried rice was okay..nothing too special. I definitely think this place has some good potential and from all the great yelp reviews, ill come by sometime again to try some other things off their menu.	1
Calle Ocho is a great place if you are looking for a place for a big group (the dining room is huge with sectioned-off group areas)- especially if your group cares more about drinks and atmosphere than exceptionally flavorful or high-quality food.<br><br>The drinks and the appetizers are fantastic. I&#39;ve tried the tropical mango sangria and the Spanish Harlem sangria. Both were delicious. My boyfriend had the classic mojito. We started with the snapper ceviche, which was wonderful. It was very light, fresh and flavorful, and came surrounded by a garnish of buttery popcorn. I was surprised by how well the salty and crunchy popcorn went with the spicy and citrusy smoothness of the fish. <br><br>The actual meal was nothing special. I had the Costa Rican taco appetizer as a meal and my boyfriend had the tilapia. The order of tacos was massive- it came with a dozen or so mini corn tortillas and steak, chicken, shrimp and a plate of salsa, guac, lettuce and sour cream- definitely a good appetizer for a group. The chicken was good, but the shrimp had a strange texture and the steak was really tough. <br><br>My boyfriend&#39;s plantain-crusted tilapia was what surprised us the most. It came thickly breaded and fried, which we didn&#39;t expect from the menu description. I think we were expected a lightly coated grilled or pan fried fish with vegetables and a flavorful tropical sauce. The fish looked and tasted like it should have been served with fries in a newspaper cone. <br><br>To sum up: great drinks and appetizers, mediocre and expensive (around $25) entrees. I would come back, but probably just to sit at the bar and have drinks and apps.	0
Came for lunch and am pretty sure it&#39;ll become a regular occurrence. Although they have the &#34;NOW OPEN&#34; sign still hanging outside, I&#39;ve heard from quite a few people to come try this place out and now I know why.<br><br>The menu was far too lengthy to be able to decide, so my boyfriend and I decided sharing was the way to go. I got the Napa Valley and he got the Clydesdale. Both of us opted for the side salad (their dressing is delicious!!), though the chips I saw on some other tables&#39; plates looked yummy, too!<br><br>Great ambiance. I was impressed with their modern mixed with steampunk decor. Especially loved the pipe light fixture along the wall and grass sprouts on each table. Everything was extremely clean and organized.<br><br>They offer pour-your-own drinks for teas and lemonades, as well as ice (pebble style!) and water. No outdoor seating which is a bit of a bummer for the area, but all in all a great lunch spot.	1
My rating is not based on their food but on my visit to their establishment a couple of weeks ago. My 3 friends and I, ironically, found Lola&#39;s on Yelp. We read the great reviews and decided to have dinner there. We noticed it was stated &#34;reservations preferred&#34;. Keyword, &#34;preferred&#34;, not &#34;required&#34;. Walking up to the entry, we observed at least 3 empty tables on the patio and a couple inside and knew we would be able to have dinner. We walked in just after 6:00pm and were greeted by a gentleman/host at the entry and told him 4 for dinner. He looked at his seating computer and said, &#34;We&#39;re unable to seat you. We have reservations for 7:00pm that will fill all our seating. Let me look again...no, we can&#39;t do it. Maybe you guys can fit in at the bar. No, that&#39;s full now&#34;.<br><br>WOW!!! The 4 of us were flabbergasted! We couldn&#39;t believe with an hour before the &#34;supposed&#34; reservations, that we couldn&#39;t be seated and served. And who&#39;s to say that every reservations would have been on time or there could have been a cancellation. Well, we&#39;ll never know...about any of the above or the food.<br>Great job on customer service Lola	0
So I've been coming here for a while and have been in love with the decor and growth of the menu:) I haven't been in a while so today came in with some friends and have noticed how quick I got my yummy eggs and almond chai along with a flakey, delicious croissant. Would've appreciated some more smiles from customers and hardworking employees, although I'll give the benefit of the doubt. The sliced avo for 3 bucks has churned my stomach... Why?! 3 bucks would buy me 2full avos anywhere else. But all and all its a great place with a tastey chai and food.	1
Wow, I really don&#39;t get how this place has been getting 4 stars. This place is most definitely a 5 star place. The food here is absolutely delicious and not to mention the service. This was our first time visiting this place, we were on way to ocha the restaurant next door which we did regularly and then we saw this new place and we decided to give it a try, Anyways its always nice to try new things. So we went in and david who was the person who help us was very friendly and showed us the how to with the dishes. Then when I tried the food I was like OMG this is so good, the flavor and the smell, simply delicious. This is from now on my families new regular restaurant. <br>Everything was great!!!!<br>oh and I forgot to mention that david is Korean but he speaks Spanish very fluently. <br><br>Thank you for your great food and for that great service keep it up!!!<br>Welcome to LA :) <br><br>I will absolutely invite all my family and friends to this new place \\<br>blessings :)	1
Great ambience and great food - but not cheap.  Service was excellent for the most part but there were two issues: wait staff removed a glass of wine that was not empty (drink was replaced after notification), and one menu had cheaper prices than another - not an oversight I would expect at this level of restaurant.	1
I was in Chicago for a conference, and a good friend who&#39;s a Chicago native highly recommended The Gage. The Pamplemousse grapefruit drink was delicious and refreshing. I ordered the poutine and was seriously disappointed; the French fries were stale and soggy, and the dish was over-salted to the point that I had to send it back after 2 bites. I also ordered the poached lobster, which was good, but the accompanying bisque was also over-salted and couldn&#39;t be consumed in its entirety. <br><br>I came in with 2 colleagues, neither of whom ordered any food or drink because of religious dietary restrictions. The Gage doesn&#39;t have anything for people who need to avoid alcohol, pork, shellfish, or dishes that don&#39;t combine meat and dairy. The noise level in the restaurant was deafening, even in the back dining area, away from the bar. The terrible noise made one of my colleagues cranky and hostile, and he&#39;s normally a nice guy. Our server, a friendly brunette, took the inedible poutine off the bill, and I felt bad that my friends didn&#39;t order anything, so I ended up tipping her 50%.<br><br>Less salt, please!	0
Good quality of meats and service<br>Call them a head and order for pick up<br>They do deliver too<br>Sounds pretty nice :)	1
The prices were WAY to high for the quality of food.<br><br>We had the ribs, and at first sight we were SO happy. The looked big, juicy and extra saucy like we like them.<br><br>At the first bite, there was 5% meat, 45% bone and 50% sauce. The actual rib meat was DRY... And the sauce was all I chewed up. More like barbecue soup on a bone.<br><br>Yuck. Our waitress was pretty dumb and had one of those dumb girl laughs.. Pretty annoying. She got half our order wrong the first time, as she was too busy worrying about the &#34;hot guys&#34; sitting next to our table.<br><br>Never again. Thanks but no thanks Earls.	0
Not too many choices and very small portions. Not a lot of protein choices, especially with the pasta, most plates are vegan.	0
Way over-rated for VERY average dumplings, thus the 1-star otherwise, it's probably a 2.5 star. Honestly, if it wasn't for the sauce this is no better than the frozen dumpling you can get from the supermarket.Seriously, I don't see what the rave is about here. Maybe people just thinks any hole in the wall place is a great because it is always packed. This place is packed because the place is small, not because it has good food. DON"T BE FOOLED"Go to San Tung or heck any other average dumpling place and you should be able to find equal or better dumpling than this here. And I am not being sarcastic!	0
After I had the bavarian cream I haven't been able to convince myself to try another. My little treat was not as chewy the last time I went but perhaps it was the last of a batch? This fluke won't stop me from returning for more!	1
Went here for brunch for a friend&#39;s Birthday and it was DELICIOUS! <br><br>I had been here for dinner before and the ambiance was great, but highly recommend for brunch. <br><br>Everything we had was divine! I had the biscuits and gravy and it was SO savory and flavorful. The biscuits were flaky and buttery. The gravy was meaty, salty and had a hint if spice. A perfect fried egg on top to round off the dish. Yum! <br><br>The Bday girl had the pork belly hash and it was awesome! Equally as flavorful and savory as my dish. We also shared the lemon blueberry ricotta pancakes and they were fluffy and not too sweet. Perfect complement to our savory dishes. <br><br>Overall an underrated brunch spot that I will likely frequent more often. <br><br>They didn&#39;t have Sangria like I has hoped, but maybe that will be back soon. Bloody Mary and mimosas were great!	1
This place is horrible! The outrageous and rude remarks on their website should have been a red flag, but I decided to try them out anyways.	0
I find this place has fallen in quality and cleanliness. Dumplings were cold and noodles soup was super salty. Blech! Customers dumping all the leftover soup into an open bucket next to the customers who are still eating. It&#39;s disgusting.	0
If this is the best mexican in madison, then I'll not be eating much mexican. It is authentic, but there were bones in my chicken taco, which was somewhat bland besides that. I also ordered a torta and a pork taco. The pork taco had flavor, but the torta was light on meat and felt like a mouthful of bread. I didn't finish my meal, which is very unusual for me.	0
Best Booze in the Mile. Too bad they don&#39;t stay open late.......<br><br>Stark has all the sweet fancy cocktails and top shelf spirits, love to come here and try their seasonal/ rotation drinks. <br><br>Also sit at the bar, chat with the fellas, they&#39;re way cooler than the oversize chairs.	1
Answers the question "Where do all of the hipsters go to get a burger in Hollywood?" I was clearly the least-cool person in the joint, which I felt right away upon stepping through the doors (and yes, any place with that many hipsters classifies as a "joint")I stood in a line by the bar for literally 5 minutes before I realized that I was not standing in a line at all. It seemed that all of the staff at Umami were embarrassed to have someone so obviously not a hipster in their midst, because I did not get a friendly greeting. I had to be the one to break the ice.Eventually I surmised that I would have to be the one to approach them in order to get recognized. Junior high dances came to mind, with the amount of awkwardness that this venture entailed. I ordered the Truffle Burger. Not because I wanted to, but it was more of an act to become accepted by the staff and patrons. The burger was awesome- one of the best tasting burgers I've ever had, I might add. Although, it came out a bit bloody for my liking. But I guess that's how hipsters do it.People that know me know that I am a huge sucker for a good sweet potato fry. Umami had a moderately decent one. I know what you're thinking, "how dare a common serf such as yourself scoff at Umami's sweet potato fries". Well I did- they just weren't up to my standards. Maybe if they weren't so preoccupied with appearances, they could have whipped up a better fry.The "Umami Ketchup" tasted a lot like "Heinz Ketchup"- okay, maybe a bit different.My biggest complaint was the pricing- if you weren't getting a "combo", then it ended up being a tad overpriced. Speaking of their combo's- this was hands-down the coolest part of Umami: a hipster nod to the McDonald's value meal, they offered a few combo's that included a burger, a side (fries or onion rings) and an adult beverage. Kudos to you, Umami.Bottom line is that I would go here again. Next time, I would wear sunglasses at night, for sure, maybe a pair of skinny jeans, and definitely a pretentious smile....or whatever the hell it is that hipsters wear....	1
Wow... this is the first time in a LOOOOOONNNNNNNNNG time I have been truly happy with my experience at a new restaurant. We walked in and were greeted by two hostesses. They were unable to seat us but explained that we could have full service sitting at the bar AND that there were open seats. So we did that. <br><br>Our bartender immediately brought us drink menus and water. He asked if we were going to dine with him and brought food menus when we said yes. I liked a lot of things on their drink menu but I completely recommend you getting (if you dont like sweet drinks, like me!) is the Winter G&amp;T. It is AMAZING! Its Beefeaters Gin marinated clove, cinnamon, star anise, mixed with a little tonic and topped with a orange twist for a citric aromatic touch! To top it off the drink come in a LARGE stemmed, goblet wine glass so you don&#39;t have to get your hands cold or wet every time you pick it up. PEEERRRFECT! <br><br>The next best part was that I, as a vegetarian, I had plenty of options to pic from for dinner. I ended up ordering the Beets and the Wheatberries. What supprised me the most was the Wheatberries dish. It was not what I expected at all but in a fabulous way. The light sauce had a touch of rich butter and the proportion of chickpeas, wheatberries and yogurt was good. The only thing I thought there could have been more of was the squash. It was used more as a garnish than a part of the dish. Either way... I eat it all up! <br><br>My meat eating husband had the Potted Salmon and the Bolognese. He was taken back at how good the salmon was that he finished every last drop. He said it was very unique in its smokey but fresh flavor; that with every bite he wanted more! <br><br>Our bartender provided great service with full water glasses, fresh drinks and everything else. The best part... 5 drinks, 2 apps and 2 main dishes didnt break the bank! Love it!!! <br><br>As I am writing this we have already booked a reservation to go next weekend with some friends. That&#39;s how much we loved our experiance. GO! NOW! FOR ANY MEAL AND ENJOY!	1
I love this place! I've been here twice. Once a while back, and once today for lunch. I had the Hickory Burger both times. I think the special sauce they put on it is great. Also, cheese does cost 50 cents extra but it's worth the splurge because they use a slice of Tillamook instead of American and you can tell the difference. I also had fries (nothing above average but good) and a piece of apple pie (YUM!). Next time I might order one of the ham sandwiches, we'll see.As for the seating situation, it is a little tough. My brother and I had no problem grabbing a seat at 12:30pm today, but there are probably only about 20-30 seats so if you plan to visit during a prime time you may want to plan to get it to-go. Other then that the service is very fast!	1
I was extremely hungry and craving pizza ... then I went on seamless and Nick&#39;s Pizza Bar caught my eye. Did a quick google search and pictures looked good, so I ordered! Simple square pie with extra sauce (I&#39;m a sauce fanatic).<br><br>So I ordered just shy of 11pm, and never got the confirmation email from seamless. Called, learnt that they actually closed at 10:30 and their times on seamless weren&#39;t accurate! Money got refunded, and I decided to go out and eat ramen... but 30 minutes later my doorman calls and tells me I have a food delivery! Not sure what happened, but anyhow I got home an hour later completely stuffed from the ramen and just left the pizza out on the counter in the box ... next day, I reheated it (skillet+steam method) and it was one of the best, thin-crust, crispiest pizza&#39;s I&#39;ve ever had. Cheese and sauce ratio was perfect and it wasn&#39;t too heavy. Perfection!<br><br>There isn&#39;t any good neighbourhood pizza that delivers - Nick&#39;s is so great that it should be a destination pizza joint. I was craving Marta&#39;s thin crust pizza, but now that Nick&#39;s is in town I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be visiting Marta anytime soon... and dare I say amazing service for delivering my pizza at 12am in the morning? Thank you Nick&#39;s.	1
Arrived early for reservation and staff was overwhelmed by line at door.  Once we decided to sit at bar we were quickly served.  Butternut squash gnocchi was amazing as well as eggplant appetizer.  Limited wine list but excellent choices.  I overall experience great and we'll certainly come again.	1
We'd been here once before. Waited the obligatory hour to be seated, suffered through so-so service, and left wondering what all the fuss was about. So driving by Sunday morning we noticed there wasn't a wait and decided to give the place another try.We chose poorly. Same uninspired food and blah coffee.If you're looking for somewhere to eat in the area you have three other very good choices. IMO Joan's, Simplethings or Little Next Door are superior alternatives.	0
Just called, the Chinese lady was rude. with attitude on the phone like she was doing me a favor. Had to cancel the order, and besides she wanted to charge me for hot sauce. haha good luck on the business	0
After working out at the gym (im a personal trainer) i decided to stop by to check out tower since it was on the drive home, and it would be a good stop to get my protein intake and enjoy a nice burger and onion rings since it was my day off from my strict diet.the burger was good, but it definitely was not worth the price.its my first time eating there and i was disappointed. $16 for a western burger, coleslaw, and onion rings, which by the way i only got 6 freaking rings!!!! what the hell man!!!! i would not go back there again, for people that don't care about spending 16 dollars for something thats going to leave you hungry then its a perfect fit. other places like Sliders offers better burgers and more quantity for your buck.Dont be tricked by the reviews of this place.	0
The menu on OpenTable was nothing like the one at the restaurant. We were expecting a much higher class of restaurant. This was more like a &quot;poolside&quot; restaurant serving burgers. The Cuban burger we had was good but nothing special. My husband sent back the very dry Mongolian beef dish he ordered and just ate half my burger. (they are very large) The appetizers we had, crab cakes and egg rolls were like what you could have bought in the frozen section of your local store. Really very disappointed. We won't go back.	0
Cute cafe with tasty, freshly made sandwiches. Miam is just what Wynwood needs, a reasonably priced sandwich shop. We went for their grand opening and tried their Adult Grilled Cheese on Zak the Baker bread. Good sandwich but that guys Zak&#39;s crust is a little too hard for my taste. The Roast Beef and the Miam club were awesome too but on the same bread. When I come back I will order the grilled cheese and I will cut off the crusts!	1
we stumbled upon this GEM and Michael Mina and staff have created a beautiful version of an intimate Parisian cafe. Michael Mina and staff have a sppecial knack for putting their own twist to tradition and have pulled it off to perfection at Bardot. This is an experience not to be missed!	1
My order of enjoyment Happy Hour Lunch then Dinner. Fried gnocchi with truffle creme sauce is crazy. Their burger is great (wife says best in Seattle). Drinks are off the hook especially the spicy pear kamikaze and the provincial goose (lavender martini).	1
Just went here for a quick drink one night (I mostly hand to use the bathroom) and somehow ended up staying and drinking at the bar the rest of the night. The service was great - our bartender Jackson is amazing! Super nice and was recommending really good beers. The whole vibe here is really cool too, the inside is kind of dark old time industrial wine cellar (too many words? whatever).I'm planning to go back and try the food next time. I eyed the huge ass tots they had there. Damn some huge ass tots looking delicious.	1
Something's not right when you feel like you've been robbed. The only thing hot, was the cashier. Would have been better off serving me a bowl of salt. I'm going to in and out to forget the whole experience.	0
After spending some time in Williamsburg, I have realized that being a hip hipster and providing customer service doesn&#39;t necessarily go hand in hand. And that affects my ratings. <br><br>Cubana Social appears to be relaxed and cool. The environment is casual, they have room for both larger groups and it is the kind of place where you can take the kids for lunch without being stressed about it. The menu is varied with local produced and organic food, and it offers vegan and vegetarian alternatives. It seems fairly priced, but the portions aren&#39;t very generous. And when the food isn&#39;t all that tasteful, it doesn&#39;t help that you have the best intentions. The biggest issue though, is the staff. The service is quick enough, but there doesn&#39;t seem to be any effort put into making you feel welcome. Distanced faces, minimal dialogue. <br><br>Light up, people, I won&#39;t tell anyone that you smiled..	0
I&#39;m a big fan of rooftop bars so I might be a bit biased. The view here is pretty nice at night and I enjoy having a drink or two here. I&#39;ve had dinner here once and thought that the food was pretty good but nothing memorable/impressive. I love that there is a live band playing here.	1
This place is probably def a place to visit when you&#39;re in la. A rooftop bar with a nice view of pershing square. <br><br>It&#39;s a lovely place to go to for brunch on sundays and a nice place to stop by when out and about in downtown.	1
We went in to eat and walked out IMMEDIATELY. My friend and I were ordering food for ourselves and a homeless man when the manager cut us off half way and stated &#34;she didn&#39;t care who we were ordering our food for&#34; and she didn&#39;t have time to waste. I&#39;m the owner of a business where I deal with a lot of restaurant owners from the Brickell area, and this was the most TERRIBLE service I&#39;ve ever received. This place should close down. Terrible. I hope she reads this.	0
Do NOT come here. This place is definatly way too overrated. You walk in and get the nice feeling of an old restaurant, you see the kitchen, and you can see their "famous" pies being made. The server was not very polite, did not ask if I wanted anything, just stared at us. We finally got in our orders, then we get our fries within two minutes. They look good, but looks can be decieving. We get our burgers, but once again are disappointed. Got a slice of apple pie and it was very plain. About half an hour later my stomach is growling and gurgling. Overall this place is bland, and for the price paid I expected better. If you want a burger with flavor, and without the overwhelming stomach pains then go to The Counter, or even In n Out.	0
Can&#39;t understand why this place got five stars. Food was fine but price was not worthy than the taste I had. Server was kind but took so long from ordering to get foods on the table. Last, server said that they don&#39;t accept the debit card so we gave another card and again and again. Finally I ask to try my debit card and then it was working and it was fourth card we gave to her. What a nice place have a server who does not know how to swap card haha no more word to say	0
Just a note: +1 star for the awesome Sunday happy hour! 4pm to closing! I also very much enjoyed the outdoor patio seating---loved the lights and the projection of the nba game, a very chill place to drink, eat and hang out.Perhaps too chill, haha. I don't know whether or not it's because our waiter was swamped, but everything seemed to be moving slowly---and he forgot my friend's bacon fried rice (but he comped it) which I thought was a very nice move. I got the tacos, and the wings--wings were reminiscent of the wings at cha cafe--I think that if it had some sort of a sweet and sour sauce, it would have been perfect! Also, the wasabi fries was VERY interesting, the pork tacos were delicious! (I got a fatty piece of pork and that makes me very happy). My boyfriend got the far bar burger---great bun, great medium cooked beef, great onion, great cheese! Very good burger--I took two bites of it hehe. As for drinks, the bf tried the bacon old fashioned, the friends got the regular old fashioned, and I got a taps cream ale? (beer of the day) very smooth beer that I will think about for a while. I'd come here again--but probably after I've exhausted everyplace else, or if I come here for happy hour drinks after dinner. Either way---yum!	1
Sad to say, my experience at Perch was not that great.I came here on a romantic date and was really digging the vibe and the beautiful view from the patio - everything looked really good from the start of the date. However, as the night went on, my boyfriend and I experienced food that was above average served by servers who were way below the bar. Unexpected at a restaurant/bar that presented itself as if it would hold high standards in service!What really irked the most was that our server was so friendly to a Caucasian couple next to us but was icy cold and rude to me and my boyfriend. He even urged them to go checkout the rooftop bar, which he didn't mention once to us. I hate to think that people in L.A. still show racial favoritism, but experiences like this (and others) have proven otherwise.Dear Perch, please train your staff better! Until then, I won't be going back and definitely won't recommend this place to any of my friends!	0
The burger was good, but overall I wasn&#39;t impressed.	0
Great tasting amazing portions for the little price you pay they have a scale on 1-10 on spiceyness and the pad see ew is on point one of my favorites in town now !	1
List is one of those places where you feel a little cooler as a person after visiting because of the ambience of the place. The place just exudes modern style and elegance. The food is a pleasant surprise too, as many stylish restaurants/bars tend to disappoint on substance. The time to come here is during happy hour when all the appetizers are half off and the beer and wine is discounted. I sampled 3 different dishes: green salad with vinaigrette and grilled octopus, grilled Chilean sea bass, and the gnocchi with black truffle cream. The octopus on the salad was tender and meaty with a hint of char to it. The salad was good overall but the vinaigrette was a little tart for my tastes. The Chilean sea bass was perfectly moist and tender. It came with some interesting accompaniments (farro and wilted greens) which helped to balance out the dish. My favorite dish of the three was definitely the black truffle gnocchi. I am not a big gnocchi eater or connoiseur, but the name seemed intriguing. The gnocchi turned out to be the best I have ever had. Pillowy soft, creamy, and almost melt in the mouth. The accompanying truffle cream sauce melded with the gnocchi into one delightful creamy mouthful. I am looking forward to visiting List again, enjoying other delectable plates, and feeling like I am one of the cool kids again.	1
This was the very first place i ate when i moved to LA 4 years ago. I loved it then and I love it now. The food is great (though it's been almost exactly the same stuff for the last four years) Service is super friendly and awesome! I will continue going here for sure!	1
We came here on a recommendation because it was our first date night in a while after finally getting a babysitter and were really excited to be there.  The entire staff was obviously distracted by an event outside and in the side room and their 'regular' customers, that they treated us like we did not matter.  The wait for the main course was 50+ mins.  No manager ever came over, even though he clearly saw us upset.  0 of 2 entrees, ahi tuna, required no cooking, the other came out burnt.  For the $ of the final check, we should have not left hungry, sober, or upset.  Maybe we caught them on a bad night because it did have a nice atmosphere, however we will not be coming back to find out.  A manager visit would have gone a long way.	0
Complete garbage brussel sprouts were not cooked and really heavy on the cooking oil, tiny sausages, gave me potatoes instead of the spatzle I ordered. On top of that they didn&#39;t have any of the gulasch I originally ordered. I have no get loaded is great, but getting drunk is easy, food was extremely disappointing. Do yourself a favor and just go to bludso&#39;s up the street.	0
White peach bellini. That's all I need to hear.	1
Pricey and the burgers were not good. I had the blue cheese burger. It tasted only of blue cheese. <br>My sister had the regular cheese burger and it was so sweet she couldn&#39;t eat it.<br>For the price it has horrible. Will never go there again.	0
Where are 10 stars when you need them? We came here tonight for a night out and wanted to try something new. Wow! What a wonderful, special and an absolutely delicious restaurant! Everything we ordered was fantastic--from the starters to the entrees, and then dessert--prepared perfectly, with balanced flavors and off-the-charts fresh ingredients. Charlotte, our server, was a delight, with just the right amount of attention and knowledge, but not pushy or in your face. The decor is charming and welcoming, with mix and matched furnishings that all work well together. It&#39;s an intimate place, with decent acoustics, so you can actually hear what your dinner companion is saying. Not to be missed!!!!	1
We had a lovely Christmas Eve Dinner.  We were seated timely and enjoyed the Four Course special.   We were not rushed and each course was a treat.   If I could suggest adding something to enhance the experience it would be music.	0
A dope Mom &amp; Pop burger spot. I come here when the office wants some burgers, chicken sandwiches, and fries.<br><br>I really like their fries with the Lawry&#39;s-like seasoning. Their strawberry lemonade is on point though.<br><br>If your order is big, make sure to call it in because they cook to order. I can&#39;t complain cuz the food comes out right.<br><br>Thank you, Fred and the Downhome staff.	1
went there last night for dinner with a friend<br>We were greeted by the owner right when we arrived.<br>the service was very great and the food was awesome, even tho I didnt get to try the lamb t-bone that I was hoping for<br>started off with the wet hound, which was very good and surprisingly strong drink from a restaurant kind of have the mojito taste to it.<br>My favoriate of the night was probably duck egg pasta! I was never a big fan of pasta but so glad we ordered it, the pasta was cooked just right not too saggy, when the dish came out, you can just smell the flavor of the duck fat blend in with the egg pasta, they have the duck skin super crunchie and a little sweet that just adds so much texture and flavor to the duck pasta, I think I can just order that and be satisfied with the dinner!<br>we also ordered the lamb shank since the owner recommended it, it was good, but I wish there was more sauce to the meat.<br>also the steak was prepared just right, a good cut of meat doesnt need too much seasoning, so the steak was just simple and good.<br>we also ordered chilled berkshire pork cheek crostini, the pork was soo tender taste very close to pulled pork, and on a bed of creamy ricotta cheese, simple delicious<br><br>too bad my friend wasnt feeling well toward the end of dinner, so we had to leave without trying the dessert menu, but I will definitely come back and try other dishes and try their dessert menu. Overall, it was an awesome dinner that I haven&#39;t had in a long time :)	1
I can't recommend the Chart House highly enough from the decor (stunning central tropical fish tank) including the bar area, the service, which was attentive yet not overbearing, to the food which was amongst the best we've enjoyed in Las Vegas during this trip. The filet mignon was completely scrummy, tender and cooked perfectly, and the stuffed flounder was exceptional. The decadent lava cake was one of our rare forays into dessert territory but was well worth the extra calories!Definitely give this one a try, you won't be disappointed.	1
I work in this neighborhood and have anxiously awaited the opening of this restaurant for a year. We ventured in during the "soft opening" and I will sadly never go back. The evening began and ended badly mainly due to the loud and obnoxious manager. The very worst part of our experience. He was bombastic, complained to us about another customer and yelled at the bartender. Who I assumed he hired and through her own confession had no bar experiences what-so-ever. She admitted she knew nothing about wine either which besides beer is the only alcohol they serve. He yelled at her when she poured a corked glass of wine and continued berating her throughout the evening. The service was exceptionally slow, even for a soft opening. I ordered a sole appetizer, which arrived raw. There was no mention of the fact it was raw on the menu nor had the bartender said anything about it. The entree plates were so hot, we were repeatedly warned not to touch them but the rabbit dish I had ordered, which came on one of those plates was stone cold. The manager took the plate away when I sent it back and never asked if I wanted anything else. We finished our soup which was delicious, paid our bill and left. The manager came running outside after us to apologize, it was so very strange. The next day, I encountered a client who asked if I had been to Nico. I in turn asked if she had at which point we couldn't believe that we each shared nearly the same experience, only her's was worse! The manager complained about the help directly to them, as the (male) bartender made faces at the manager behind his back. She said it was like a Saturday Night Live show. Slow service, rude manager and under prepared food. I really feel for the staff. What an uncomfortable thing to experience while dining. I will stick with the ever so great Girabaldis for dinner and lunch. Sociale and Spruce too. It's really too bad, not just for the neighborhood but also the owners who seem to be very nice people. Get rid of that manager! It's your only hope.	0
Really reeeaaally great burger. I wouldn't eat here all the time because it's a little bit pricey for me, but the waiters are great and the food is oh so delicious. Definitely worth a try if you're in the area.	1
Second time around. Still pleased. Had The Nuthouse sandwich and yum. Watch out for the Au Jus sauce its got a Kick.	1
I didn't like the first dish I tried, but the second time I ordered chocolate crepes. My order came with three big crepes, full of chocolate and garnished with strawberry slices. Two thumbs way up.	0
Hands down the best tacos I&#39;ve ever had. The menu is very interesting as they have created very unique taco choices. The ingredients are fresh and boy do the tacos taste good. My personal favorites are the flank steak, chicken tikka and buffalo chicken tacos. I will go back to try the others. <br><br>Food is priced reasonably cheap and the service is fast and efficient. The staff is really nice. Highly recommend!	1
The food was outstanding and the atmosphere very romantic. Great value for the money. There is parking on the side streets	0
Nojo was a no go. Everything was super salty! Items on the menu were generally the same... chicken. Guess it's a hipster kind of thing.	0
Fast-food BBQ - Just be warned!!<br><br>The food is decent but nothing to write home about. Sauce has a good taste and I thought the brisket was the best item on the menu. It was really tender and had the right amount of sauce. Don&#39;t get the bread - it is uncessary calories.<br><br>You feel pretty gross after you eat for several reasons: the seating is smooshed together, the food is greasy and obviously bad for you, and the place seems a bit...dirty. Sorry to say. <br><br>Parking is a big annoying too cause it is on a main street with lots of no-parking signs. The price isn&#39;t bad, but again it is fast food for sure.	0
Overrated. Overhyped. Whatever you call it.<br><br>After reading tons of reviews and getting a big expectation about to have one of the best meal in my life, I think it is just overhyped. Highly crowded. Nice ambience though. However, the thing is it has a terribly slow service, caused to hate my meal. Waited 25 minutes for dessert! It is hard to call a server because no one is looking for you within the crowd. Disappointed.<br><br>Cauliflower (4/5)<br>Goat cheese (3/5)<br>Baby octopus (2/5)<br>Goat empanada (5/5)<br>Goat belly (5/5)<br>Beers (4/5)<br>Desserts (2/5)	0
On a cold, blustery night, three friends and I were desperately in need of some delicious dessert. We felt so far from anything promising; Delancey St. might as well have been Timbuktu. And then, suddenly, Petee&#39;s appeared in an act of Yelpily divine intervention.<br><br>We were greeted by one of the owners (Petee&#39;s other half), who was equal parts warm and accommodating. He entertained our exhaustive probing about their pies, allowing us to forge a clear path toward our three selections: slices of Brown Butter Pecan Pie, a Salty Chocolate Chess (w/ whipped cream), and Blueberry (w/ vanilla ice cream). <br><br>Each pie was better than the next, all true 10/10&#39;s. The only thing better than the pies was the crusts, which I&#39;m convinced were a gift directly from the pie gods. And that&#39;s saying a lot for the kid who used to always leave the crust of everything (pies, pizzas, sandwiches, etc.) behind.	1
Q: Should we order:	1
Great food, great attention to detail and I look forward to hearing what their soup is for the day.<br><br>Wish they had more 1/2 soup / 1/2 sandwich options as I cannot always make the choice!<br><br>Great food and wonderful addition to the neighborhood.	1
Pricey: for wings? yesSize: smaller than normalTaste: Delish!I recommend the soy garlic and for those spicy lovers....the hot wings! Those tiny babies pack a flaming punch that will keep you drinking nonstop....well at least for me.	1
Excellent on all counts.  Sides were a bit all but steaks were huge and cooked to perfection.  I'll be back	1
Stumbled past this cozy little wine bar after my friend&#39;s birthday dinner and decided to stop in for more wine haha!<br><br>We were greeted and seated immediately by one of the two bartenders. Menus, water, and our wine came out within minutes of ordering (which we really appreciate!). My friends enjoyed their wine but I ended up getting beer (there&#39;s only 7) because I didn&#39;t see any italian reds or German riesling that I recognized on their menu. <br><br>The owner and staff seemed friendly, ambiance is soothing (the Middle Eastern music was a nice touch!) service was on point, and prices were reasonable. Will definitely be back to try the food next time!	1
Just popped into Next Door for lunch with a couple of friends after training that Twisted Fitness Gym just down the Road.	0
-Super easy to order through Yelp. I&#39;ve ordered for pick up and for delivery. Very quick! (Can pay with cash or credit.)<br>-Everything is packaged well in their proper to-go containers<br><br>What we ate:<br>-Guacamole, must be freshly made to order and is a decent portion (no brown spots at all)<br>-Tacos poblanos (soft taco) tried Bistec, Carnitas, Chorizo. All tasty. (Chorizo was the most greasy.)<br>-Tostada (flat hard shell) tried regular and carnitas. I preferred it with no meat on it. Nice and crispy. As a to-go item it remains crispy and in it&#39;s own container! A++<br>-Burritos: Shrimp and vegetarian, no complaints.<br><br>I will have to try to dine-in next time to optimize on the free chips and salsa and try some other entrees.	1
This place is so lame. Went once for dinner a few months ago and was unimpressed. <br><br>Used to enjoy brunch on a semi-regular basis until we were served a cold jumbo biscuit and took a break. Tried it again this weekend and were annoyed and shocked by a pre-fixed brunch menu with itty bitty food portions that are supposed to be &#34;shared.&#34; Please explain how a quarter of a waffle is to be shared? Maybe by mice.<br><br>The brunch starters (which you are forced to take) are some stale wannabe pita chips served with disgusting bland dips. Also, a &#34;basket of fresh pastries&#34; which ultimately means one small sweet bread and a super thin slice of some berry swirl bread. Sad.<br><br>Total let down.<br><br>Service leaves a lot to be desired. A LOT. Waiter was too busy serving alcohol to the table behind us to realize we needed more water - on more than one occasion. Had to flag someone down to point out the fact that we had no water. Zero. <br><br>Not worth the money, effort, experience. Go up Biscayne and get brunch somewhere better.<br><br>It&#39;s probably worth noting that this restaurant, like a few others in Miami, used to be a great hidden gem with fresh flavors, great portion sizes and amazing service. They were features on Diners, Drive Ins and Dives, and since then have never been the same. I guess they let the fame get to their heads and think that being on that show will excuse the fact that they redid their menu and lowered their quality of service. NOPE.	0
Mehhh...food was ok.	0
once upon a time i lived in downtown. 3rd &amp; san pedro, to be exact....on any lovely, none too hot day, i relished the walk to ye olde pantry. <br><br>and the giant plates of FOOOOOD. and the bread. oh, god! the bread!<br><br>the only way it could have been better would be providing a spot to nap in, post-food-orgy.	1
My go to sandwhich shop since they open..always good &amp; will 5 stars all around..but today (9/11/14 at 1pm) something is off with the sandwhich, the bread is kinda chewy or hard &amp; too much peppers.	1
Great service! The owner was very welcoming and helpful. Give this place a try	1
true tacos, thats what you get here. tacos de lengua, for example. yeah, youre right. lengua means tongue. what does that taste like? you dont have to ask andrew zimmern or neither of his two body guards. find out yourself at carnitas! it tastes like roasted pork straight out of la caja china, bro.<br><br>con sabor a mexico carnitas estilo michoacan. such a long name but i think that was done on purpose so hipster kids will never go here, which is a very noble reason... to name your establishment something only native spanish speakers can pronounce. sorry hipster kids of miami-dade. this is what happens when all the spanish you ever learned comes from gloria estefan and the miami sound machine. now youre practically monolingual, hate your grandma and wear skinny jeans. youre fucked, kid.<br><br>service at carnitas estilo michoacan is also monolingual. are you surprised? keep going to taco bell then, get your crunchy doritos-taco-pistolero-loco with extra sour cream too, cause you suck. tacos at carnitas are served on corn tortillas and thats it. chopped onions, cilantro, lime and sauces will be on your table or at the counter. wherever you choose to sit.<br><br>cash only.	1
Almost hidden away, deep into the abyss of a dark narrow alley in Little Tokyo, is a quaint and charming bar lounge with an atmosphere that is inviting, relaxed, slightly dim yet cheery. Unusually sandwiched between two brick buildings, the venue is narrow in width and long in length.<br><br>They offer artisan craft beers such as those brewed by Stone, as well as a vast selection of Japanese imported beers. They also offer rather hard-to-find Allagash Curieux which is an eclectic beer fermented in whiskey barrels. Ask for wasabi fries if you like garlic fries smothered in a light wasabi sauce. I find this unusual combination to work harmoniously and deliciously.<br><br>The bartender is extremely helpful by giving small beer samples from tap for your tasting notes. There&#39;s no way you can order a beer you don&#39;t like. Overall, I give 4.75.	1
This was an all-around awesome brunch experience.<br><br>I thought the service was great and more friendly than any restaurant I&#39;ve been to lately. I found the menu to be concise, but diverse with tasty options for all. Plus, you can&#39;t be $8 entrees!<br><br>It was quiet and cozy and I stand behind what they do 100%! Tips go back to the charity organization, so &#34;pay up&#34; as they say ;-)	1
WONDERFUL new spot in the neighborhood. Food is amazing, staff is truly amazing. I wish they had a slightly larger menu, but why mess with a good thing? Really great for this part of the hood.	1
I went here on one of those coupon deals - in short, I was delighted!<br><br>Great appetizers, great entree&#39;s, fun staff - in total, I cannot wait to return here	1
My boyfriend and I went to Toast last night in search of a veg-friendly, healthy meal....and we found it! We drove by and for once it wasn't crowded so we decided to stop in for dinner. I had the soup and salad combo with veggie soup and the tucson salad- instead of chicken I substituted a veggie patty and got their house vinaigrette on the side instead of the ranch. The veggie patty was one of the best I've tried yet!The salad was so tasty with black beans, corn, cilantro, tomato and tortilla strips. My boyfriend got the Toast salad which had goat cheese, pine nuts and sun dried tomatoes tossed in their house vinaigrette....he ate the whole thing and said he loved it! I ran into Ali Larter on the way to the ladies room....I guess she's somewhat of a "celebrity"....I still only remember her from her whipped cream bikini days on Varsity Blues....Anyways, I'll definitely be back! I can't wait to try out their breakfast because the menu looks delectable!	1
As a Louisiana native, I wanted to like this place as soon as I heard about it. If you're craving good 'ole Southern comfort food in SF, your options are severely limited. The bar was bustling on a Friday after work, and while the place was loud and a little trendy, it was also comfortable and we could easily hear each other talk at our table. There were some nice Southern touches, like drinks served in mason jars, mismatched silverware, and dish towels for napkins. We ordered the fried okra and oysters and the crab puffs and they were both yummy.Dinner was another story. Not only was the food not authentic, some of it was inedible. I ordered the Fried Chicken, which was okay, but the "Southern greens" consisted of bok choy cooked in horseradish. Not only was it gross (collard or mustard greens should have been used) I couldn't even eat it b/c the horseradish was so strong. The mac & cheese was also so spicy I couldn't eat it either. There's more to cooking Southern food than putting cayenne in everything! The grits in my friends' Shrimp and grits were watery and gross and some of the other flavors, like the seasoning on the catfish, were just off. There is no way this chef has ever spent more than a weekend below the Mason-Dixon line.Go for the drinks and appetizers. Leave when it's time for dinner.	0
A much needed restaurant/bar in the area! A fairly basic menu but all the food is done extremely well. Pair that with a great tap list and a fireplace and there you won&#39;t mind it&#39;s the only place nearby since you won&#39;t want to leave.<br><br>I&#39;ve been four times and have yet to order something that wasn&#39;t delicious, from the brunch, lunch, or dinner menus. Good wait service and good bartending makes it easy to like Bluebird.	1
Opened just last week in the stunning new Four Seasons Hotel in downtown Seattle Fonte Coffee Roasters newest location is a great place to grab a cup and relax.	1
Don&#39;t go for the food.<br><br>First time there and ordered Conch fritters, because they are one of my favorites, but these were way over cooked and the conch were like little pebbles in each bite, almost as they were previously frozen or something.<br><br>Also order the Fajita Roll, came out as something completely different than described on t he menu. Salsa was crap and the food mediocre at best.<br><br>As a side not, thought it was pretty shady waitress ran my card without giving me a itemized check, but added gratuity onto the bill. I noticed the amount was kinda high, and asked for the check. Also thought it was kinda suspect she even added gratuity onto the bill since I was by myself.	0
I feel like this may be my new go to local Korean place. Sometimes at other family owned Korean restaurants I get this &#34;who is this white girl in my restaurant&#34; vibe which I find annoying since I&#39;ve probably been to Korea more recently than they have. Not at this place. They are REALLY friendly. It&#39;s a clean hip little spot, and the food is fresh and good. I feel like I will be coming back regularly so really hope this place succeeds!	1
High prices, small portions, Americanized Chinese food, not a single native Chinese in the place. In all fairness, I never tried the food due to an excessively long wait. However from what I could see, it was the most Americanized Chinese food yet.	0
Overall i think the place had to much hype about it.The food tasted like quickly prepared diner food/borderline cafeteria food to me. The sides were super bland and the main courses we ordered didn't fall too far from that tree either.Its cool that it has plenty of history and such behind it, but the food was really off for me.	0
They are okay. Here is my rundown:- They don't pick up the phone so eff a pick up order.- The burger patty itself tastes like school meatloaf/salisbury steak- The fries are soft and greasy in 2 seconds. - No wow factor. I got the spicy one with an egg. It was mehhhh...Final thought: I would have rather walked a little down the block to McDonalds.	0
Great small pizza place, you better expect to wait for a table. Small cozy pizza place which is good for small groups of diners. The pizzas are made in a brick oven so they are top of the line. Save space for the dessert, i recommend you try the s&#39;more calzone!	1
Grilled cheese and tomato soup were on point! The turkey club with onion jam was amazing and the right amount of sweet vs. savory, but the avocado and bacon grilled cheese was out. of. this. world. Eating quarters are a little cramped, but the food is worth it!	1
This is a great place to bring your Grandma. She won't be frazzled by any vibrant mariachi music. She won't have to ask you why there are so many "Hispanics" in this "restaurant." There won't be any salsa varieties to confuse her deteriorating mind. She might even like the soapy taste in the cups they provide.It comes down to a matter of personal values with Papalote. Yes, the food tastes good and the ingredients are of high quality. It is also expensive and void of atmosphere. The portion sizes are small for the price and they only give you one tiny cup of salsa.Worst, worst of all. They have no scruples at Papalote about playing that old dirty trick - "Do you want sour cream, guacamole, and cheese?" Hell yeah I do. Oops...yeah...that's another two bucks added to your charge before they ring you up. Who can say no to that unfair question? I'm on a budget here and I don't need to waste my time being tricked by an unloving and over-hyped burrito pusher.	0
Eat here!!! Drink here!!! The food and service and excellent and the prices are extremely reasonable. Enjoy!	1
i had wrote another review about this restaurant and it was good but tonight the service and food were just bad! first i ordered chicken curry, but i meant with rice, and they gave me noodles, i didnt know there was chicken curry noodles. i didnt eat it for a while and nobody came to ask what was wrong. theen i just ate the noodles. and it was bad.	0
Typical trendy spot for drinks and a small bite. Menu is simple with options for small plates, which I can appreciate. <br><br>Free validated parking is always a plus!	1
Beautiful restaurant in a great hotel (Wynn). My first time in the hotel. Much nicer than most.Go for 'family style' and the server selects the menu. awesome way to go with customers/business meal.	1
I always come here bc the tacos are so good but every time I get the worst service. I keep giving them another chance but they seriously need to get it together with their horrible service. I timed it on my phone and it took 10 min before a server came over and that was after I flagged him down. He rudely told me to hold on. Exactly 20 min after being here we finally got our drinks. Food was fantastic. But once again service was terrible. They should have more servers on if they can&#39;t give good service	0
Very confusing seating process. We were left standing in a hall walkway until the staff rounded up enough people to fill a tepenyaki table. I was never asked if I wanted a table for two, which I did. We were herded upstairs like cattle an seated at a cramped table way in the back. Our server was very attentive and really pushed the drinks- perhaps softening the blow of the lousy experience to come? Hmmmmm. Our chef, James, appeared and told us his sad family story about having a surprise baby and having to work holidays to pay for it... He flat out stated that he didn't want to be there at the restaurant, and it showed. I kept looking over my shoulder to the other happy tables who were having fun and being entertained by their chef, and we all just sat there waiting to eat in silence. He cooked my shrimp for so long, I was going to take them off the table myself, but it was too late. They were already rubber... Boring chef, overlooked food, and being made to feel like we were imposing... Awful experience all around.	0
This place is like Pink Taco meets Eveleigh. Big space with high ceilings, long tables and cool art. The concept is really basic but packs a punch, take traditional mexican street food, but focus on using the best sustainable, organic ingredients, thats where you get the good taste. I love the guacamole, and the steak tacos stood out the most delicious meal to me. This places gets really busy and is great for a date or a night out. They offer valet parking in the front.	1
I work across the street from Joanna&#39;s and so far everything I&#39;ve had from their sandwiches, soups, salads, prepared meals, their pastries and baked goods are great!! The only downside some things are a tad expensive but for what you get its high quality and tastes delicious. Thier service is fast and they have a wide selection of just about anything I highly recommended to stop on by and try something new to people who are tired of the fast food spots.	1
Wow I was expecting the same great food as Malatesta down the street, not so. We shared the grilled Calamari, it was way over cooked, rubbery. The portion was really small compared to Malatesta. I had the Lasagna Bolognese. It was ok, but they put tons of sauce on top and it tasted from a jar. My friend had Spaghetti &amp; Clams, it was very bland. <br>Such a shame, cute restaurant and great location, average food. Next time I will walk 2 more blocks to Barbuto.	0
Really bad sushi. The algae used was thick and hard. Roll was small and the fish not fresh at all	0
The place is very new. I had the chance to attend to its opening next week and came back today during my lunch time. They offer typical italian sandwiches, panini and salads. I had a panino with tuna. Also had a glass of wine and an espresso. Loved everythig about it. <br>It was a delicious experience. Ingredients were genuine, maybe imported - def going back!	1
We were there 07/29/12 at 930pm and the restaurant was full at the time. Big commotion at the booth next to us - they got up, screamed and ran away from the table. We looked over and saw a HUGE cockroach (approx 2 inches long) crawling across the seat of the booth. The manager quickly ushered those people out of the restaurant. I also asked to speak to the manager since we had just started eating and the manager was immediately defensive saying things like &#34;It didnt touch you&#34; &amp; &#34;we&#39;re in Nevada, you know how it is&#34;. During this time a few employees stood there, looked at the roach crawling around and walked away. Not one person cared enough to kill it or to apologize to those of us who saw it. The manager had no interest in hearing what I had to say or in trying to make the situation &#39;right&#39;, and actually told me &#34;You&#39;re not coming back here again anyway, so why should I bother to do anything&#34;. SERIOUSLY?. Needless to say, our appetites were ruined, we sent the remainder (over 1/2 of each plate) of our food back and got stuck with a $55 bill. We should have walked out like the table on the other side of us.	0
After you get through the noise of the Monte Carlo casino you are transformed into the quiet, elegant oasis of Andre's.  The intimate atmosphere and meticulous attention to detail makes for a delightful dining experience.  Staff is friendly but non-intrusive.  Every item on the menu is presented in an artful way and prepared perfectly.  The lobster thermidor and veal chop are our favorites!  The wine list comes on an IPad which makes for fun browsing and easy selection.  There are many choices for fine dining in Las Vegas, but Andre's is at the top of the list!	1
A piece of glass, the size of a small nail in my CRAB Cakes! Almost craked a tooth! <br><br>Total incridibility; from opening day I had been a fan, for luch, dinners, happy hours. The service was just ok, on this particular day. Usually very good. <br>It will take some time to go back, if ever!	0
Pricey for what you get. All of the cooked items were delish. The sushi (tuna) was plain tiny and a bit fishy. Don't know that I would go again.	1
The service and food were amazing.  The view is breathtaking.  We have a wonderful Valentine's Day dinner.  Couldn't have asked for more.  Pricy but worth it.	1
The worst thing there is the customers service!!!The waitors always Hurry the customers. I am there to take my time to enjoy the food but not to dine in a restaurant like a fast food!	0
Once you find it in the maze which is the Venetian you have a great experience.  The Italian and Mediterranean seafood is great.  We were in Venice last year and the atmosphere was close.  While your in the middle if it all the atmosphere is very private. Good service and on time.	1
Suck 62 - I saw Rosario Dawson there once. That's the only reason why I'm giving at least 1 star.	0
I&#39;ve heard from many people &amp; from TV &amp; from online that Little Dom&#39;s is great and I&#39;ve been wanting to try it for a long time. The only thing is that I&#39;m never on that side of town. Luckily I was recently &amp; stopped in for an early dinner. Even though it was a Saturday evening, we still were seated right away with no reservation. We sat in the back room looked like maybe it was a deli or something separate in the mornings? I liked sitting separate it was quieter in there. Our server was super attentive and checked back on us many times throughout our meal to make sure everything was going well. We started with kale salad that was interesting. At first I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d like it, but after a few bites I really thought it was tasty. Then we ended up splitting a pizza with proscuitto &amp; egg. Yummmm. The crust is very crisp &amp; thin (if you like thick crust, you prob won&#39;t like it). Wish I had room for dessert to try the budino but there was no room at all. They have valet parking but we found a great spot on the street. Cute area &amp; really great pizza.	1
Yeeeeeeeee!!!! So Ono bruh!	1
I remember when this was a lesbian club back in the day...Tuna tartar!....yumAlmond crusted goat cheese....yummyPumpkin Ravioli...yummier Roast Tenderloin of Pork...yummiest FLOURLESS CHOCOLATE CAKE....OMG!!!!!! Take me here and you just may get into my pants....	1
go for: drinks at the bardon't go for: food or serviceWe went here for drinks and snacks on a Saturday afternoon. The patio is lovely and I liked the brick walls between the buildings, felt like an alley cat. The two servers didn't look at us when we entered and walked by nor did they acknowledge our presence for a good while. We got some menus finally and then waited another 25 minutes to get our order taken but since we were thirsty, having just left work, we had given up on the waitress taking our order and ordered our drinks at the bar. I was curious about the food, so I ordered the vegetable plate. 40 minutes later, the saddest veg plate in the world came to our table with an unappetizing, measly spread of cold, uncooked eggplant (three small pieces) 4 puny mushroom caps, a few strips of red and yellow peppers and no asparagus like the menu promised and they still charged us $8 for such a piece of shit plate. Seriously 40 minutes we waited for a dish that was mostly unedible. without even an apology. We had ordered the Naan bread but it wasn't until she brought us the plate of sad, limp veggies that she mentioned, no Naan for you. So my advice, go to the bar, order some good beer, enjoy the patio but stay away from ordering the food and interacting with the incompetent servers (at least they were friendly). BTW, it wasn't at all busy when we were there. Maybe only a few tables of equally thirsty, unserved people.	0
Homestyle korean food tucked in between the matzoh factories and $1 dollar stores of E. Williamsburg. Daily specials, bibimbap and bahn mi on the menu.	1
I am not a fan. Giant clam was too much for me, it's fishy and chewy. I like the shrimp tho. We were there for the first time, but the waiter did not bother to tell us what to expect and how are they going to prep for us. They are actually a little rude "force" grilling for us. And the air quality was horrible, and we constantly burn ourselves even with the gloves they provided. A very unpleasant dinner experience. If you like seafood, there are tons of other choices.	0
Went there for lunch a couple of weeks ago looking forward to a fresh and flavorful lunch. 	1
I was a regular at Phoenecia for years. Hussein's food was masterful. Since is sudden passing last year the community has missed him his family and the joy his resturaunt brought.	1
Overpriced, no flavor, might as well be at Olive Garden. If this place doesn&#39;t stop overcharging people and get a better chef, they will surely close down.	0
I come here from time to time. Their trademark definitely is their friendliness and how they greet you by your name, they make you feel welcomed. <br><br>The food is great, they take pride on what they do, they&#39;re faster than other sub places. They try to be unique by adding a couple of items to their menu that other sub places lack. Definitely you have to give the garlic steak sub a shot. <br><br>The place is always cleaned, dining room and restrooms are impecable.<br><br>No complaints just complements. I extremely recommend it. Guaranteed to make you come back again and again. <br><br>Warning: this place can cause an addiction to steak subs.	1
The service was excellent and so was the food. we didnt want to leave.	1
After hearing about Bandera for months, I was really excited to try the restaurant. To be honest, I didn&#39;t get what all the hype was about. The food was bland and uninspiring. I had the Bandera-style roasted chicken, which was so/so, and the mashed potatoes, a huge disappointment. Almost every dish is served with Spanish rice. Nothing on the menu deserves the prices Bandera commands.<br><br>Overall, I&#39;d recommend going across the street to The Purple Pig or leaving that tourist trap that is Michigan Avenue altogether. Bandera&#39;s food is just not spectacular.	0
We have lived in Issaquah for 12 years now and we thought we had eaten everywhere. But oh no we had let this little gem of a place slip by. First Edna is awesome she is without question a world class chef we are extraordinarily lucking to have her. My wife and I were online looking for a date night when we noticed the reviews for Max's. We called at 4	1
I&#39;ve given this place multiple chances because I like the one in midtown. Every time I go there is a problem. <br>I have had fish tacos with raw fish. Philly cheese steak with so much salt that no one could eat it. Wings that were uncooked in the center. <br>On top if that every time I go they seem to be out of beer. They run out of most of the items on the menu. Run out of containers or bags. It&#39;s always something. <br>The service is pretty bad. Only way to not wait 15 minutes for a refill is to sit at the bar and even then you take your chances. <br>The manager here obviously has no idea how to run a restaurant. The cook does not no how to cook the most basic of foods. Go to gauchos next door until this place gets shut down and something better opens up. <br>The sad part is that it is the perfect place for a good sports bar. Unfortunately their execution is terrible. I knew if the company new how bad this franchise was they would pull the plug or get someone who knows what they&#39;re doing.	0
longs lines for good reason!<br>banana pudding is the best<br>I haven&#39;t had a bad meal or experience here in the 6 or so times I have eaten here.<br>prices are not bad	1
so yum - great breakfast place!	1
Great place and the deck rocks!!	1
This restaurant bar would earn 3 to 3.5 stars had I not been enticed to go to the Saturday eve dinner and burlesque show...The service is good, the food is good (not exceptional, but good), the patio on a nice day is great... but the hardly Burlesque show was g-d awful.	0
Almost Paris. I wasn't totally into eating at the hotel BUT then they had a patio and the weather was perfectly mild since it was barely 10am AND it just looked like a scene right out of a Paris postcard. The woven chairs, the street view and the sweetest most-hipster waiters in the world completed the pic. Pure perfection. I had the gravlax (made in house) with herbed cream cheese toast and B had steak and eggs. I've never seen scrambled eggs in that circle configuration before but they were heavenly obviously ;). Service is excellent - sincerely friendly, quick and beyond professional. The perfect breakfast outside of that Paris cafe in my dreams.	1
Used to be one of my go to spots, at least once a week, Unfortunately from repeated bad experiences I cannot go here anymore, when I wanted beans on my arepa they charged me 3.50 and smothered it in the beans and juice, now the arepa was so soggy that the paper they serve it on was being cut up and attaching to my food. Also when my dates food arrived they barely put any meat in it (I know their portions because I would frequent here) when I asked for more they gave me what looked liked the overcooked oily scrapings from the grill, on top of it this all took over 45 minutes, and the lady who took our order was very unpleasant and Nasty to us, What happened to good customer service, And considering this place is way overpriced for a damn arepa, you think the repeat business would be enough for them to treat us right......	0
Chipotle is far more better than this place. This place had no veggies to go in my burrito. Even the rice was overcooked. Overall bland food. Vegetarians please stick to chipotle. It is complete value for money	0
The atmosphere is a little different than what I'm used to. It's a dimly light diner and it's p cool I guess. The people that work there are friendly and have an interesting taste in fashion. The food was p good. I got the Paul Bunyan Steak and Eggs. It was good, the steak was alright, the hash browns were good and made a little differently from what I'm accustomed to, and the scrambled eggs were buttery.My friends had a Jucy Lucy burger and a Veggie burger. The Jucy Lucy looked awesome. It was a good sized portion and my friend added avocado which made it look so much better. He also got the onion rings which looked like the best onion rings I've ever seen. The vegetarian burger looked aight (not my kind of thing lol). Would come back.	1
Wow the name is perfect this probably wasn&#39;t the best choice before a night of heavy drinking..... so full it&#39;s hard to consume beer too! The bbq burger was the best the one with mushrooms was our last favorite. Of the four we tried. The fried egg one was decent but the fiesta one was second best. Wow on the garlic parmesan fries. And complimentary cookies were a great bonus! The older male that served uswas so nice and helpful. Will definitely be back	1
My BF and I lived close to the Alsatian region a couple of years ago, so we were very excited when I came across this restaurant! We ordered the following:<br><br>Tarte Flambee (La Mer): The crust was super thin and crisp--I loved it. The salmon, spinach and creme fraiche toppings were a very simple but tasty combination. One issue I had was that it came out at room temperature. We did request that every dish come out at the same time, so that probably had something to do with it. Wish they had kept it warm, but regardless, it was still really delicious--which says a lot! <br><br>Spaetzle (Gambrinus): The meat was extremely tender (and they were nice big, plentiful chunks). The foundation of the flavors (they use Meteor beer) was pretty spot on, but it was a bit underseasoned (I think a tad more salt would&#39;ve brought out the flavors more). The spaetzle itself was good but a little mushy. I would&#39;ve preferred them pan-fried. We thought this needed some minor tweaks but overall has potential to be really great.<br><br>French fries: Don&#39;t know what kind of oil they fried their potatoes in, but they were really good! Crisp on the outside, soft in the middle and a good, deep flavor.<br><br>Creme Brulee: Yum, it&#39;s solid. Order it.<br><br>Soju cocktail with strawberries: If you are into fruity drinks, please order this. Basically tasted like a delicious strawberry juice. I should note that it&#39;s a bit light on the alcohol, but that was fine for me (because I get tipsy after a bottle of beer). <br><br>Overall, good food. With some changes, could be really, really great. To boot, all the people were super friendly and welcoming. I wish the lights were dimmed down a bit more, though. My BF and I decided we will definitely come back to this restaurant, and we don&#39;t say that lightly in a city replete with restaurants we&#39;ve yet to try!	1
After a night of drinking, I decided that I couldn't even move myself off of the couch and thought immediately of dialing up this place to fulfill my case of endless drunchies. BEST FISH TACOS EVER. Drunchies or no drunchies, these were pretty freakin' bomb.	1
This review is of the bar only. I'm sure their food is very nice.This place is walking distance from my house, and my roommates always get very excited at the prospect of going here. I'm sorry, but the prospect of sitting in an empty bar (at the bar, actually, so you can only really talk to the person next to you) at a stuffy, fancy restaurant and paying $10+ for a drink does not appeal to me. Also, literally empty. Not a single person there besides the people you come with. For an expensive night, I'd much rather go to one of the nicer bars downtown.	0
All Del Frisco's DE Steakhouses are not created equal.  This one has tvs in the dining room, which had people shouting about a football game.  Appropriate for a bar, perhaps, but not a restaurant.  Good was good; not amazing.  For the price point I expected a better ambiance.  The DFDE in Chicago, in my view, is far superior to the Las Vegas outpost.	1
Visited Stephi's recently for dinner and had a very good meal with a good dining experience.  The place was good crowded but not too noisy....food was excellent and the server (Sarah) was outstanding...definitely recommend a visit.	1
We passed by this newly opened bar and just had to peek in. It&#39;s a great place for girls night out or an intimate evening. <br><br>Drinks - We each ordered a different drink (the names are cheeky!) from the cocktail menu. I got the Rubby&#39;s White Lies which is mainly a coconut flavored drink. It was a bit too sweet for my liking but the flavor was great.<br><br>Venue - Small and intimate. The bathroom even has a chalkboard for those who want to spill their secrets.<br><br>Music - Spice Girls to Macklemore - the music selection certainly covers a few generations.<br><br>Service - Our waitress was friendly. The owner even came by our table of five and welcomed us and explained how the place got started.	1
Went here for the first time today, for brunch. All I have to say is the eggs benedict w/ vegetarian canadian bacon was uh-may-zing.<br><br>Don&#39;t really know about any of the other dishes b/c the two other people i was with ordered the same thing.<br><br>And the patio is sooooo cute. Can&#39;t wait to go back and try to prove all the people who say the food is mediocre wrong. Will update then....	1
My pops used to take us as kids and now I bring my son to Canters whenever we're in the area! The sandwiches are tasty and filling, the coleslaw is refreshingly yummy, and the chicken noodle soup is perfectly comforting and tasty on a cool day! Call me crazy but the flavor combination of there pickles with a sip of coke is amazing! PS...the sandwiches are large enough for two! Just make sure you get an extra side of coleslaw!	1
Completely overpriced food. I had a small piece of salmon and it cost me $22. It was just plain. Come here more for the scene. Lots of beautiful drunk people here looking to mingle. So if you're single, you may love it. Parking will suck at night. This area is known for taking a long time to find parking. If you don't mind valeting, do it. But that's another $5 please. Servers will take forever to come back to you after rotating befween lots of people. Meh.	0
These 5 stars are not for the meat, but the AH-MAZING veggie burger and ice cream sandwich. Now normally you get a veggie burger, it's just some Gardenburger or frozen patty, right? I don't know if Umami freezes theirs, but it's DELICIOUS (I know, I can't emphasize it enough). Their "Earth Burger" is a super crispy (dare I say, deep fried?) patty of edamame and mushrooms with a fantastic garlic aioli and truffle ricotta all on toasty buns. It looked small, but for me it was actually quite filling. Leave room for dessert, because their ice cream sandwich (cookies and cream) was like a giant macaron. Circular in shape, the sandwich part was crispy and soft just like a macaron, and the ice cream was fantastic.Yes, it's on the expensive side, but SO worth it. Skip the sides and stick with these two for the win.	1
Good food. GREAT service. If you're in this neck of the woods, definitely drop in. The wasabi fries are a little overrated, but the salads are very fresh. And did I say how friendly and on point the staff is?	1
Ever since I was 5 and after every AYSO game, my mom and dad would bring me here even though we lived up on Mulholland Dr and the games were played in Beverly Hills, yeah a bit off route but whatever. <br><br>I dont come here as much anymore, but everytime I do come I think to myself &#34;If I had to eat 2,000 calories in a single meal, this is where I would come&#34; <br><br>Their hamburgers are grilled to perfection, and their root beer floates are TOO DIE FOR!!!! then again you might die from a cardiac arrest or something if you come and get as many items off the menu as 3 or 4 for yourself..<br><br>The building is like a stubborn little kid who wants to sit/be placed around all the big kids, and this deserves to be with the big kids.	1
The Far Bar is located through an alley in Little Tokyo and trust me if you haven't been here I understand why you would feel a bit skeptical but as soon as you peek inside you suddenly feel bad for ever thinking badly of this place or wanting out! There are lights hanging over when you walk in which gives the place a very mellow, peaceful, and even romantic vibe. This bar can be a second stop to pick up some sushi or maybe those last drinks. They have a happy hour Tues-Fri 4-7pm and Sun-Mon 4pm-2am. This is an alley I will definitely be visiting again!	1
get here before 9 and you dont have to wait in line downstairs. this place is pretty cool because you get to go in two elevators in order to get to the roof. then its an inside/outside restaurant/bar. the food is super amazing. try the bone marrow! <br>the cool part of the outside bar is that its split into two. theres one thats a higher level on the other side that consists of just a bar. just walk around the side and you can find the entrance there. its super romantic because you can see the view of downtown. great date spot!!!	1
Honestly, My friend and I have been here once, but i dont think we're coming back.The service is mediocre and food portions are just really ridiculous and not worth it. I ordered the cirashi sushi and there were only like 5 pieces for 16 bucks? WOW, and the thing is if its fresh, i wouldn't mind, but this is just not worth it period. I guess this place is a tourist attraction, thus high prices, for low quality food. I'd rather go to shabu shabu or ramen over OOmasa anytime!	0
El Atlakat is my go to place for a delicious flavorful breakfast at any time of day! My usual pick here is the simple breakfast. It includes 2 eggs (scrambled or sunny side up) refried beans, crema, as well as a slab of white cheese, depending on the season, either avocado or fried plantains and two tortillas. They have other varieties some include steak others the eggs come with ham or tomato or both. Other honorable mentions are the pupusa mixta ( a tortilla filled with yummy goodness its very greasy not the healthiest choice on the menu but very savory i recommend dipping it in crema) the sopa de res is some of the best I&#39;ve had, and the mixed platter is also delicious and a great way to go when you just feel like having finger food. Service is pretty good, i have been enjoying this restaurant for years with my family and look forward to continue visiting them	1
Great date night spot! Great views, amazing food, all around romantic place to visit!	0
Parking lot is quite small and tonight it was tough getting into a spot. Also, the local streets were pretty occupied too. Took me about 40 minutes before a parking spot opened up in the Canter's lot. I ordered a Monte Cristo to go. Canter's version of the MC is a French toast with some shredded ham and turkey. Canter's also skipped out on putting the jam with the Monte Cristo and gave me a dill pickle instead. Defiantly wasn't worth the 16 dollars.With a small lot that was full, high prices, and abnormal dishes, I'd just skip out on returning the next time I'm in the area.	0
I came to eat and enjoy the free sangria deal. The offer was not honored , even though we were a party of three people, and only wanted 1 free sangria ($5.00). I got all sorts of excuses for them not being able to honor it. When I asked to speak to a supervisor, our server explained how he wasn&#39;t available. Although, she was in charge, she wasn&#39;t able to . So, if you go for the offer FORGET ABOUT IT .. The food is tasty	0
Food and service are similar to the name.	0
Alright so this place was probably my favorite of the whole trip to Madison. First.. Murphy's. That is a DELICIOUS beer! Second.. Sheppard's pie. Awesome! Service is awesome, place has AC, great location.. Wish I could try more but alas, time limits. I had several delicious beers here that I will definitely remember!	0
We ordered two items and it took 2hrs for delivery then the food was cold and disgusting. Goes to say will never order from this place again.	0
We had a reservation and I still got the George Constanza treatment. We were a party of two and we were placed right near the service entrance. My experience was having my chair kicked several times, the waiters butt&#39;s rubbing against my back multiple times and not to mention that after our bread had fallen on the floor because the table was tiny, the bread was taken away from us like a scolded child. Last but not least the table of six behind me that were so loud that I had to lean over the table to hear my date. Oh, I had to tell the waiter we were finishing our bottle of wine after being pestered about the check. We felt very rushed and even the bus boy tried to clear my plate before my date was finished with hers. I would expect premature clearing of plates at Applebee&#39;s.<br><br>The food? Bone marrow was good, black label burger was good but it wasn&#39;t frites it was more like frozen fries. I&#39;ve had much better at half the price. <br><br>Not at all impressed. More like a tourist trap.	0
We always go there for dinner whenever we are in town.	1
Friday night, packed, a refreshing Hendricks Martini in one hand and a warm winter night on the other. <br><br>My stomach was felling greedy, I was feeling demanding. The ceviche was ravishing, the amber jack amazingly crisp.<br><br>My duck breast arrived, I was too busy enjoying the atmosphere. My focus swiftly moved to the crispy duck in front of me as soon as the fork reached my mouth. Ravishing.<br><br>I was smiling. Time flew. My stomach thanked me at the end!	1
The food is great. Martin the owner and cook is a personality that adds to a wonderful experience	0
I ate lunch here a couple months ago. Burger was kinda good and so was the pretzel. But I dont think either were anything special.	0
My husband and I were able to get a last minute Friday night dinner date reservation here, and we were so glad we did. BXL Zoute is delightful. I like the other BXL&#39;s, but don&#39;t always want to go to midtown for Belgian food, so this is a good location.. more accessible for the downtown crowd. Overall, a good crowd too. One of my downtown pet peeves is that there are only ever 20-somethings out at bars and restaurants; it&#39;s usually very homogenous. But at BXL Zoute, it was a good mix of 20&#39;s, 30&#39;s, and 40&#39;s.<br><br>We went straight for the moules frites; I chose the Vin Blanc et Creme. The large black pot of mussels was served typically, with a side of fries (with ketchup and mayo), and the delicious savory broth at the bottom. We were also provided a side of bread and butter for dipping. A perfect winter meal.<br><br>The service is what makes BXL Zoute great though. The mussel shells were emptied constantly. The timing of the meal was perfect. And all the servers we encountered were very kind. <br><br>So I&#39;ve been to Belgium, and I&#39;ve been to Monk&#39;s in Philadelphia. And the BXL&#39;s, B Cafe&#39;s, and Markt can&#39;t live up to the greats. But BXL Zoute takes the gold medal for Belgian food here in New York.	1
Great place to be with helpful friendly staff. Great dim sum too... The shots are amazing and the introduction to tiffany and her fig vodka was &#39;special&#39; The staff all made our holiday a great one and certainly kept us hydrated! What a fab bunch of people. <br>(Uk)	1
Eh. I was unimpressed with the food here. Of course I didn&#39;t expect &#39;authentic&#39; Mexican, considering the location. But just the overall quality of the food was kind of disappointing. I did enjoy the salsa and chips, but my tostada was not appetizing. The beans tasted old and the chicken didn&#39;t have much flavor.<br><br>My boyfriend orderd fajitas and I had to end up eating some of his food since I really didn&#39;t like mine. The fajitas were fine, but fajitas are pretty simple, not hard to screw up.<br><br>We will not be returning.	0
For checking in on yelp, I received a free soda. That was a nice bonus, although I&#39;m not a big fan of soda and rarely drink it. I&#39;ve been here a few times, and I would have to say that my favorite part about eating here is that you can have unlimited orders of &#34; ,&#34; which is this thing where they put rice, kimchi, seaweed, fried egg, and sesame oil in a tin can sort of a thing, and shake it to mix it. It&#39;s something that Koreans in the old days used to eat, and it is delicious. Their meat is not bad, I would have to say. It&#39;s pretty hard to find places these days that serve a good enough $9.99 AYCE meat, and so most of the times you have to resort to going to places that are like $16.99, $17.99, etc. and I would probably recommend this place to people. If you go during the dinner time, it is pretty busy -- we waited quite a while to get seated, although it was extra hard for us because we were a group of 8. <br><br>I also care a lot about their rice paper, and theirs was soft and chewy. Definitely passed the test for me. But I think what makes me give them a 4 star instead of 5 is the fact that you have to valet park unless you find street parking, and the fact that the wait can be kind of long. The pans are also pretty small, and because they were so busy, all 8 of us ended up getting seated together in a small... 4-6 people round table. One grill for the 8 of us? I don&#39;t know.. haha	1
I heard that this is probably the best deli for pastrami, and while I am no connoisseur, I really did enjoy the sandwich! We arrived around 6:30pm and just barely beat the rush! This place was poppin!<br><br>We ordered:<br>- pastrami sandwich (split between the 2 of us): lots of meat! It tastes really good with the deli mustard too!<br>- coleslaw &amp; potato salad sides: cold, fresh, slightly sweet<br>- matzo ball soup: we ordered this per Eli G&#39;s review recommendation. It just tastes like.. chicken soup. I always though matzo were just the flat cracker things, but I guess they can be balls in soups too :p<br>- onion rings: OMG I LOVE ONION RINGS, and these tasted awesome! They seemed a little bit.. fermented/alcoholic? but it was a really interesting taste :] yum yum yum<br><br>Just remember to track of what you ordered. Our waitress thought she brought everything, and I completely forgot about the onion rings. She brought them a few minutes later haha oops! There&#39;s even a little lot right next to it for easy parking. Yay!	1
Awesome addition to the southern restaurant scene in Northern Brooklyn, and it&#39;s great to see a Smorgasburg stand rise to the next level of brick and mortar. Love the fact each biscuit is named after the owners grandmothers, and it&#39;s the little touches like these that make every guest feel at home.<br><br>Definitely opt for anything with fried chicken and cheese, it&#39;s a time tested combo, and save room for red velvet cheesecake!	1
Simple review: Beer is good, food is below average for San Francisco. I know what pub food is supposed to be - not gourmet but yummy. This was just not good enough. Ick. The kind of food you eat half of because you are starving and then just stop because you can't take it. My friend had a mushroom pizza that looked like it had a can of mushrooms dumped on it after it had been cooked. She was literally sweeping them off. Many in my party were annoyed at the service, but I don't think it was really fair to judge because it was a Friday night and they were swamped. Have a beer - but don't eat here.	0
Great steakhouse! I'd try the caesar salad with any filet and you cant go wrong!	0
Ok, I wasn&#39;t impressed the first time I went there but wanted to give them another chance tonight. I&#39;m sorry to say I was even more disappointed this time. I understand the name is Smoque but that doesn&#39;t mean everything has to be smothered in that taste. It was a cross between that and burnt flavored. I&#39;m still trying to get the taste out of my mouth. The fries and brisket chili were decent, the baby back ribs and chicken were not. This was definitely not worth $26.00. I wont be back.	0
It would be nice if Westville would actually pick up their telephone! Bad customer service here	0
Best Latte yet. Raspberry bar, panini's UUUUUUU.Right next to Campanile. Got to try	1
I went here with a Travelzoo coupon and used it for their weekend brunch. I was there with a group of 10 and the service was great. The brunch menu is limited, but there were a lot of good choices, so it was easy to make a decision. I love their limitless mimosas! I ordered their BLT+ avocado and fried egg. It was so big, I only ate half and brought the other half home. It comes with a side of potato chips. My friend&#39;s dishes looked equally tasty too. I was really impressed the staff was able to handle our large group on a Sunday morning. Thank you THE SIX!	1
SHIT MOTHER FUCKER FUCK SHIT!! Wait, there&#39;s a SHIT MOTHER FUCKER FUCK SHIT situation!? HELL YES my dears, I&#39;ve officially entered heaven right in the middle of nowhere in industrial hood of Gowanus!!<br><br>This is probably the most beautiful and surprisingly SPACIOUS cafe/casual dining space I&#39;ve EVER seen in ALL of NEW YORK CITY!! I saw Yelper Ina L. check into this place about a week ago and I was curious and decided to check the place out and I am SO glad I did!! Located in the industrial Brooklyn neighborhood of Gowanus, this place must be a gem in the neighborhood if not the entire borough. There ain&#39;t much to do or see in Gowanus except the canal, which btw is heavily polluted (if that&#39;s your thing) and its industrial charm/urban decay (which I&#39;m into) so finding this Mediterranean (Turkish) cafe/bakery/restaurant was like finding an oasis in the middle of the Sahara desert!<br><br>The space was formely an industrial warehouse which they did a SUPERB job in refurbishing and re-decorating it. They have outside seating areas with sofas and tables with BEAUTIFULLY decorated garden/walls. The interior is surrounded by beautiful exposed brick wall with a 2nd floor. It&#39;s very open, spacious, and VERY loft-like which I LOVE!!, There&#39;s also skylight right in the middle allowing the sun to pour it&#39;s rays right into cafe which was lovely, giving the space some pleasant glowing natural light and making the space that much cozy.<br><br>The staff are VERY friendly and superbly accommodating and surprisingly unpretentious. I ordered some Turkish Coffee and a Chocolate Mouuse (which btw was SUPERB!! DO GET IT!!) and lounged out in one of the comfortable sofas on the first floor. I ordered my food was told to have a seat, make myself comfortable, and that the coffee and the desert will be brought out to me when ready which was nice.<br><br>After lounging out on the first floor, I got a regular coffee and headed upstairs to the 2nd floor. Seriously, this place is HUGE!! The second floor also has a small patio/terrace area if you want to sit outside or to take in some sun/have a cigarette or what not. I stayed here for 3 hours using their WiFi and just and nobody said anything or gave me a nasty look and I was just so comfortable here like if it was my home away from home.<br><br>The Bahche is a lovely family-owned restaurant that is a perfect way to spend your afternoon in Gowanus in all types of weather.<br><br>5 THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW:<br><br>1) Restrooms are available and they are VERY clean and modern. It doesn&#39;t smell like piss in there!! Yayy!!<br>2) Their food is good and their desserts are Fabulous and made on-site!! I thought it can rival some of the best bakeries in the city. NO Minimum on Credit Cards!!<br>3) They have WiFi and TONS of electric outlets (towards the walls and the balconies on the second floor so if you want to get some work done, it&#39;s the BEST place to do!!)<br>4) If you have kids, no worries, there&#39;s a children&#39;s play area--so thoughtful!!<br>5) Don&#39;t complain on the limited menu, this ain&#39;t a Chinese takeout buffet where there are millions of choices but all taste the same and covered-up by a thick MSG infused heavy sauce.<br><br>I&#39;ll be back for sure, it captured my heart and I can declare it as one of my top favorite coffeeshops in Brooklyn!	1
I love The Roof on Wilshire, It&#39;s just so beautiful there! The rooftop bar was amazing and had a great view of the city. The rooftop drink menu is out of this world! And the food...all kinds of amazing food!	1
Came here because a friend said this place was comparable to Santa Ramen, it isn't. The place is small like when Santa was still on B street. We had kids so we all just squeezed in. The place calls it's self a ramen place, but their selection of ramen was limited. They were selling sushi and everything else. They had only a limited amount of ramens to chose from (miso, shio, shoyu, tonkotsu). I got myself the which was OK, the Miso was lacking in flavor.	0
It was my first time and will be my last visit. I don&#39;t know where and how this place got 4.5 stars from yelpers. There were 8 of us dined in tonight. We got separate bill and 20% tip was added to each bill. <br><br>My friends ordered chimichanga, burrito, kimchi fried rice, and pork sliders. I was the only one ordered pan fried fish. I asked if the they deep fried or breaded. The waitress told me they grilled the fish. What? But I&#39;m an adventurous food lover, so I went ahead and gave it a chance anyway. What a disappointment! My dish was the last to came out. The fish fillet was cold, bland, soggy, and felt apart as soon as I touched it with the fork, so I asked for a chopsticks instead. The vegetables, mostly broccoli, with few pieces of onion, and green bell pepper were also tasteless. I couldn&#39;t tell if they were grilled or pan fried. Standard Korean sticky rice came with it, nothing special. I barely eaten my food. Most of my friends didn&#39;t finish their neither. <br><br>I was going to get the Calypso Lemonade, but decided to skip it after how disappointed my food was. <br><br>My advice: spend your money elsewhere. This place doesn&#39;t worth the drive up to North Las Vegas.	0
Really heartbroken by our experience here. Visiting from Chicago - stopped in just for a good cocktail before dinner. Host mdade us wait to sit at the bar, which was fine.... then he directed us to the far end of the bar, which had some spaces opening up. The couple that had been sitting there offered us their seats. (So nice, thanks!!) We were then informed by not one, but two, rude bartenders that there was a WAIT LIST to sit at the bar and we would have to get up... I explained the host had directed us to those seats at the bar - and the bartender (rude one #1), said &#34;excuse me??&#34; I repeated myself and he said, &#34;well sorry about that...&#34; Husband and I left - our money is better allocated at other friendlier bars. :)	0
Went last night for the first time and loved it! Our waitress Stephanie was amazing. I wasn&#39;t sure what to expect from all the mixed reviews I read about food and service. The lobster pop tarts were delicious. We of course got the Marie Antoinette dessert. The cake that came with the cotton candy dish tasted pretty sweet lady jane status...nothing special. But I give 5 stars because waitstaff was super attentive and the food was not as bad as the reviews lead me to believe. The extravagant arrangements were a fun experience. I do however suggest making reservations before 8. The good service may have been due to the fact that the younger crowd wasn&#39;t there yet.	1
Crust-less french white bread, buttered and grilled- I got the B.E.L.T. (bacon, egg, lettuce, tomato and avocado). Soooooo delicious... <br><br>I really like all the different sodas they have- I ended up with a brooklyn root beer, not bad (but I still love Virgils more). <br><br>I chose the bacon and cheddar chips- not bad, but I bet they&#39;re better fresh! Service was pretty fast- I was probably their first customer of the day. There&#39;s parking in the back and metered street parking.<br><br>I LOVE the chairs in there- it&#39;s all the chairs that I used to have in elementary school. Brings back good memories...	1
OK 3 star food -1 for dirty -1 bad service = 1 star rating.	0
Palace Kitchen has a way with small plates and making you feel like a movie star. Incredible food served late! Artisan cheese plates and decadent pastas galore.	1
So we have become regulars at Heidelberg Haus. The food is authentic and makes us homesick for Germany. Martin the waiter is a hoot and always speaks German to our Granddaughter who calls him the Danke man.	1
I love this place! Everything is great, which as we all know is a rare find. If you haven&#39;t tried the olives, you are missing out. Also they make their own pita chips... Yummy! The owner is so friendly and really involved with the customers. Please support this restaurant, we need more quality places like this in the neighborhood!	1
Any place that puts cayenne pepper in their cocktails is where I want to be. If you're looking for a cool vibe, right up trend alley (Shuffle board, family style seating, awesome interior and drinks that sound as if they could be a meal...) This is your spot. I'll definitely be working my way through the drink menu.	1
Came here the other night to check out this new rooftop pool/lounge. It goes without saying that the views are breathtaking, but I was also pleasantly surprised at the friendly service.<br><br>Ordered the spinach salad which comes topped with a poached egg. No complaints here and I tried a few bites from friends&#39; plates. Eric Greenspan knows what he is doing and it shows.<br><br>Also loved the cocktails by the mixologist, try the Mulberry. I kept reordering it.<br><br>Glad to have found a new place in this neighborhood with amazing views, good food and a nice atmosphere. This will definitely be my new spot to impress a date.	1
I should give this man another shot. I don't think it's fair for me to give a bad review based on one time visit there. Yeah, I don't really like the chicken shawarma. But some people buying the falafel seemed to enjoy theirs. So I may be back to try other stuff so I can give a more comprehensive review.	0
Great burgers on fantastic buns. Every order comes with cookie baked by the owner Yummm <br>Don&#39;t miss ordering fries. Very different then you get at most places but so worth it.<br>Their hours are a bit strange so make sure they are open before you venture out	1
This place is the epitome of local hole-in-the wall : I had to drive around the block a few times to find it. Tip : Look for the flags.<br><br>I found this place via Yelp and decided to check it out. The wait is a little long, but the sandwich I got (Smoked Salmon and Goat Cheese + side salad) was fantastic - probably the best I&#39;ve had in a long time. It felt like all the ingredients were extremely fresh, and were carefully laid out to be even across the whole sandwich - it was great.<br><br>The side-salad was only 50 cents and good, i&#39;d recommend it with any sandwich. I&#39;ve only been here once, but it certainly was excellent and I&#39;ll be back to try out some of the other food offered here.	1
The Pechuga Rellena is so flavorful. You should definitely give it a try! Order an Horchata as well. :)<br><br>Breakfast is also delicious here.	1
In Marcel Proust's "Remembrance of Things Past, the taste of a madeleine cookie brings froth the rush of memories long forgotten. The Apple Pan is that way for me as I use to ride my bike here some 40 years ago.The only things to change are the old guys that use to serve me have be replaced by other old guys who have that no nonsense manner that comes with serving us (the great unwashed).The building (house) hasn't changed a bit. It's like that home in Atlantic City that refused to sell to the casinos and they built around it. The Apple Pan remains quaint and old fashioned surrounded by the modern world.You enter through a screen door and pass swinging doors to take your place along the wall to wait for a seat to open up at the counter. Decisions must be made, if a single seat opens do you take it? Who was here when you got here and how many are in their party? You eventually find a seat (I find staring at an diner and wishing they eat quickly, works effectively).The hickory burger is my goto. It is not really barbecue sauce as something more akin to the chili sauce you have been buying in the market for the twenty years. Crisp lettuce, crunchy pickles, soft bun and a fairly thin piece of meat makes for a hamburger from yesteryear that brings a rush of memory. French Fries are perfectly done crisp on the outside soft in the middle, when i was younger I never wanted to share any, nowadays I let the wife and kids have a few. No need for your fancy duck fat fries or belgium dipping sauces, all i need is that slab of ketchup that the old guy pours on the paper plate.The Pie is a wonder, others love the banana cream (sorry but I hate bananas in general. I am an apple guy. Ask for it heated up with a scoop of vanilla.I will take that pie over a madeleine any day.	1
This is a nice place. We found it by accident on way to Griffith Park Observatory. We sat outside and enjoyed good food and drinks. The menu is interesting and the place is pretty cool. We would return. 4-stars and not 5 because we were happy, would recommend, but we&#39;re not blown away.	1
soy and garlic fried chicken heaven. i personally like the legs better than the wings but to each her own, right?my fave part, oddly, is the pickled radish on the side. the radishes are refreshing and finely balance out the fried chicken.thumbs up! full review along with other stops made at a recent Koreatown food tour on my site.	1
Here for business lunch. Great atmosphere and food.	1
Lobster grilled cheese!!!	1
Beet Salad. Wow.	1
Last night or should I say this morning at 1am , I'd just finished working. I was starving and had to have something tasty. In search of a close 24hr spot.... My husband and I found "Fred 67". It was pretty busy... There were plenty of people who obviously shared my mission/idea. The vibe was great, service was perfect, the menu had a variety of choices & the food was delicious. I've added this little gem to one my favorite diners to frequent!	1
First visit was awesome but second visit was with a group and experience was horrible.<br><br>Pizza is amazing. <br>Service sucks. <br><br>Either they just want to have only locals come or they are straight up racist since we were the only diverse table in the place. There was another group who came after us yet were served right away. Im never coming here again. I live in NYC for a reason if I wanted to be treated that way I would move to the suburbs!	0
I checked out Perch with a few friends on a slow Thursday night and I must say I was quite impressed with the place. Getting to Perch is a journey in and of itself, you walk into the hotel, go down a hallway, up an elevator and out and around the corner into another elevator which drops you off at Perch's front door.Perch's interior is woody, dark, old style Chicago looking and their servers dress the part too in penguin style outfits. I didn't have the food but the drinks are pretty stiff and fairly cleverly named and moderately priced... but the service has a lot to be desired.All in all I think Perch is worth checking out, it has a classy interior, nice drinks and a very upscale but mellow crowd.	1
I'm not sure if it's the best fried chicken in the world but it is the best I have ever had and without doubt the best in Seattle! Both the regular and spicy are excellent. The pieces of chicken are huge! Where do they get the chickens?	1
My wife and I always enjoy dining at this restaurant.  Food is great and the service is exceptional.	1
I like the modern take of a burger joint. I was very impressed with the environment as it was packed with urbanites. It was a treat to eat a great burger considering I do not eat meat very much. The best thing about this place is the ability to choose what you can put on your burger. Of course you pay a premium for this ability, but the smallest burger (1/3 lb cooked) is still ample to eat. I think it was 8.95 before tax. Also, we decided to order some beers. They had some pretty good variety of beer and an interesting looking bar. However, the beer will set you back 6 bucks. I noticed that they had a happy hour. We had just missed happy hour, but I think that it would be nice to entertain happy hour at this place. Don't forget to get your parking ticket validated.	1
To be honest, this place is just ok. First time we came, hubby had to send back his eggs benedict twice. First the egg whites were runny, like way too runny. Then they were completely cooked through. They finally got the eggs right on the third try but the rest of the plate was stone cold. Didn't want to send it back so hubby ate what he could. I had corned beef hash. Nothing special. Waiter was totally snobby. Could tell he was exasperated with us. He should of directed it to his his kitchen staff. We returned a couple months later (we live close enough to give a second chance). The food was better. We both got the meatlover's scramble. Very enjoyable. But the service! We got the same snooty waiter. He really needs some training in the customer service department.	0
This place is so pretty! I love the concept, love their food (my fav shrimp po'boy) and love their cocktails infused w/ vegetables and fruits! Definitely a date place, Iv'e been here for dinner but I'm sure it's equally pretty during the day for brunch which I'm planning to do soon! Btw don't be turned off by the club/restaurant called POT on the ground level (very loud and cheap looking spot) that being said just go straight to the elevator quick and hit 2nd floor to get to the Commissary as pretty-ness awaits!	1
Went to Marty Markowitz&#39; &#34;State of the Borough&#34; address with a friend that I always drag to vegan places I want to try. Figured this spot was close and well-fitting with the nationalistic (boroughlistic) theme of the night. We shared the chickpea nuggets, Iron Man MOB and tapioca dessert.<br>Breakdown:<br>Nuggets were bland and dipping sauce was just mustard<br>Iron Man was an undercooked flatbread with vegan mayo and steamed kale with a few undercooked shitakes tossed on top<br>Tapoica was good but the sugar cookie in it was stale and soggy.<br>The service was good but my friend has a severe nut allergy and when I asked which desserts we could have, the server recommended a cheesecake made with cashews.<br>The atmosphere gets the stars.	0
So I only been here once. Its a whole in the wall bar/restaurant. Great for a date night or just chillin wit friends. I went on a date here and it was romantic with the lights and the fact that its outside with the night sky above u. But it doesn&#39;t really feel like your actually outside because you are between 2 brick buildings. Hard to explain idk lol. I&#39;m not big on beer but I got there cherry beer and it was sooo good. I will be back :)	1
I ate here for a friend&#39;s birthday about a year ago. <br><br>My first thought is, &#34;I can barely remember the meal.&#34; <br><br>&#34;But William,&#34; you might be thinking, &#34;how can you expect to remember a meal you had a year ago?&#34; <br><br>Stop reading right now. Just stop. I don&#39;t want you here. <br><br>Meals can be just as memorable as a first kiss. In fact, if you read some of my other reviews, you&#39;ll find that I&#39;ve reviewed a restaurant long after eating there and can still remember the toothy smile of a beautiful hostess. <br><br>This place really offered nothing. I really don&#39;t know why I gave it two stars. In fact, I&#39;m downgrading it to one right now. <br><br>There. Done. <br><br>The meal was bland. I think I had some sort of pasta and chicken parmesan type deal that was really no better than the stuff you find in the frozen food section at a supermarket. Stouffer&#39;s or whatnot. <br><br>This place relies totally on location and that kind of douchey Miami feel that a restaurants can sometimes have. The location? Right on Miami Ave. in the heart of Brickell. The douchey feel? That kind of half-club/half-restaurant deal where it&#39;s too dark to see your fork coming at your face. <br><br>The people were nice, I guess. I don&#39;t know. <br><br>It just seems to me like the owners spent a really long time on putting together the decor and just threw together a menu at the last minute. <br><br>But that&#39;s just me. What do I know, right? <br><br>The night&#39;s saving grace was ending up at Brickell Irish Pub afterward and dousing my redheaded stepchild of a meal with Dewar&#39;s and Smithwick&#39;s.	0
Very good thai food and service. It won&#39;t disappoint. I ordered the steamed pork dumplings and the chicken pad se ew. Both were very fresh	1
Pro:Seafood!!! Cheap valet ($2)Con:Portion is not as bis as you would expect in ktown.Place is kind of small. Go in a small group to avoid looooong wait.	1
Location, location, location.<br><br>Were it not for those 3 words, this place would be rated no higher than 2 or 3 stars. I can understand how people like it for the reasonable prices, but I&#39;d rather pay 30% more for food thats significantly better than this.<br><br>Tried the macaroni with sausage, tasted like boxed macaroni with pasta sauce in a jar topped off with an extremely porky tasting sausage. Having skipped lunch I was starving at dinner, but could not get myself to finish this plate.<br><br>Friend ordered the seafood linguine, looked great, except it has no flavor whatsoever. How do you get seafood to taste like nothing is beyond me.<br><br>If this place was on the UWS or in midtown, it would have shut down by now. Funny how people are so easily influenced by the location of a restaurant.<br><br>If you want similar prices, same ambience and 100 times better food, I suggest you check out Celeste on the UWS. If you must eat in Soho, goto Rubirosa which has hand made pasta&#39;s for only a little more.	0
Me and my boyfriend literally ordered this just last night. (As delivery, this item arrived in expected fashion, but the care + packaging we&#39;re pretty great for an order less than $15.)<br>.<br>We ordered &#39;The Falafel Burger&#39;, which is INSANELY delicious. For any vegetarians out there, this is a #MustHave....seriously. We ordered 2 of them (nothing else from the menu, since we don&#39;t divulge into many greasy items). But the combination of flavors was truly unique..and almost inspiring for any vegetarian/vegan cooks out there. And their menu almost has a stoner/drunchies (that&#39;s drunk + munchies, ppl) foodie combination. So for late evening cravings, try this place!<br><br>In either way, this delivery was overall pretty great---can&#39;t complain on timely delivered food that was professionally packaged + tasted delicious.<br><br>Loved It.	1
You should read my previous review, but I mainly based my previous one on the quality of the single slice I had at the time, which was really good.<br><br>Ordering a whole pie is *glorious*. The pastas are also all super fresh and I absolutely love his homemade meatballs. I am here constantly and my opinion of the place only gets better as I try more things on the menu. Check this place out -- you owe it to yourself to do it.	1
We have been here one other time, and enjoyed it so much we returned. The food is amazing--we had the crab salad, steak flatbread, cheese plate, salmon wellington, and shrimp skewers. The food came out appropriately timed, hot or cold as it needed, and our server was perfect. He anticipated our needs but was never intrusive. Their prices on the wines are very fair and allows us to try ones we normally would not.	0
The Lemongrass Beef Banh Mi is delicious. So many flavors, just the right portion. Loved it. Will be back here for sure. Thanks Lil Mo.	1
Service was great for a fast casual spot. The food did the job but I don&#39;t recommend the ground beef. <br><br>- TPK	1
I don&#39;t know why the reviews are so great for this place. The food is &#34;ok&#34; and the only table they have is almost never available because the owners always have their paperwork spread across it and are using it.	0
So we showed up on a quiet Tuesday evening and had a quiet dinner with our son.  The service was attentive and the food was very good.  The pasta was fresh and had a toothsome quality that indicative of it being freshly made, but I did find the food a tad on the salty side.  The charcuterie plate was a bit uninspired on the cheese front - classic, but the salt level kind of blew out my palette for part of the meal.  The pasta sauces (we got the spaghetti and the handkerchief) were a little bland, but my pork chop, however, was phenomenal.	1
Fantastic food! Try the Nacho appetizers! Delicious! Very friendly staff. All the dishes were tssty'	1
I came here 3 out of the 5 weekdays last week.. I guess that is saying something.. Love the different vendors and great food. I got the lobster rolls at Red Hook, both the Conn. and Maine one. Definitely love the Maine lobster roll a lot. I also got their mac and cheese which was also divine! I also got the strawberry basil lemonade from Frittering away. Very refreshing and tasted great. Then, I also got the pork and chicken taco from that korean fusion taco place. It was great but quite heavy. And of course got my sweets in from Billy&#39;s Bakery. Lines moved fast, seating is by chance, some/most of the vendors do take card, and food is fresh! Great place to change up your daily salad lunches. Prices are a bit high but what you expect....food vendors in nyc.	1
I forgot what he happy hour deal was but it was pretty good deal. I was in a hurry for a quick bite. I ordered the yellowtail lover and dang was it good. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Service was great too. I wanna go back during happy hour with more peeps so we can just gorge on a meal.	1
All in all, a great time. Our waitress was very attentive and helpful in describing the make up of many of the dishes and while the meal was on going.We would definitely book another visit.	1
Came here only for brunch; the menu was promising but it definitely fell short of expectations. The truffle fries were over fried; the ingredients for the omelette had salivating while waiting for it, but was personally not impressed. The staff was friendly, they offered Blue Bottle coffee, and the space itself was pretty cool; I may need to try the dinner here again based on the many positive reviews.	0
Cool vibe creative menu poorly executed spotlights spotlight the dust below average service. Food was over cooked taste of food masked by sauce or breading. Would go back only for drinks.	0
What a great spot :) Awesome craft beers and yummy food. Nice atmosphere with fun, attentive staff. Brenda was a great server with thorough knowledge of their offerings. The manager, Jeff, has an expansive knowledge and personal love for specialty beers and we had a great time chatting it up. Can&#39;t wait to go back!	1
Over Hyped.<br>I came here and waited in line for 30 minutes for a slice of greasy, flavorless pizza. I&#39;m a pizza love and there is nothing bette rthsn a great slice after a night out. Honestly, I would have been happier with a slice from domino&#39;s (barf). It might have been good when it was actually &#34;hidden&#34; but definitely isn&#39;t up to par now that the secret is out.	0
Foodgasmic!!! They&#39;re brunch was the best brunch I&#39;ve ever had, seriously! From the simple yet refreshing mimosa, to the mini biscuits and cinnamon roll, all the way down to a devoured baked egg skillet... I was thoroughly impressed. Thank you!	1
Could be a cool spot in heart of Japan Town Plaza, BUT lame service- lack of any graciousness, can't be bothered to stop as talking to me, never checked up on- Ok sushi not great...why do people think these sushi places are any good here in LA?	0
heck yeah.	1
After ALL the talk about fried chicken in the reviews... it was... how do I put it... just fried chicken. Nothing more, much less. It&#39;s the kind of fried chicken that is dry, and worth no more than $5. The grits that accompanied the fried chicken was beyond subpar, and honestly I could have just gone for KFC. At least KFC is much cheaper than $19 for TWO, that&#39;s right, only TWO pieces of chicken. <br><br>The only reason I&#39;m giving it two stars rather than one is because the service was good. I look for memorable food to eat and enjoy though, and this was far from memorable. I will probably forget about writing this review upon publishing it.	0
My date and I really really enjoyed this place last night. First, the DJ was awesome -- legit turntable DJ who seemed to be playing exclusively James Brown for a while which is hard to argue with. <br><br>The bartenders were all-around great. We didn&#39;t really know what we were in the mood for but our guy steered us into some tasty libations (and even adjusted my date&#39;s drink to her liking)<br><br>I&#39;m diggin the vibe. A little older (late 20s, early 30s) but if I&#39;m ever back in the neighborhood I&#39;ll definitely return.	1
All that hype about Kush and for what? If you can&#39;t cook a burger to temp move away from the grill! If you can&#39;t cook fries or bacon without burning them, start reconsidering your line of work because you don&#39;t belong behind the line! And if you undercook waffles, get the fu&#39; out of that kitchen! Sadly I won&#39;t be coming back, not worth the price or the &#34;whatever I don&#39;t care&#34; service/attitude.	0
We ate here once and have affectionately referred to it as &#34;Hurl of sandwich&#34; since. Enough said. Yikes...	0
Ashley was a superb waitress, attending to all our request. All service and good was great! Give it 10 stars if I could.	1
Very disappointed in the food. The menu was enticing but food was below average. Here are some notes:Chicharrons-very hard to chew. Almost broke a tooth.Duck Fat Beans and Rice- good concept but it was sticky, bland, no flavor at all.Sangria- below averageComfort- None. Cold, dark and dreary, kind of like prison would feel (I can only imagine)Service-not badShort Rib taco- most decent thing I ate. Not bad.Overall- 2 Stars for not too bad of service and innovative menu. But it was my first and definitely last visit to Diablo Taco.	0
My boyfriend took me there after seeing FB reviews. Honestly, I was disappointed... Only good thing about this place is great ambiance!!!I am giving only 1 star because of service and food. First of all, the service staff took forever to take our order. She forgot to bring us bread and drinks. Then, she put in wrong order which she had to come back to ask us what did we order... Big disappointment!!!!!All dishes we ordered were blend... No flavor.... Definitely not going back...	0
I keep coming back here for hope that I&#39;ll like it better, but I keep getting disappointed. The prices here are deceptive, because while in Chinatown a noodle shop may have similar prices, they don&#39;t usually charge tax. The midtown location charges tax, so that a plate of noodles plus a burger will easily go over $10 (unlikely in Chinatown). However, this is understandable given the location, and I would gladly forgive them if the food was good.<br><br>Unfortunately, the food isn&#39;t super amazing. The portions are actually a bit small. I only got a few pieces of oxtail in my oxtail soup, and the rest was just a ton of noodles. The lamb burger was pretty decent (though I couldn&#39;t eat it all because it was too spicy), but the pork burger was quite bad (the meat was dry and the bun was dry as well).<br><br>I actually think I liked this place better in my first visit since I was more forgiving - but coming here a second time just solidified my general ambivalence for the shop.	0
Crappy restaurant, really rude and completely unhelpful staff, sub par food. Had ordered a few times and thought he food was 'ok' but tolerable. Went to pick up food and was completely turned off and will never go there again. Wish I could have my money back.	0
What a bootleg version of Chipotle! I don&#39;t even like Chipotle but this place was modeled after it but it&#39;s just a horrible version. So for $14.75 I got 2 tacos (chicken and pork), chips and guac, and a bottle of root beer. The carnitas (pork) was dry! How do you dry out pork! If I wanted jerky I would&#39;ve had a slim jim! The chicken was burnt (similar to Chipotle so I don&#39;t even know why I got it) then instead of normal shredded cheese there was some sliced cheese that was placed on the tortilla before they put the meat on. The guac was ok and the chips were stale. This place is tiny so finding a seat can be a problem or you&#39;ll end up dining with a stranger Starbuck&#39;s style. I would&#39;nt have even commented on it if the food was good but since it wasn&#39;t might as well throw all the punches at once. The one good thing was that the taco didn&#39;t fall apart like lots of tacos tend to do. Won&#39;t be coming back here.	0
Good food. Recommend the sweet and spicy chicken. Service was a little slow but I'm assuming it is because they were making it all fresh. So just be prepared to wait 15-20 minutes for the food to come out.	1
I don&#39;t get why people rave about this place. I mean I&#39;m sure you&#39;re happy to be in Vegas and you&#39;re probably having fun, but k&#39;mon, you still gotta be fair to the food you&#39;re rating...<br><br>I came here once. My friend was pretty excited to try this place out during this trip. I got the Bobbie, which is a very big Thanksgiving leftover sandwich. <br><br>I don&#39;t know about you but it makes no sense to me to put stuffing in a sandwich. It&#39;s just starch on starch and makes the sandwich unnecessarily heavy. The flavor of the stuffing doesn&#39;t bring much to the table either. <br><br>My whole sandwich came to me cold. EVEN THE BREAD WAS COLD! I suspect they premade my sandwich and just pulled it out of the fridge when we ordered. Why would any sandwich shop serve refrigerator temperature bread???<br><br>I guess if you work and live in Vegas this might be an OK lunch spot, but if you come from out of town, there are much better places to spend your appetite. Don&#39;t waste a meal here!	0
Stick to the ceviche.<br>Sangria was good. Service was ok. <br>It is loud in here so take note of that. <br>I picked the Churrasco. Bad choice. I asked for medium rare and it came out super dry and without much flavor. Def stick to the ceviches. Those are good.	0
Food is ok not that amazing but service is bad!!! Our server (guy) kept ignoring us when this group came in and when we asked him for something he came back after 20 mins letting us know that there out. it's a shame we went there for my friend 's bday. Defintely not coming back	0
Excellent bandeja paisa. Everything on it is great... Hard to find asking Colombian restaurants. Staff is very, very friendly and the restaurant has a cozy, authentic feel. Been back several times and quality is consistent.	1
Not so great brunch. Bloody Mary taste like pickles and relish. Ricotta pancakes were too dry, cake-y, doughy. I&#39;ve made better ricotta pancakes at home from watching Ina Garten on Food Network. If I ate seafood, I would have ordered the mussels since my friend is thoroughly enjoying himself eating his brunch right now while I sit here unsatisfied and hungry. Would not come back, not even for the drinks. Rightfully at 2-3 stars in my opinion.	0
Fred 62 has an updated menu, y'all! It's actually pretty great. I'm a fan of how they do the Thai Cobb salad in particular. That said - diner with a twist. Very LA. Food is consistent, though, and I'll say that's definitely to its benefit - whether I'm craving a shake or a burger or want something slightly healthier to satisfy, Fred 62 is a great place to stop by. Parking can be tough if you're doing brunch late on the weekends, though, so definitely keep that in mind and aim for an earlier time if you come on the weekend. Otherwise it's consistently fast and the food is solid. Definitely worth trying out the new menu, too!	1
co-workers took me here and I gotta say it kicks butt. It&#39;s like a neighborhood criola joint. Roast pork, beef steak, oxtail, plantains, beans, etc. You basically get a mound of food for not too much $. And they don&#39;t give you attitude either! I especially like how the menu on the wall has things like burgers and pizza on it. Has anyone tried to order burgers here? I wouldn&#39;t.	1
The only Thing that prevents me from giving Crush a 5 is the fact that we really didn't order much food so we can't properly rate their food and their prices.  They are slightly more expensive than other wine bars in the area.  That said, we will definitely visit them again.  Their staff is extremely friendly and helpful.  I recommend them.	0
We spent Thanksgiving in neighboring Oxford MD and enjoyed an exceptional Thanksgiving dinner at Stars. The atmosphere and views of the Miles River are unparalleled and the food and five star service are in keeping with a fine dining establishment. We thoroughly enjoyed the experience and can't wait to return.	0
The staff and our server met every request with a smile and exceeded our expectations &lt;3	1
We had great time and the owner is the nicest person i ever met. He spoiled us!<br>The food is so good and the hookah is great. The place is so nice and we feel so camfortable!<br>I am sure that we will be a lot here!	1
good price, good service and good food! the wait was long but maybe it was because it is a Saturday night. but the all-you-can eat is totally worth it!	1
Really, really, really don&#39;t get what the fuss is about here. Food was spectacularly greasy and heavy. Had a hard time finding anything we wanted to eat. Glorifying fat is lazy in my opinion. Work harder to coax great flavors and textures with less fat, please! Surely that&#39;s what a Top Chef should be able to do, yes?	0
Wonderful food and even better service from our waiter James.  Next time were back in Vegas, we are going back.  Salmon app was wonderful, lamp shank was delightful and the trout entre was amazing.  Everything was wonderfully presented and great wine recommendations from James made it a perfect experience.	1
Ok, this place is no Chipotle, however the lines are shorter. Having said that there&#39;s probably a good reason why the lines are shorter. <br><br>The place is open 24 hrs except on Sundays which reflects on their cleanliness. It has a strange smell of mildew and they&#39;re not very neat. <br><br>The food is o.k. I honestly wouldn&#39;t recommend it to anyone fearing I&#39;d lose my credibility. I was craving a burrito today and I know how long the lines are at chipotle, especially on the weekend so you can say I kinda settled for Ernesto&#39;s. <br><br>It&#39;s not the worst I&#39;ve had but you won&#39;t leave 100% satisfied. They do have a very delicious Horchata, which is hard to find in south Florida. (It&#39;s a rice based drink with cinnamon) <br><br>I guess you&#39;ll just have to try it, I don&#39;t want to be responsible for an unsatisfactory experience. I&#39;m not co-signing.	0
Took my mom and grandmother while they were in town. Food was disappointing and unremarkable despite sounding good -- no one out of the four of us had any desire to finish our meals and we had walked in hungry! IMPOSSIBLE to flag down our waiter for assistance (missing fork, water refill, etc). Won&#39;t waste my time or money here again.	0
No no and more no. Came here with a girlfriend and had a 3 course pre-fix 3 meal for lunch. My friend ordered a cocktail and it was NOT tasty. Do they try the drinks after the make them? They definitely should start.<br><br>The service was horrible (expected in Miami). Our server must have taken a nap in the back or something because after 10 minutes we didn&#39;t see her for the entire meal. We had to ask someone else to speed up our order as the first course took forever.<br><br>I had a soup to start and shrimp for my second course. The shrimp was so over cooked that I honestly could not even cut it in half. It was not edible. My friend was like &#34;oh it can&#39;t be that bad&#34; mmmmhmm then she attempted to cut it as well. Didn&#39;t happen. Sigh...on to dessert. The only decent part of the meal was dessert but it was not good enough to make up for the rest of the meal. <br><br>Definitely won&#39;t be back anytime soon.	0
My favorite Rooftop Bar in Downtown LA and possibly the entire world (for now).The view at the roof at night is breathtaking the first time you see it, and ditto for second, third, fourth, etc. It's about 15 floors up with Pershing Square and the more prominent Downtown office buildings and hotels visible with plenty of seating and gas-lit fire pits. I love the decor; while it is French inspired, it's also got very classic 50's-60's Downtown Los Angeles ambiance to it. All in all, the entire rooftop experience is surreal; it's really the perfect place to have a somewhat casual-classy night with friends.Drink prices are fair and the bartenders are always super nice and have a heavy pour. I like how they change up their craft beer selections from time to time. No Natty Ice here, bros.Food is decent, too. I especially love their burger and fries, among other things. Good luck getting seated here for dinner if you just walk-in, though. Reservations are a must unless you want to take your chances at the free-for-all seating at the lower-level bar.If you're coming here on a Friday or Saturday for the rooftop level, be sure to arrive by 9:30pm or expect a wait. Not only would you have to wait at the ground level, but once you take the elevator up to the "lower-level bar," there's another line to get to the top. I can see why this would piss off some of the other Yelpers here, but I understand why Perch does this. Without these measures, the top level would be overcrowded and ruin the experience. The second "line" usually isn't that bad, and it requires some cunning to get into at times, but it's worth it.Lastly, there's no cover charge here, which is a HUGE plus for such a classy establishment in Downtown LA.I'm in love with this place and I will definitely be back again and again.	1
This is a pretty cool little gem hidden in DTLA. They have a pretty good beer selection. Their food is good, but Ive been here more for the beer than the food.	1
The best crab place in Miami, the garlic and Maryland style Blue Crab our some of the best I had. Took some family that have never tried blue Crab and said it was the best crab they have ever had. We ordered a half dozen of the garlic and a half Maryland Style plus sides of parsley potatoes and garlic bread, add a slice of key lime pie and some drinks and we were amazed to walk out for $80. If you have never had Blue Crab or just looking for great seafood at a even better price this is the place to go. A true hidden gem in Miami...	1
worst bar ever..no parking..no servers..rude non locals inside who will try to hit or touch you in private areas..horrible service..door man instagates things causing a lot of fights. good food but not worth your life or night..not the best karaoke bar either just a copy of the one down the street.	0
this was a complete waste of money. I would have rather gone to Denny&#39;s. Never again. an the manager was nasty on the way out	0
I KNOW THERE ARE GOOD REVIEWS ON HERE BUT DON&#39;T BELIEVE THEM! TURN BACK, FELLOW TRAVELLER, AND SEEK SUSTENANCE AT ANOTHER OUTPOST.<br><br>Possibly the worst brunch I&#39;ve ever had, which is a shame because the staff is really nice... The problems -- the decor, the music and THE FOOD.<br><br>The place is pretty hideous inside, looking like it was designed by a hot topic shopper that sort of likes hip hop and mimosas. Add to that the house music blasting at noon for no reason. <br><br>But really, the star of the show was the absolutely mediocre-to-horrible food. Scrambled eggs that were dry and overcooked, potatoes that were so not crispy that they flopped over like sad little wet slugs, and pork belly that tasted like fish. Maybe the one good thing is the chicken and waffles, but who cares, especially when there&#39;s a full menu of practically inedible nonsense. I mean, they even burnt the toast on my BLT, and didn&#39;t butter the bread that came with the eggs.<br><br>Lackluster kitchen, crappy atmosphere, and a crowd full of nitwits who know no better. Unless they fire the entire cooking staff and replace the menu I will never return.	0
i like the diner feel of this place and the fact it s open 24 hrs dont hurt much either especially when its 3 in the mourning and i m high as shit and just wanting a good place to get some grub to satisfy the late night mounge attacks good breakfasts good lunch just plain fuckin good shit	1
I haven&#39;t tried their amazing Pastrami and Corned Beef... :( I promise I will next time I&#39;m on Fairfax, which is often. SO WILL UPDATE SOON!<br><br>Went to the Welcome to the Block party for the Crooks and Castles opening this past weekend slightly buzzed. Came across Canter&#39;s to use the restroom and saw a small dark room tucked away in the back. Very chill, old school (like for real old school) vibe... $5 shots! Juke box. Interesting heads in the mix. I dig it.	1
Really pricey American version of Korean food. Not as good as anything you&#39;ll find in ktown, yet probably a lot more expensive.<br><br>The lettuce wraps used for the ssam sets has a weird, unpleasant taste to it<br><br>If you&#39;re looking for good korean food, this is definitely not it.<br><br>That being said, the atmosphere is really nice. This is much more of a place for someone who&#39;s never had korean food before and wants to be eased in. Not recommended for korean food fans.	0
It's a bit out of my way than I would have liked, but that's something I can deal with.	0
My boyfriend was starving so I toke him to Bachi Burger and he ordered a hamburger medium well to go. He waits about 10mins and comes out with a to go bag and we hit the gas station then home. He opens the bag to find a sack of fries inside, no burger. Mind you fries don&#39;t come with their over priced burgers. So he calls them and requests a fresh burger to be cooked for him and we drove all the way back. Did they cook him a new burger? No! They tried to give him the same one that was now about 35 minutes old. So we waited again and refer to the pic to see that they gave him... the bun and the burger and that&#39;s it! No lettuce, tomato, no mayo, no nothing! Unfortunately they locked the door behind him because by this time it was 10pm so no way to get the rest of what he paid for. For sure going to contact the General Manager tomorrow for a refund because this experience was a complete joke! Not sure if we will ever trust them again.	0
I've been here so many times, it's a great spot for the atmosphere and usually the drinks. I love the mojito, it's refreshing and they do it well. I love coming here with friends, I've been at the bar, had a booth, and a tiny table. I want to try their fun little curtain booths. The food is good, they're always doing specials, sometimes half off everything, so the last time I came I took advantage and tried the burger. It was not bad, my friend ordered the tuna poke, it was a pleasant surprise. It reminds me of the one I love at the sushi place I like. Hanger steak is usually good, although when my friend ordered it, it looked half the size of the one I remember having. They've got good spicy bloody marys, and theres a TV near the bar for games. I love this spot for hanging out, it's nice a dimly lit, probably good for a date. Although the nights when they do their specials, it gets super crowded and they usually seem to cram more tables in.	1
Just been in there for dinner with my wife. She had the grilled cheese, I splurged on a truffle burger. The food was excellent - the burger was up there with the likes of DuMont. <br><br>Decor is a bit sparse, but this is a great place to go for some BBQ comfort food. I&#39;d definitely go back there!	1
We're a Best Citysearch Winner	1
Ordered the lobster roll... Was so tender and tasty!Bun melted in my mouth. My issue: was sooo tiny for $20. So don't come too hungry and you'll leave with a huge smile.Fries were A+ too.	1
All and all, Canal Street is a fine place to dine if you happen to be staying at Orleans. However, I wouldn't go out of my way again to eat there. Food was below average for fine dining, and server appeared stretched too thin. Additionally, the restaurant lacks a cocktail menu and the usual stockings for a full bar.	1
Delicious breakfast, welcoming attitudes, and easy on the wallet.	1
This was a repeat visit (6) to this wonderful restaurant.  The food is fabulous!  From Brands signature salad to their excellent desserts, it is a culinary experience.  The steaks are &quot;to die for&quot;.  The staff are friendly and well informed about all items on the menu.  I would recommend this establishment to anyone who wants a fine dining experience.	1
Wasn't too thrilled with this place. Walked in for a drink early Saturday afternoon, it wasn't busy and the service was kind of lame. We sat right at the bar and really had to get the bartenders attention. Like I said it wasn't busy. Maybe he was new. Not sure. But the dirty vodka martini wasn't great either.	0
The Mae Eun Galbi Jeem is Awesome.<br>Comes with a side of Dolsot Brown Rice, kimchi, and Spicy Radish.<br>No complaints regarding the quality of food.<br><br>The service wasn&#39;t up to par. two employees running around taking care of a a couple tables. Waited forever for more water, while my mouth was on fire.<br><br>Another thing is the parking in the back. There was a valet parking attendant who charges 2 dollars which is fine. Except for the fact that there were only 2 cars in a 50 car lot. I had to argue with the valet saying.. ill give you the two dollars let me park my own car.. etc... <br><br>The 4 stars once again is for the food quality as you can&#39;t go wrong eating here.	1
went there for their always amazing &#34;monday supper&#34;. Drove across town only to discover they were out of the nights offering. Bummer. We decided to stay any way and pay twice what we were expecting, but at the end of the dinner the hostess offered to buy us dessert. Impressive display of customer service that I rarely see anymore. Of course.. lol.. they forgot to actually deduct it from the bill forcing me awkwardly to say something, but an honest mistake. All in all, an excellent experience. Have never had a bad meal here and they really do what they do well.	1
Interesting and fun Korean food with a twist. Great location and great service - would come back again.	1
awesome place! love the bread with zatar ! and not forget like the new times said the BEST PITA BREAD IN MIAMI so true	1
Great restaurant.  The meatball appetizer was the best I have had anywhere.  My husband and I ordered the lamb dish, very tasty.  Our friends had the salmon, she loved it and he had the veal scallopini, he said it was perfect.  Great night and the decorations for Christmas are outstanding.  Cant wait for the outside bar to be open for dinner.	1
I have never had to wait more than 10 minutes here; perhaps I tend to go during the off hours.I really enjoy the food at toast each time - I like the chicken pesto panini and I really love the date shake! MMM... (I know...I know it's an acquired taste).	1
We were pleasantly surprised when we went to Mezcal in Leominster this week.  I had read some not so great reviews but took a chance and glad we did!  The food was excellent. The service was outstanding, and the atmosphere was very enjoyable.  The kids enjoyed $2 taco night (Tuesdays) and we had large portions and what I consider gourmet meals.  They were excellent and I'm looking forward to going back soon.	1
Probably my favorite spot for Korean BBQ in LA for all you can eat. Before this place I never thought the meat quality mattered, but it does. Apparently they use the same place as another expensive place in Koreatown but they just do an all you can eat menu.<br><br>How about the meat list is awesome. And there&#39;s tiers from the basic 12.99 to 16.99 to 25.99. All of them work. They also change the grill type depending on the meat, so service is awesome. It&#39;s kind of noisy but it has a unique flare about it. The meat quality is good and the side dishes include ddokbokki (spicy rice cake), sprouts, sweet potato noodles and more. Seriously one of the best ban chan varieties I&#39;ve ever had. The meat is great. Basically no wait. Also awesome job when they have kimchi rice for you that they mix together by shaking in a tin. Steamed egg here was delish. <br><br>Water is cold and delicious with my meat.	1
Very friendly to Non-Spanish speaking customers. Have the special of the day. I had the ropa vieja. It was AMAZING!	1
Pros:- Modern clean aesthetic- Friendly waitersCons:- This isn't an izakaya (japanese bar). It is a highly americanized japanese tapas place.- Dishes are overpriced.- No japanese beer on the menu (this is supposed to be a japanese bar after all)- Beer is expensive. Sake is served in small portions and is expensive.- Ambiance is just too upscale for a izakaya. This place lacks authenticity.- Something about not seeing a Sapporo beer special for cheap and a large house hot sake on the menu just takes the fun out of an Izakaya.- Trying to be more upscale than it should be for the food genre it's targeting. Basically the place just doesn't offer good value and the setting isn't as fun as a real izakaya. Food was average. Kind of a disapointment.	0
I ordered a special cold soba that supposedly have tomato, fried buckwheat, cucumbers and chickpeas. I should have ordered something else since that doesn&#39;t sound fulfilling at all but since it is a special I figured it can&#39;t be that bad. Hm. Wrong. Where was the tomato? I asked the chef and he goes, &#34;oh, we sold out of tomato.&#34; Um... <br>1. The cook should tell the customer that an ingredient is missing and should apologize, without having the customer question where is the missing ingredient <br>2. Putting something else in to compensate would be a nice gesture (or at least ask the patron would we like something else to replace the tomato) and finally... <br>3. It&#39;s a tomato, buy some down the block for chrissake! We arrived at 5:30pm, meaning they had plenty of time to buy the darn tomato during their break from 3-5pm. But nope, they were just either lazy or forgetful. Whoever is doing the stock check is doing a horrible job. <br><br>Small place so be prepared to have your bowl taken away in a flash and the check presented to you in a jiffy. And since it&#39;s small you can imagine how small the restroom is. Super tiny. The only saving grace is the soba. <br><br>Note: hot as hell in there since there is no air conditioning so wear light if you plan on eating here	0
The burgers are fabulous and the women who run the place were so nice. On a random Sunday afternoon the place was packed. The beer list was a beer drinkers dream and music was awesome.	1
Delish! Fun and yummy grilled cheese sandwiches that come with a shot of tomato soup...what's not to love? And bonus, it's a food truck.	0
LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! There is not one bad thing I can say. If you like your hot sauce really spicy ask Dave for the extra spicy sauce. He doesn&#39;t put it out unless you ask for it. The garlic pork is my favorite!	1

This restaurant satisfying my appetite right away as I missing some Korean soup so badly because the weather is gloomy with the low sky, foggy, and the chill air making goose bump all over me. <br><br>I had a lunch with my son-in-law. We both ordered the pork neck soup. Contained in the stone pot, the soup and the steamed rice coming, sizzling. The soup was as hot as i got a blister in my mouth as i tasted the first spoon. The portion was huge. Scrumptious. Ultimately fermented Kimchi. What else have i needed? Nothing more than that. <br><br>Staffs are kind. Parking in rear is spacious. The restaurant is 24/7. The price is affordable.	1
The house made ricotta and fig and honey dish was pure goodness. Oysters were good.I had the steamed mussels which was very flavorful and yummy but I wish I would have ordered the burger. It looked really yummy (my friend ordered it and said it was very good).	1
Waiting for 10 mins for the server to come in, ordered a soup with a an entree waiting for 15 mins the ready made soup is not serve, we cancelled the soup coz I think they r planning to serve it after our meal	0
Came here for the first time suited up for STARSKEE's 21st BDay. The whole squad came out to play, and for such a small, narrow joint, we packed that piece like no tomorrow. Funny thing was our super cute waitress, had mentioned she was a Star Wars Fanatic, and i was like, "Ughhhhh.... WEAK." but my boys were like, "OH YEAHHHHH...!"Guess which of the homies STRUCK OUT?!!!!But yeah, this place is bomb. The burgers are tasty, the beers are cheap, and they have Jameson shots on deck! BOOMI think its Friday nights, or Thursday nights that have a live performances. Which is cool.... but i prefer the quiter nights to be able to hear your buddies. Oh... and our Bros at National Film Society frequent this place. We've seen Patrick there multiple times..! STAAAAAAAAAR STRUCKKKKKKKKKK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	1
Morning, noon, night, or coming from the club(my Favorite), this spot is like going to grandmas house. Some restaurants say Location, location, location. The Pantry says Portion, portions, porrrrrtttionssss. <br><br>Don&#39;t go thinking you&#39;re gonna get a small meal. This is grandmas spread without the love. Okay, maybe a little love. <br><br>So what the service isn&#39;t 5 Star, it&#39;s not a 1 star so don&#39;t let service be a meal breaker. The food is all that and a Costco sized bag of chips. <br><br>I&#39;m lame because I always get the same thing everytime I go. Pancakes, potatoes and bacon. here let me break this down for you.<br><br>3 Jumbo pancakes<br>5 Pieces of bacon<br>and I&#39;m guessing at least a potatoe and a half. <br><br>Mmmhhhhmmmm, who needs change with all of that staring up at you. <br><br>oh and I almost forgot, the Toast. I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s at least a half loaf.<br><br>So if you roll up to the pantry one day and see the line outside to get in. Just do it!	1
My girlfriend and I hunted this warm, stylish bistro down on a recent visit to Seattle because I read about their oyster happy hour on Yelp. Everything about our experience at Zoeb was outstanding. First, we ordered sixteen Shigoku oysters, and not only were these rare deep-shelled bivalves amazing, our server also threw in two extra oysters on the house. Second, Zoeb has both a great wine and beer list. I find that many restaurants tend to favour one beverage over the other, and it seems like places that serve oysters are wine biased, but Zoeb has great crafts on tap too. Third, our server was amazing. He was attentive, very polite, and quick to refill our plates with Zoeb's delectable complimentary focaccia when they began to look bare. I want to explore the Capitol Hill area more thoroughly on my next visit, and I will be sure to drop by Zoeb during my wanderings.	0
I just hate when places / hosts make me feel like shit for rolling solo. Sorry cant have food until you&#39;re with someone. Not acceptable.	0
This place used to be great, but the quality has really taken a nosedive over the past 6 months or so. I think they lost their chef (you can see the people cooking--it&#39;s an open kitchen--and he is never there anymore), and the owner seems to have taken over the cooking. Not a wise decision. The menu is limited, which is fine, but it DOES NOT change, ever! There used to be at least 2 specials, but they only do one now. Portions are small, too. It&#39;s sad, because this used to be my favorite place in the area. But the last 3 times have been awful. And why don&#39;t they do tap beer? They have room. Why would I pay 6 bucks for a Guinness in a can when I can get a real one right next door?	0
I always confuse Bangkok Bangkok with Rock a Bangkok, anyways after eating out at Bangkok Bangkok i saw through Yelp of course that there was another Thai restaurant down the street (this one of course). First and foremost the restaurant is not big so don&#39;t expect a TGIF type of restaurant, it&#39;s small and simple and very quiet which is good. Second the Thai lady that was there is super duper nice &amp; sweet, she was very attentive from the moment we walked in till the moment we left. The food to be honest with you I don&#39;t really see a difference between Bangkok Bangkok and this place (duh obviously) they&#39;re both Thai, but I figured each restaurant is different and have there own style. Over all this is really good place, the customer service is exceptional, and the food is really good. Definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants to try something other than the type restaurants we eat.	1
This is one of my favorite spots when I am craving a burger, if I'm in the area! I've been to Madison 3 times for work and I always make a stop at the Graze for the Graze Burger - $22. The patty is always moist and flavorful. The side of fries is also great with the aioli sauce. With a few glasses of beer, it will leave your tummy smiling. They have happy hour where you get a buy one, get one off their beer selection. I tried a few, but my favorite beer there is the Potosi Snake Hollow. When I was at the bar, I was told that the chef also works at the L'Etoile restaurant which is very high end. So expect the Graze to have that top quality food for reasonable prices. The service is amazing! They make be slower during rush hour, but when they do stop by, they are always very friendly. When I hear that my coworkers are heading to Madison for work, I always recommend a stop at the Graze for dinner! The next time I am at Madison, I'll be sure to stop by again!	1
We code the restaurant for convenience while staying at the Renaissance are were nicely surprised by the creative menu, food quality and overall experience. The salmon and pastas were great choices from both a portion and quality standpoint. Homemade pasta, terrific sauce, and nice sides that wete fairly priced. Service was quick and efficient. Staying 3 more nights and will probably make a return visit, even with so many other great choices nearby.	1
Definitely not known for their service. Very grumpy servers slinging mediocre food. Literally slinging... Attitude.<br>Love the ambience.	0
The food is always delicious especially if Pico sour is added to your dinner. The only downer was A fix up menu for Valentine's Day. Please next time let the customer decide how much of how little we want to eat.	1
Wow the view is amazing! We arrived Saturday morning and got a table for two without a reservation. The food was a hit and a miss...the French toast was AMAZING crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside! Eggs Benedict was a B+. But the truffle fries were greasy and we couldn&#39;t taste the truffle. So sad. The service was eeeeh... My friend actually found a 2 inch stick with sharp thorns mixed in with her blackberries on top of the French toast. It was pretty scary looking. She told our waiter that she wasn&#39;t complaining, but just wanted to let him know that there might be more in the berry basket and to have the chef keep and eye out for them. I was thinking that they would offer her a different plate or take a percentage off, but nope. Odd. In the end the food was good minus the thorns, the view was amazing and the service could use some improvements.	1
Not impressed. Food was just OK and there weren't a ton of options on the menu. the ingredients were just so-so and they didn't taste super fresh. We ordered fried pickles and reg/sweet potato fries for the table, i tried a few of them. Fries were okay, fried pickles were good, but there were about 4 pieces in each order. Service was pretty bad.No intention of coming back, especially with the amount of highly rated burger places in LA.	0
Uni pasta was not creamy...more milky and watery....milk might of been a bit sour too. I personally like Ish Kitchen more.<br><br>Salad was also not fresh...melting bits...<br><br>Got pretty sick that night<br><br>Wouldnt be my choice to go back	0
List is great!	1
I wish I could give this place the no star rating that it deserves. I&#39;ve eaten here a handful of times before and it was ok, to say the least. Food is a below average, it&#39;s not even hot when they bring it out to you sometimes. But the reason for this shitty review is because I order the pork chops last night and it was served to me RAW!!!! And after I finally found the waiter to let him know, showed him the pink pork that I was suppose to eat, he says to me &#34;Oh yeah, that is raw, do you want me to have them cook it more?&#34; SERIOUS?? Are you f-ing serious? To top it off, there was no apologizes whatsoever. I will not be returning here again, ever.	0
We celebrated my daughters 19th birthday and it was wonderful. I had her graduation celebration at the other location in Vegas and it could't have been more perfect. Very nice staff and the food is the best. Love Brio. We are originally from Los Angeles and we just found out they now have two location out there. Thank you Brio for your warmth and great food.	1
The restaurant was recommended to us by a friend. We were celebrating a birthday and had a great time. The food was better than expected but the wine not so good. However, we combined the red and white to make our own rose and it was good.	1
I can&#39;t stand places that serve beer like it&#39;s a religion and have TVs and high stools and a clientele of puffy people. <br><br>But I went here to meet someone who picked the spot (because he said they have the best selection of beer, of course). With very low expectations I ended up having the best Caprese sandwich in town and an overall nice experience due in part to the very nice staff. When I wanted espresso (yes, I like espresso, not beer), the waiter said I could run across the small street and get it from Cafecito Organico and feel free to bring it in. <br><br>I will go back for sure, even despite the pub atmosphere that is not my taste.	1
The best place to take a break at the LACMA museum.Food and service are good.Enjoy the ambience and the place.	1
THE LOWDOWN==- Possibly the most popular hidden spot in Little Tokyo.<br><br>Friday bar hopping night, but ended up getting food after being hypnotized by other people&#39;s orders. The average sized bar area was not able to handle all the patrons. It was crowded beyond belief in that small room, about 3 deep. Funny though is that I don&#39;t remember it being muggy at all so kudos to that. Since it was so crowded at the bar, my group ended up taking a table outside, where we were serenaded by fun 80 90&#39;s hip hop. The waitresses were pretty busy running back and forth on this crowded night, but we got immediate service when we flagged for it. Burgers and fries clock in at under 10 bucks which is freaking amazing given the amount and quality of the food here.<br><br>-=- BLAT Burger -=- Bacon Lettuce Avocado Tomato. The BLAT Burger was bomb-diggity. Thick bun and tasty med rare meat. Bacon was thick cut with a maple-ish glaze. Avocado was thick cut as well and was equally dispersed in every bite. My burger came out cold, which was a bummer, but I&#39;ll be back anyway.<br><br>-=- Wasabi Fries -=- It&#39;s actually regular cut fries with a wasabi ranch dip. INTENSE wasabi ranch dip. Most would not be able to handle this, but to some of us champs, I was impressed by the preserved flavor of the dip through the wasabi kick.<br><br>-=- Expresso Stout -=- It was by a Japanese brewer, I think, from all the Japanese writing on it. It was sooo good that I had 2 of the same. It&#39;s thick and a bit sweet, but it&#39;s perfect for those looking for a filling beer without the bitter beer taste.<br><br>Again: under 10 bucks for burgers+fries, awesome ambiance, fun crowd, food open till 1am. WIN!	1
As much as I like the rooftop and the food service sucks!!!!If u plan a large reservation the menu is fixed and the options are not anything appetizing ! The food is great here if your party is 2. Any group larger than 2 wanting to dine and drink don't waste ur time or money!This place needs help with reservations and menu selections. Such a shame. Wish I could give it a better rating but customer. Service is FIRST because after all without customers you wouldn't have a business.	0
Okay Miami, as I&#39;ve been told this is where Waxy On the River used to be. I must say that the location is spectacular, but the food is not great at all. I went on Valentine&#39;s Day with a group of 6 and it was not packed---now I know why. The menu is very selective and when I finally received my &#34;chicken over a brick&#34; it literally tasted like a brick. The chicken was so dry. The waitress was not great either. She forgot our drinks and she seemed pretty new at being a waitress.	0
Really enjoyed this restaurant. It has an awkward open layout, but I'm slowly discovering that most restaurants on state street do. I guess it's just dat college vibe! Food was good, satisfying and at a decent price. Went for dinner and what I really wanna do is go back for the lunch buffet to try EVERYTHING!!	0
This was a good place actually the third time i&#39;ve been here ....the only reason i gave it a 4 start is that the prices were kinda high....13 for philidelphia roll?!? buy the food was good.. the service was prompt, and i guess if you factor in its in the a prominent plaza it compensates for the cost... i guess	1
Heavy greasy & WAY overpriced (even for Bainbridge)! Over a couple times we've tried chili relleno (yuck!!) crazy ceasar (soaked in dressing & loaded with heavy meat) smoked chicken enchilada (yuck!) fish taco special (sub par) chicken tacos (okay) chimichanga (good but really heavy/rich). Just very unauthentic-canned & processed & plopped on a plate 	0
Snug little spot with great French-ish tapas. Good for sharing with a small group. Gets noisy, but feels festive. Very good service. Would definitely return to try rest of the menu. <br><br>We had (and enjoyed):<br>Stuffed octopus (or was it squid?)<br>Eggplant thing (stuffed, I think)<br>Bean sprout salad <br>Fava beans thing with pickled veggies<br>Pork cheek<br>Veal<br>Chocolate and citroen tarts<br><br>Was recovering, so no wine :)	1
Everything about our experience at the restaurant and hotel was great!  Staff were attentive - the food was excellent and plentiful - the price reasonable.  Great place to dine, drink and be merry!	0
Eh.. The food here is not so great. I prefer thai food that has that authentic taste and is not too greasy. I ordered a pad see wu to go and I waited 50 minutes... Although their servers were really nice about it, i&#39;ll probably never come back	0
Dined in Florian Cafe for brunch. Service was a little slow at first considering there were many open tables, but picked up throughout our meal. All of the bottomless drinks they offer are delicious. We shared the lasagna ossobucco which was awesome! Everyone at our table ordered a brunch item (frittata,eggs benedict,...) which all were good, but nothing out of the ordinary. Would defiantly come back here again to try the other items on the menu.	1
Well. It was okay.	1
Really cool concept and great presentation but food was okay. Portions are giant though.The boneless ribeye was nothing special .. Cooked perfectly but lacked in seasoning along with the sauce it came with. The lobster poptarts were delicious, didn't even use the sauce because it was so good. And so was the lobster mac and cheese .. Definitely prefer it over the regular one.The short rib was cooked perfectly but lacked in flavor. Drinks were awesome. Martinis definitely recommended. Got the Marie Antoinette head for dessert. More fun to look at than to eat. Also since it's in season, you can add shaved white alba truffles to any order .. $25 for 2.5 grams.	0
The front-of-house service was great. The food, not so much. The vegetarian special of the day sounded great so I ordered it, house made pasta with truffles, ricotta, lemon. Tasted like unsalted buttered noodles that I could make at home, there were hints of the ricotta and lemon. The truffles were rather disturbing, chewy bits of something that had once been a living plant, but that was a long time ago. My husband ordered the daily steak special that the menu seemed to indicate would cost $28, actual price was$42. It was decent, but not $42 good. My very plain pasta was $36 ($36!). With two drinks, the bill came to about $92. With these prices, I expect at least a little bit of amazingness with the food. It wasn't there at all.	0
Came here for DineLA week for dinner. We got there just in time with all the traffic and scored a free parking spot on the street (after 7pm). If not, they also have valet. We got a cute little booth against the front window and the waitress was very friendly and helpful with her suggestions. I went with the goat cheese fondue and the pork cutlet with potatoes and fennel sauce on top? For dessert I had the fried apple pie with the carmel and vanilla ice cream. Everything was delicious and fresh! Everyone was very attentive at the restaurant. We really enjoyed DineLA, we got a 3 course meal for $25 and the food was delicious. I would definitely recommend the &#34;make your own s&#39;more&#34; dessert my gf had a ball with that and they make their graham crackers! <br>I would definitely come back here to try additional items. Thanks!	1
Yummy. Good veggie-friendly place near the airport. I stopped in briefly for some hummus and a choc. chip cookie.	1
what a disappointment. i came here yesterday to play catch up with a really good friend. we had heard great things about this place and were excited to try it. we were greeted immediately. the hostess/waitress/server was extremely friendly. she gave me a heads up that the times possibly changed for the meters outside so i went outside to see if i needed time after 6pm. nope.. still good. anyhoo.. i wish we had heard the special of the day (jambalaya) instead of the meter info cuz my friend woulda ordered that instead. we heard it when she told the table next to us.. oh well.. we already ordered.i ordered the smothered chicken and my friend ordered the country fried steak. everything came out lukewarm. the mac n cheese sure was creamy and cheesy but it was bland. mostly everything was pretty bland. bland lukewarm food is not so yummy. i was disappointed. the rice and gravy was pretty good. not mind blowing. maybe my expectations were too high? the chicken was very tender.. fell right off the bone.. in fact some of the bone went with it... not so fun picking out the small pieces..my friend's CFS was tasty..but also lukewarm. i was trying to figure out what was missing and when she said she wished it was hotter i realized that was it. the dishes came out on the hotter side of lukewarm... how many times do you think i can write "lukewarm" ? lol..1 star for friendly staff. 1 star for the cornbread muffins and individually wrapped butter (i love things that are individually wrapped)sorry hard knox.. i wont be coming back. lukewarm. =P	0
There has got to be something wrong with me! Canter&#39;s is my spot for post-late night recuperation. <br><br>Serving the needs of the night owls across LA, this place is open until 6am.<br><br>They specialize in Jewish delicacies. I am a big fan of their pastrami sandwich. It&#39;s pricey at almost $10 but open late and has a private lot. There is also live music next door. <br><br>I&#39;ve hung out here for HOURS and just talked to friends. <br><br>If you&#39;re ever in the Hollywood area and need a good place to hang out and have a decent meal, this is your place.	1
Fave spot in LT. 1) The patio is magical.2) I'm a sucker for hanging lights and brick walls. Reminds me of outdoor bars in Portland or Brooklyn. 3) Whenever there's a live jazz band or music...Yes. 4) Happy hour is won-der-ful.	1
Editable at best! This place is all about the ambiance....waiters in bow ties, cashier in old school cashiers cage with bars and everything. Lots of food for cheep, but tasteless really. Biscuits & gravy tasted like bologna, potatoes were bland (no spice) and I've had better pancakes at Mc Donald's. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, but if your looking for authentic 1920's dinner experience and really don't care about food...then this is the place for you.	0
A bit overpriced for what it is. At least it's open late. For a more than $13 sandwich, I was expecting a little more. Turkey, lettuce, and bread--that's all you get. Would totally be satisfied if it were $6.	0
Went here last with my boyfriend. The food was good. I had the Sate dinner and I really enjoyed it. My boyfriend has always said he's not a fan of Thai food but he said he really liked his food last night. The restaurant itself looks a little torn up and outdated. When we walked in nobody greeted us and I had to go up to somebody to ask for service but at least the staff was very friendly.	1
The food is exceptional, but the service needs improvement.	1
Great meal, but need good gluten and dairy free desserts!	1
So, thanks to the owners for bringing fresh presence into this rather desolate part of South Street. My sense of this bustling, yet grungy area, is that this is the next Meatpacking of Downtown (give or take 10 years).<br><br>This is a bold bar / restaurant, clearly intentioned by those creating it. A rich and almost romantic environment (I say almost, because fishnets from the ceiling are not romantic), deep stain wooden tables, white tile, an oyster bar feel. Yet I would say that the room feels a little fussy. I understand a couple of gilded mirrors, but with over half a dozen, it felt an overdone room.<br><br>Service was the next thing. I agree with below, its enthusiastic - yet that came across as overbearing. Service was certainly well intentioned, highly respectful - yet the moments of awkwardness felt with staff leaning in too close, peering in every 5 minutes - my sense is that they need to work on their finesse.<br><br>Food was good quality and fresh. I think the highlight was the Lobster Risotto, with intense lobster and clean ramp flavors - though the risotto itself needed more time to develop - still a wonderful dish for which I would return in a flash. The charred octopus with brazed fennel stalks had a delicate bite. I will say that the menu is confusing, almost as though they need to call it a &#34;preview menu&#34; while they work out what their niche is - and maybe reconsider the rather high prices until they have more of a reputation established (its not Meatpacking just yet).<br><br>Lack of a liquor license really isn&#39;t on in this day and age, its something the owners need to get resolved quickly.<br><br>Overall I think the place has potential. They will need to win locals over to be sustainable. Hopefully this summer season they can iron out the service consistency and space issues. I would love to go back in six months and see if things have developed.	0
Damn I have been eating alot of Hawaiian food since coming to Vegas. <br><br>This is my top pick for Hawaiian BBQ in the Sahara area. Everything I have tried so far has been good here. <br><br>The combo a lot of food and cheap. Co-workers told me about this and it is awesome . <br><br>This is the place of perference for Island style food around the area.<br><br>The place is kinda small with limited seating but who cares if the food is good.	1
I really liked this place. Super clean and fun to go to. I had the Black and Blue--with caramelized onions and blue cheese on it, and the chocolate shake. The shake was to die for! I'll be back. I liked the sandwich a lot, but I only eat beef once in a blue moon, so next time it will be for fries or a shake. Maybe they'll make me a grilled cheese? By the way, there is a place where you can get condiments to the side. I got the horseradish sauce and it was great!	1
Used to love this place, but the past couple years have taken a downturn with higher prices (inevitable) plus smaller portions on many of the dishes I like (not inevitable), and their elimination of most of the menu items that aren't breakfast-type dishes or sandwiches. After taking a year-long break, I went back with a friend. I ordered my usual, the Thai Cobb salad, and it was a third smaller than they used to make it. My friend ordered a cup of soup, and the cup was downsized. The quality of the food was comparable to the old days, and my friend liked his Sloppy Joe a lot. Really disappointed with the menu changes. They removed all the dinner-type meals, and the chicken pot pie is sorely missed. They did add one excellent dessert, an apple crumble, which filled a need for something fruity. But it looks like I'm not the only one who has given up on this formerly jumping hot spot. We went on a Saturday night and got a booth right away. That never used to be the case. The counter was totally empty and at one point it looked like there were more employees than customers. I hope they can turn it around but it seems to be a problem with newer management.	0
Pass on Maximiliano. We saw the high reviews and had good expectations walking in. What we got was mediocre fare, high prices, and really snobby attitude.The mediocre fare:The potato pizza was surprisingly bland. While the crust was toasted and yeasty, the cheese and potatoes were undersalted, and tasted like there was no sauce. We were dousing it with parm/spices/dipping it in the meatball sauce just to pick up some extra flavor.High prices:$6 for a beer. $6 for a "carafe" of coffee that only serves 1.5 ppl.The snobby attitude: I normally never try to fault the restaurant for bad service, but this was a little above and beyond. The waiter would roll his eyes and look impatient as we asked for recommendations, cut us off/walk away when we were talking to him. This was 11pm at night when the area was relatively empty.	0
Place is very loud, and owner has a self-righteous attitude. We were trying to have dinner there, but there was a huge TV in the beer garden at full volume. Impossible to have a good dinner conversation. Upon asking the owner whether he can reduce the volume, his response was NO, that he likes it this way. We walked out of the place and will never come back. <br><br>Dear Owner, with that self-righteous attitude, running a restaurant may not be the right business for you. In case you haven&#39;t heard, in service businesses like restaurants, there is a saying that customer&#39;s always right. Good luck.	0
tried this chain once in San Diego and now in LA. The service is slow!!!!! the ingredients are mostly bland or mildly flavored. Not impressed, If you have to go to something with a similar concept got to Slater's instead. They go get 5 stars for designing a menu that lacks flavor. Sorry this one is not for me	0
Chicken is good here. Dont be fooled by kyochon's nonsense across the street. Their dahk gang jung, bool dahk and yangnyum chicken are must try. They are very hot and spicy so make sure to grab some beers to wash them down with. Their breaded chickens have a very good batter to meat ratio. Their fried/roasted chickens are so succulent and juicy that it just.....oh man, just try them. Make sure to get the corn & cheese and tortillas as side items to make a wrap to eat the chickens with. They also have beer here. Chicken and beer = perfect combo right?They offer valet parking and there are meter parking around serrano, 6th, and on wilshire. It is located right next to caffe concerto.	1
Awesome spot. The drinks are great and the food is delicious.	1
I feel personally slighted every time I walk by and see this place empty.<br><br>The menu has about a dozen total items and absolutely no theme. But whatever. Everything is amazing so they can make the menu as short and nonsensical as they&#39;d like.<br><br>Everyone&#39;s raved about brunch and dinner, so I might as well add that the desserts are also spectacular. Oh my, the profiteroles!<br><br>TIP: feel free to sound like an idiot pronouncing the name because no one knows how to.	1
I came in here for a drink with a friend on a Saturday night. I had a house margarita. First off it looked like water and ice with salt around the rim. It tasted about the same as it looked. We ordered some Wasabi fries... uh, they were under done. I&#39;m sure they would&#39;ve been great if they were cooked right. I really wanted to try the fried mac and cheese lollipops, but they were sold out around 8:30pm. <br>Yeah, I won&#39;t be coming back.	0
The food was spot on delicious. The service or complete lack thereof was unforgivable. Drinks (beer & a glass of wine) came 25 minutes after ordering. Appetizers were delivered to another table. Our table was cleared after we finished our appetizers (when they finally arrived) we were asked if we had more food coming (yes we said our entrees). We sat for 45 minutes. Nothing came. No one ever talked to us (another glass of wine? Your dinners should be right out etc.). Nothing. Lots of staff walking around doing something but we had no food or drink. We finally flagged someone down. They had not placed the order for our entrees. Food finally arrived again the food was wonderful (although the catfish was a bit undercooked). Even after staff became aware of the problem with our sevice they didn't quite know what to do. All the staff is clueless. I would recommend you not go to Ba Bar for a few months & then see if they figure out how to run a restaurant. Great food yes but I can get great Vietnamese food somewhere else & not be completely forgotten by the staff.	0
I was surprised that not only were beers on tap $6, but that they were out of most of them. On a Thursday in the early evening.	0
Over priced drinks and mediocre food... Great atmosphere and crowd though.	0
I was going to give four stars until i saw the check,<br>I did a double take so fast I almost hurt my neck.<br>We had eaten SO much and it had tasted SO good,<br>But they sell food for less than you&#39;d think that they could.<br>Could not have asked for more from my chicken stew,<br>My friend got the pepper steak and he was happy too. <br>I also want to thank the staff, whose friendly presence,<br>Compensated for the lack of any ambience. <br>Zoralie is a Hell&#39;s Kitchen hole in the wall,<br>But for cheap food and great service, give them a call.	1
Came here one month ago and had a wine for $110 that they are now charging $140 for. I know you have to pay rent but why put the cost on me?	0
This place is tops. Amazing food, great service, and a fantastic atmosphere. The skirt steak was beautiful and delicious. The Gnocchi was also unbelievable. I can&#39;t recommend this place enough.	1
I was unfortunately very dissatisfied with my visit. After having been recommended by more than one person for their Thai food, the Pad Thai and Massaman dishes were bland and lacked many key ingredients. The Pad Thai was particularly sparse lacking leeks, raddish, and especially the bean sprouts....and it isn't Pad Thai without bean sprouts.	1
The shrimp soup is to DIE FOR. The Pad thai and curries are a little on the expensive side. But they deliver and are super sweet.	1
Solid food, good service... Nice addition to Hell&#39;s Kitchen	1
I frequent Fred 62s when I'm drunk at 2-5 am bc they have the best ice water in town. And I'm not talking about the water...but the ICE is to die for!	1
Cuban, healthy, delicious. No, I&#39;m not describing myself. LOL!!! I&#39;m describing the food at Fat Busters. I have woken up from the spell that Cuban food can&#39;t be healthy. <br><br>Fat busters is awesome. My girlfriend and I had a dentist appointment nearby and I had this place bookmarked so I decided to come. The place was 2 minutes to closing but the lady was super helpful and apologetic. She kept repeating, if we would have been there earlier we would have seen and taste more food. The service in itself was great.<br><br>On to the food. The fact that she let us tried everything before we ate is worth the 4 stars. We finally decided on the chicken vaca frita with brown rice and cream of broccoli , my girlfriend had the turkey meatballs with fufu and cream of broccoli as well and we got a third one with sliced turkey and smashed sweet potato. I know, a lot of food. But everything was delicious. The chicken vaca frita was great the fufu was sooo soft and smashed sweet potatoes so creamy and sweet. The cream of broccoli was delicious. <br><br>For desert I had the whole wheat bread pudding. Also delicious.<br><br>Good Cuban food, healthy. Sign me up.	1
I'm a fan. everything I've had at this place has been outstanding, from the fresh fruit smoothies to the ice cream to the pizza to the daily chef specials - one rack of lamb served in a skilled with a memorable glaze atop each rib,	1
The place was jumping when our party of five arrived, but our table was waiting for us.  Out terrific server, Judy, appeared with menus and collected drink orders.  Several of us were having wine, and she mentioned two wines that were specially priced by the bottle.  We settled on the Cabernet  blend, which was very nice.  The steaks ordered were perfectly prepared and delicious.  They do have a separate GF menu, although no GF bread or rolls, and I looked longingly at the bread basket delivered to the table!  We were there to celebrate a birthday, and a beautifully decorated dessert plate containing a selection of GF pastries and fresh berries arrived.  Enough for everyone to have a bite.  A perfect compliment to a delicious meal!	1
*****The best*****<br><br>LCA takes all the stress out of being veg or vegan and it&#39;s tasteeeeee. The staff always seems to be making things from scratch which is a good sign.<br><br>Haven&#39;t tried everything, but I would like to. Coconut bacon (vegan) and scrambled tofu crepe was yummm as was the cappucino with homeade almond milk. <br><br>And the staff is so nice!! SO NICE	1
Jewish delis are dying out, but we're glad this one is still alive. Our family considers this the only place we could ever possibly eat when we come to "Jew Town".We often come here for large family brunches, but we were very happy with our service the last time we came. We don't remember the waiter's name, but his service was an example of what all waiters should do. He welcomed us, was patient, and always kept our glasses filled. Service was relatively quick (food was not too slow- after all it gets packed on a Sunday afternoon).We also got hamentashen and cheesecake. Hamentashen had dry bread, but the poppyseed center was delicious. For a better poppyseed taste, try the other bakery treat with the ingredient that they offer (can't remember that name either).My favorite dish is the corned beef reuben. My parents typically get pastrami and corned beef sandwiches.	1
We stopped in with a small group on the patio for a late lunch. From the food to the service, there was really nothing good, or even passable. The food was terrible, the waiter messed up every part of our order possible and was extremely rude. Might make the top 5 worst dining experiences. Definitely worse calamari. Considering the quality of the food and service I would be hesitant to try anything served raw.	0
I love you Toast.<br>But I hate the line.	1
I&#39;d read reviews and ordered breakroom burger... well, this was not as expected. The toppings were decent but the patty and buns were mediocre imo.	0
This place is super Brooklyn. Cool, cozy bar with an even cooler outside seating area with mismatched furniture. <br><br>The bar gets a tad busy and it could take a while to get a drink. <br><br>I ordered a cheeseburger and thought it wasn&#39;t half bad! I enjoyed the fries too, they were sprinkled in coarse pepper.<br><br>The service was friendly.	1
Ah, the old trick where the waitstaff is all attractive co-eds. Well, plus the one handsome guy in his 40s. To balance things out.<br><br>If you were riding Amtrak, and Amtrak fed you Lulu food, you&#39;d be pretty damn excited. Same deal if this were room service food.<br><br>But you&#39;re at a restaurant in a desirable location in a neighborhood in a city where lots of residents and visitors have money to spend. They can do a lot better than this.<br><br>I assume most things are pre-assembled beyond the ordinary restaurant prep. The hamburger wasn&#39;t bad, but it wasn&#39;t great, and I honestly wasn&#39;t sure whether it had been cooked to order. <br><br>I don&#39;t know, man. This place for all the world feels like a good airport restaurant, and I&#39;m surprised some larger hospitality group isn&#39;t behind it.<br><br>PS This review was originally removed, ostensibly because of a &#34;personal attack&#34; I made against a customer who was nameless and unidentifiable by my words. Lulu&#39;s sucked enough that I&#39;m motivated to repost the review. <br><br>And I&#39;ll continue posting to the effect that people should expect children at outdoor restaurants before 6 PM. Especially if those restaurants serve hamburgers. If this arrangement poses a problem for people, they should dine later and/or pay less attention to children who are well behaved.	0
Wow we went here about a year ago and I&#39;ve been bugging my boyfriend to return since but, boy, was I ever disappointed! First things first, the chuchi bowl of rice is as good as ever but hello we&#39;re in Miami, I should expect no less! A good bowl of rice isn&#39;t particularly hard to find in Miami and Latin House&#39;s bowl of rice sure isn&#39;t making a lifelong customer out of me - certainly not with their customer service! So my boyfriend finally took me back - for my birthday lunch - after what I can only describe as a decent first time there albeit with excellent food. <br><br>So we get there at 11-ish am, turns out they don&#39;t open until noon - which we didn&#39;t know. Well, as I&#39;m pulling on the door handle before realizing this, there is an employee staring right at me just beyond the door who wasn&#39;t even kind enough to open the door and let me know or, at the very least, gesture something that would clue me in. So we sat outside and waited for little less than an hour - by far the most highly anticipated letdown of the year. At some point, a young guy clearly dressed as a server walks up to the restaurant so I ask &#34;excuse me, do you work here?&#34; And wouldn&#39;t you know it, he just kept walking right past me as if no one said anything at all - and, no, he didn&#39;t have headphones on or any other excuse. When we eventually got in the restaurant for lunch, there was the very same server sitting down ever so comfortably waiting for his first table so it wasn&#39;t even as if he was in a rush to go do something productive with his time.<br><br>As soon as we sat down, pumped about my birthday, I started looking over the drink menu. Well, that didn&#39;t last long because no sooner than I had picked it up off the table our &#34;server&#34; LITERALLY snatched it out of my hand. Dumbfounded, I looked up only to be told &#34;we don&#39;t have anything on that menu.&#34; Uhm, excuse me?!?!? What? Come again??? What do you mean you &#34;don&#39;t have anything on that menu&#34;? And how do you explain the fact that your hostess JUST sat me down and handed it to me? Nope, no explanations were given, just that they didn&#39;t have ANYTHING on that menu. Politely, I say something along the lines of &#34;well, that was also the drink menu did you realize that?&#34; at which point this dimwit of a server (not the same guy who ignored me outside) - whose name I never got because he was never polite enough to tell us, shocker! - said oh yea sorry and gave back the very same menu he had snatched out of my hands a minute earlier. So we order our food and it EASILY took us an hour to receive a chimiburrito, a chuchi bowl of rice, and an order of tacos. I understand that this isn&#39;t fast food and it&#39;s clearly stated on their menu but I&#39;m sorry the wait is simply not worth it, especially when your server is nowhere to be found the entire hour. Alas, the food FINALLY arrives. Clearly starved, we go to work and are finished eating in roughly 15 minutes. Well, it would be about another 20 before we got our check and 20 more before the server picked up the bill and rang us up. I would love to say that the restaurant was busy but, in fact, it wasn&#39;t. Actually, once we set our credit card on the little receipt tray, in plain sight, our server walked by our table about 6-8 times on the way to the table immediately next to us without ever bothering to pick it up and charge us. If we were any other customers, we very well could have walked out the door - and with the amount of time we were waiting to close out our check, let me tell you, I would NOT have been remorseful if we had. It&#39;s not like one goes out PLANNING to dine and dash but when your server is not only not interested in charging you but clearly not at all concerned about his tip, there&#39;s only so much the customer - and in this case, birthday girl - can put up with. Like I said, we won&#39;t be back because the food here simply isn&#39;t good enough to justify a 2-hour lunch break or waiting 40 minutes to close out your check. Good riddance, Latin House.	0
Beef tripe was not good - little tripe, much fat<br>Dough-wrapped Chinese cruller was very bad, perhaps day old - no texture<br>Wonton soup was very bad - texture and taste of wonton meat filling was off, soup had too much msg and no other flavor.	0
I love the classy feel and hipster vibes. You have a range of people coming here dressed anywhere from casual to business professional.Ordered a draught beer, the Chimay White which is Belgian tripel. 8.4% alcohol. Quite reminiscent of Blue Moon in taste. Came in a tulip glass. Ordered wasabi fries to compliment the beer. The sauce was quite strong in the wasabi flavor. Got my eyes teary, but I must admit it is pretty good food for alcohol.I must say I should return a few more times before reviewing the place and giving it an actual rating. But for now, it goes on the top of my list.	1
Just ok. <br><br>I can&#39;t think of anything really good about this place. The line was long, about an hour (luckily my sister was smart to wait for us as my relative got ready) and just ok with the food. <br><br>I ordered the garlic chicken but was brought something else, more like chicken cutlet. I mean whatever, I was so hungry I didn&#39;t care. I ate it, it was ok. A pretty big portion, I couldn&#39;t even finish the whole thing. <br><br>One weird thing is the amount of people visiting from Hawaii that eat there. I mean I get it, you&#39;re comfortable eating food that you like but there&#39;s SOO many places to eat in Vegas, why eat something you can get ANYWHERE at home.	0
It exceeded the hype and our expectations. This is more than dining - it&#39;s a unique experience that makes you want to keep going back for more. The entire staff was involved in our meal and made us feel like the only guests from the moment we arrived. <br><br>Certainly will dine at KO again - will just need to shake the money tree beforehand	1
We went here on a recommendation from a friend and it was perfect. The service was friendly, the price just right. We order the roast chicken, pernil asado and side of yellow rice and pinto beans. Everything was done brilliantly.<br><br>While the decor is more of I came to your grandmother&#39;s kitchen for dinner and nothing special but don&#39;t let that stop you from coming in. You&#39;ll want to come back for more.	1
Driest, crispiest, over-cooked medium hamburger I&#39;ve ever had. I ate it and didn&#39;t complain until the end, and at that point the cook probably thinks that it was good enough if I ate most of it anyway, but I was too distracted by the meeting I was having to be interrupted by bad food. <br><br>I&#39;d heard such good things for years about this place and now that I live in the neighborhood I thought I would clearly be coming here a lot... what a let down. Boo! If a restaurant can&#39;t get something as simple as a burger right (especially with the word &#39;farm&#39; in the title) it can tell you what everything else is going to be like.	0
You get a lot for a little price and you get to choice what raw ingredient. Appetizer chicken dumplings is not with the price. It's uneven with the menu price so don't order it. The food is alright. A very good price for a whole lot of food. Variety of vegetables and sauce are a plus. Protein collection is also decent including beef, chicken, white fish, sausage and squid.	0
This is one of those true Yelp success stories.	0
Just to start off, I'm a pretty simple guy, not into fancy expensive stuff, and can eat anything. My sister took me here for dinner 'cause she wanted to try it out. I was just along for the ride. She ordered bone marrow appetizer because she heard it was good. It was okay, personally, I preferred the free bed and butter and maybe a sprinkle of salt that came with.For the main course, my sister got the duck which she liked, and I got the lamb, which I thought was pretty good. Overall, I don't know if I have the discernible palette to really appreciate the $30/plate food here. I remember the server describing a dish and explaining why the bread was toasted with duck fat so it would compliment something else on the plate, and it blew my mind how meticulous and thoughtful the preparation of food here is.So the quality of this place is definitely very good. Food took forever, don't know why. Overall, I wouldn't be regular here because I enjoy cheaper, heartier food, but a great place to enjoy an experience and try something new.	1
So worth it if you want to drop a hundo for biscuits and delicious condiments. Service is warm and welcoming, but stay away from the $32 shrimp boil. First of all, $32 for a pile of corn cobs, potatoes, and shrimp with legs? Legs! And the mushroom polenta was either totally bland or else my taste buds had been burned off because it was served scalding hot.	0
I went with my bf for dinner. We had the spicy chorizo, empanadas, a 40 oz porterhouse steak and wine. The spicy chorizo was not spicy but it was good, same goes for the overpriced empanadas. The porterhouse steak is good to share between 2. I am glad we order wine to wash out the palate of the fatty steak, the wine was half off if you go from monday-wed. The website with the menu is not working, I noticed most of the items are quite pricey. Overall I enjoyed my experience with a dark romantic restaurant and friendly staff. will I go back? maybe for special occasions	1
Lame.<br><br>My dinner was so rushed I don&#39;t remember anything.<br><br>A RUSHED DINNER?<br><br>WHAT TASTES GOOD ABOUT A DINNER AT AN UBER-EXPENSIVE PLACE THAT&#39;S RUSHED?!<br><br>Goodbye.	0
I&#39;d have to admit, the Sul lung tang here is pretty good. It&#39;s not as good as Han Bat, but this is definitely my go-to spot late night.<br><br>Parking:<br>Lot in the back	1
An extremely pretentious restaurant; my experience here was horrid. My girlfriend and I were in Las Vegas for a friend&#39;s wedding when I decided to take her to Sage to celebrate her upcoming birthday. We entered the restaurant and were seated in an uncomfortable booth that contained several pillows. My girlfriend has a bad back, so we requested to move to a table. The restaurant was more than half empty, but the server still rudely and condescendingly scoffed at us, refusing to accommodate our request because the tables were &#34;for four-tops&#34;. I thought he was kidding at first; when I realized he was serious, we got up and exited the restaurant. The staff noticed us leaving and requested we stay. No, thank you!	0
One of the biggest and most varied menus I've ever seen but everything has been good across the board so far, with the exception of the pour over coffee. The matcha latte is ok. The parmesan truffle fries are EVERYTHING.	1
This is a great family owned restaurant. Their Thai Chicken is the best thing on the menu, I recommend it to anyone! It has just the right amount of kick with even bigger flavor!	1
Black guy with light eyes at the door ruined the place for me... Acting like secret service.. Door man!	0
I'm starting to feel a little self-conscious about all the five stars I've been handing out lately. Maybe I'm in a really good mood, or I'm just having lots of awesome experiences lately. Nearly four years after moving to LA, my boyfriend and I finally made it here and it lived up to the hype. My pastrami reuben was heaven on bread, the matzo ball soup is perfect on a rainy day and the pickles are pure heaven. The decor is tacky, the people are frumpy and the food is great. I can't wait to go back.	1
I don&#39;t know what has happened and if management has just completely stopped caring about this place, but this has by far been my worst experience here. First of all, they got our order wrong and brought us a pork and shrimp bowl instead of a pork and shrimp egg roll. We ended up keeping it to not have to deal with the hassle of getting a refund. We also ordered the Dae Ji and the tater tots. The tots were the only edible part of this meal. The two bowls were so dry and lacked any kind of flavor. The pork in both bowls was way over done. Just an all round terrible experience combined with a general lack of any kind of customer service. As much as I used to love this place, I am so disappointed to see it go to this level. Definitely won&#39;t be coming here again.	0
I love this place so much! They definitely make everything to order. It wasn't raining much today & California is in a drought so it's understandable that we got no refills. Also, it's great that it takes over half and hour to get the salad because I know they're taking their time growing out the lettuce! Too bad we went at night because there was no natural sunlight to speed it the cropping process. Their chicken was really good and fresh since you can hear the chickens quack in the back. Their ceramics team was kind of slow so it took a while to get plates, but we improvised and used napkins instead! BUT they are really fast when you want the check because they literally run to your table. Overall, I would recommend this place to people who I don't like. :)	0
I used to really dig this place when it first opened for business but Peaches HotHouse may have just lost me as a customer after what I experienced today. Cold food, loose, lumpy grits and scatterbrained waitresses who didn&#39;t take our orders until almost 20 minutes after we were seated. The lipstick stains on our drinking glasses were a HUGE &#39;minus.&#39; Peaches HotHouse needs to worry less about crowd control &amp; more about good service. This restaurant is smaller than most of the apartments in The Stuy. How hard can it be to run it properly?	0
I think because there are not to many authentic Indian resturants in the area this is what keep this establishment going. Don't get me wrong the food is good but for the price it is just not worth it and it seems that they are steady going up on prices. Look around before coming here you may have to commute to find some good Indian food but it would be a lot better then here and the location is not all that great either. So it there at your own risk; for it is a resturant for special occasion per to say meaning you go there every blue moon because of the price.....	0
Well the sandwich is massive the bread is good and the salad is OK. <br><br>The dressing is good too that so much mentioned mustard vinaigrette.<br><br>The only issue is that they run out of bread once in a while leaving people without sandwiches and well its their loss because they stop selling sandwiches I got all of my 3 sandwiches that I ordered but I literally saw about 5 people walk in for a sandwich and walk out empty handed. They lost about $40 bucks there.<br><br>Anyway the cookie was yummy too and the sandwich is good. I had prosciutto with Brie cheese. with Cesar salad no turkey and a cookie and a bottled lemonade which was good but not fresh.	1
Big fatty breakfast. This is what my review is about. My favorite Madison girls and I hit this place up every weekend that I'm around town. Refill my bottomless coffee mug one more time- This is where we hit reset in the morning.	0
I don&#39;t think you can really go wrong with anything on this menu. All of the dressings and sauces are made in house and all of the meat (chicken, pork, beef) is flown in from Japan. It&#39;s really good quality food, made very well, for a very reasonable price.<br><br>Normally, at an Izakaya, I think of alcohol (usually beer) and small plates of food - usually &#34;something raw, something pickled, something fried, and something simmered.&#34; Here, we ordered a bottle of sake ( the Tate no kawa, a jyunmai daiginjyou), and tried both the cassis orange and cassis oolong tea cocktails (to be honest, I don&#39;t recommend either if you don&#39;t like sweet, fruity, or tea flavored drinks), and most of the menu. We couldn&#39;t help it. The food was so good, we just kept wanting more.<br><br>I particularly recommend the Japanese Pork Curry, the Beef Gut Stew, the Japanese Old Style Pasta ( Ketchup) and the Chicken Nanban, Housemade Beef and Pork Croquette, and of course the addictive cabbage. What am I saying? Just order it all.<br><br>The Japanese Pork Curry dish made me never want to get curry anywhere else - it had such a deep, hearty flavor, and I just wanted 3 more bowls of rice so I could soak up all of that delicious curry after all the meat was gone.<br><br>I felt similarly about the Beef Gut Stew, which is made with beef throat, heart, tendon, and two other types that I can&#39;t remember right now. What I do remember though, is that this dish was the perfect balance of savory but with a hint of sweetness that just makes you want to eat every last bit of it. The curry was thick but this stew had almost a broth like consistency. <br><br>If you&#39;re a fan of fried chicken, try the Chicken Nanban. Even though it&#39;s fried, the batter is only mildly crispy and slightly sweet, and the meat inside so tender, soft, and flavorful that it almost felt like they simmered it beforehand. With the house made tar tar sauce, well, this dish just makes you want to come back for more.<br><br>I could really go on and on, but I think you get my gist. <br><br>On top of it all, the service here is top notch and the ambiance relaxed and casual without the usual rowdiness of an izakaya. I almost don&#39;t want to talk about it because I want it to stay that way.<br><br>The waiter was super informative and came out to describe every dish in detail and also provided a lot of recommendations that were all spot on. This feels like a place that cares about not just their food, but you, as well.<br><br>Well worth trying.	1
The ambiance in this night spot is turn't up. Beautiful ladies abound and i'm sure the women feel the same about the fellas. It's a very nice crowd here and the food is very good. The seared ahi tuna is wonderful and light tasting (melt in your mouth type good). We also tried the buffalo frog legs and they were excellent. The view is gorgeous.	1
A friend and I heard that this was one of the top burger joints in LA, so being the foodies we are, we decided to try it out for ourselves. We walk in to see all the seats filled and no hostess to tell you where to sit. Ok I mean I guess that&#39;s pretty cool, being old school and all. It was just kinda awkward cause you have a whole line of people just waiting to pounce on a seat. We sat down after about 20 minutes of waiting and looked at the menu to see only a handful of burger selections. In fact the only difference between the two main burgers was the sauce, but we still rolled with it. The burgers were nothing special at all, as my friend said, &#34;you could get a six dollar burger at Carl&#39;s Jr. and it&#39;d be the same thing.&#34; I just think this place is too hyped up and there are DEFINITELY way more burger joints that deserve to be the top ones in LA. I won&#39;t be coming back here and I suggest going to Umami or Stout if you&#39;re looking for a decent burger with good service.	0
Extremely beautiful restaurant and wonderfully attentive service. For the prices, I expected high level of creativity. Although food prepared well found it average.Would not returnI did enjoy the wine (although very high priced also)	0
Based on the prior reviews, I was expecting spectacular food with spectacular service. I was so disappointed. I went with three other people and the appetizer came out very timely. Then we waited 30 minutes after ordering before the first dishes came out. Okay, no problem. Then the third dish came out 15 minutes after the first dishes came out. The two people in the party who recieved their food early had already finished eating. By 50 minutes in, I still hadn&#39;t recieved my food. Everyone else in my party already finished eating and I was hungrily chewing on my chopsticks. I had to ask the waitress for my food before they gave it to me and by that time I was so annoyed that I couldn&#39;t enjoy it. <br><br>They were barely apologetic. Never again.	0
Great salad bar, entrees prepare as specified, great service.	1
Service was from another more refined age. Nothing old fashioned about the food though. Truly historic portion size was perfect and every fish perfectly balanced.Best NYC restaurant experience in a decade.	1
Place is tiny but don&#39;t let that fool you. The food is incredible and service is great! Still pending their beer and wine license but they do allow BYOB. Constant flow of people and already a regular stream on neighborhood locals, always a good sign. Pork stuffed tostones were great and the huge burrito was incredible. I highly recommend you leave room for the fried oreos. I have had them before but never this good!!! I wish the folks at Tacos and TATTOOS continued success!!! Keep doing things right!!!	1

this new restaurant is great! I&#39;ve been going to chinatown for years and this is my new favorite. every dish was delicious and the waiters were so nice and helpful. try the pork and crab soup buns, they&#39;re the best in chinatown! I loved this place and will definitely be a regular customer!!	1
What we ordered:Tokyo ramen = tasteless Miso ramen = too saltyFried chicken = so soDon't forget to smell the ramen noodles before you eat it.. Simply horrid!	0
This is place is very old in the legendary sort of way. It&#39;s always nice to eat somewhere that you know comes with an extra side of bragging rights to top off you meal. Speaking of meal, the food here is great. It all tastes home cooked and like its actually made with respect, and if you ask me, that goes a long way.<br><br>This place prides itself on being much like Pamela Anderson and never being closed, staying open 24/7. The only draw back to this place is that its located right next to the Staples Center, so if there is an event or game going on, good luck find cheap parking. Which you WON&#39;T.	1
Yahoo! I love coming here! Nadia and Liz make you feel so welcome and their service is excellent... Love the food, especially the Harvest Burger and Manouche Pizza!	1
Pretty painful experience. My girlfriend and I waited 40 minutes (not an exaggeration) for our food to come before we escaped. A table next to us also left after waiting an hour. Waitresses were apologizing, but not really enough given the severity of the problem, and not enough for me to believe this was the first time they delivered such poor service.	0
This was one disappointing dining experience. Maybe the only thing worth checking out on the menu is really the 10-person pork shoulder. Everything else on the menu (and we did sample a lot since I was with a big group) is either mediocre, not worth the price, or both. The rice cakes fall in the former category. The rice cakes were one note and totally oversauced. It was the one dish that our group couldn&#39;t even finish more than a half of. The pork buns were admittedly good, but they were tiny so I couldn&#39;t justify paying as much we did for it. Oysters with kimchee--do you really call putting kimchee sauce on a ho-hum oyster (not even that fresh) &#34;fusion?&#34; <br><br>The only item on the menu that anyone really enjoyed were the brussel sprouts. But oy. Momofuku Ssam bar left all of us feeling like we were just PUNK&#39;D.	0
Great pizza! I&#39;ve only been a couple times and have tried what they had available by the slice (always variety) but I&#39;ve been impressed with what I&#39;ve had.<br>The atmosphere is cool, happy for West Adams to get a nice pizza joint.<br><br>My only complaint is regarding getting pizza to-go. I live right down the street so have only gotten to-go pizza and both times they just staple a plate onto the plate with the pizza. This causes for pizza to stick out the side and crumbs to spill on the short ride home. I&#39;d be happy if they start using legitament to-go boxes!	1
This place was awesome. I heard Starbuck's bought this just so they could have the recipes for their pastries. You can def feel the Starbucks corporate vibe. There is parking directly behind the restaurant. There is no service here. You wait in line and order. The food is then delivered to your table. All of the flatware and the water is self serve unless you order a drink from the menu. We came for breakfast and I ordered their standard dish with scrambled eggs, bacon, toast and fruit. I was very happy. The ceilings are high here and I did not feel bogged down at all.I highly suggest coming here and I'm not sure if they are open for dinner. Check it out!	1
As someone who is currently on a quest to eat every veggie burger in New York City, I was so excited when Umami Burger came to town, with their promise of unique flavor combinations that present a heightened experience of taste. Which I&#39;m sure is divine, just as long as your preferences aligns exactly with theirs. And last night, all I wanted on my veggie burger was some avocado. On the burger, on the side, whichever was easier -- I was more than happy to pay extra. But when I was informed that under no circumstances would I be allowed to have avocado on my burger unless I got a burger with avocado on it (the only burgers with this option being meat-based, and I don&#39;t eat meat) I was a little taken aback. I have worked in the food service industry for a sum total of 13 years, and never in that time did I deny, nor would I have been allowed to deny, a customer anything that we had available, and ready, in-house. Especially something as minimal as a burger condiment. I appreciate that they take pride in the flavor experience they&#39;ve created, but in not allowing me to order something as simple as a side of avocado, it became quite clear that Umami Burger puts itself above the needs and/or desires of its customers. And in a place like New York City, where there are a billion burger places more than willing to accommodate such a simple request, I think I&#39;m probably going to choose the place that lets me just have the freaking avocado already. <br><br>If you&#39;re up for having someone dictate the exact flavor profile of your burger, then Umami Burger is perfect for you. But if you have any special dietary needs and are looking for a burger place that allows you to incorporate fresher, healthier ingredients, there are plenty of other places to choose from.	0
My colleague and I were HORRIFIED by the perfectly atrocious service here. It began when they charged me without telling me to have a side of spinach instead of salad or fries. Then I found a large TWIG in my spinach. When I showed this to a server she basically relayed to me that this was normal. Then our server informed us, without a hint of apology, that it would take TWELVE MINUTES to process our credit cards. Who ARE these people? Never again.	0
The pizza had too much flour on the bottom, I felt like I was eating something that wasn't done baking. I didn't like the taste of the crust, not what I expected from a pizza.	0
Stop. Please. The people who are saying this is the greatest place for a burrito in San Francisco let alone the entire country. Halfway through my carne asada burrito and have yet to have that special bite that would validate such a ridiculous claim.The cashier, cooks and everyone who worked here are great. Shared a brief convo with a guy who gave me my food about the niners game. Real nice people. But the food was just average.My mother makes a burrito way better. Disappointed with all the hype.	0
I was not impressed. The food was bland and my Bloody Mary had little to no Vodka. Mediocre at best.	0
XLB were way too thick. The dumplings were okay. Waited a long time for taro cake, which was a bland pastry. So hot and cramped inside that I waited outside while the check was being paid.	0
Chef Hughes has worked all over the world, and all of his years in France , The Middle East has paid off. His cuisine reflects all of this living abroad. the food at 203 is classic, with global influences. Make sure you ask to speak to him he will amaze you.	0
The better buffet restaurant around the area. Good atmosphere and good food. Will always go back. If you haven't tried it. Go for it. No regrets. ..	1
Well, nothing special here. Soba sauce taste just like soy sauce mix w/ water. One more over rated restaurant. Service is good, place is good, foods... uh uh... I felt so sorry to the food. Maybe, I just don&#39;t like soba.	0
I have been going to Cubana Social for a few months now, having discovered it in the Fall and loved it at first. Its spacious, always pretty empty in the day, and despite the limited menu I liked it. Today, lunch Monday 12th March I went there and had a terrible experience and will never go back. I am only writing this review as the last couple of times I have been there I have had similar, although not quite so bad experiences with at least a few dishes being not available despite the low patronage and sloppy service, so they have run out of chances.<br><br>Today we went for lunch, only three of us, and the place was dead, there were two other covers. We ordered simple half sandwich/soup/salad lunches, after being told both cuban sandwiches and black bean soup were off the menu. How a cuban restaurant has no cuban sandwiches available is beyond me. It also happened last time, &#34;no ham&#34; apparently, this time &#34;no more beans&#34;. <br><br>Anyhow the food was extremely late, and when it came the waitress only brought two plates. She said the other was coming. When it had not appeared after 10 mins i went and asked &amp; again, &#34;oh its coming&#34;. I said I couldn&#39;t wait longer then another 10 minutes as I had a small baby with me, still &#34;its coming&#34;. Eventually she walks over and finally tells the truth that the order is not coming and never has been, she forgot to order it. I understand mistakes happen, but when they do its best to just admit it and not waste everyone&#39;s time.<br><br>She then tells us she wont charge us for the meal we never had! Unbelievable! Anyway all in all a very pitiful experience. Not being able to get three lunch orders right when you have two other tables is lame, as is not being visible to the diners most of the time. My friends also said their chicken sandwiches were dry.<br><br>Its a real shame as the cuban sandwiches are great (the star is wholly for them!), but they never seem to have them, the staff are lackluster and in a competitive restaurant scene like Williamsburg there are just too many other great options like An Nhau where I had a delicious pho banh mi afterwards as I was STARVING.<br><br>When you leave a restaurant starving, its best not to go back ;-)	0
I really don't want to like you Churchill. Like, REALLY don't want to like you.I came here on a cold, dark Wednesday night. You took my breath away, or perhaps the swinging door did each time a patron left or entered. You have a patio. You have indoor seating. You were surprisingly full.The food is great - from what I remember for happy hour, tapas were the name of the game. The cocktails were SO MUCH FUN! They had a bacon one, that was surprisingly not disgusting and allegedly has actual bits of bacon in it. There were about six others - all good and gourmet-ish.The decor is modern British chic. The bathroom needs a good rub-down. Crowd is thirties-ish.The service wasn't great and there is a bit of a sceney-ness to it, but I will be back. If you will have me.One last thing: I'm not an expert on happy hours, so I was under the impression that if you just got there and ordered by the end of happy hour that you would get happy hour pricing. Not so. We were a little frightened and bewildered by our check.	1
Wonderful tapas and great wine. Our server was aloof and service was s-l-o-w. Our finnicky dinner guests weren't thrilled with the authentic and adventuesome Spanish menu selections. True food lovers will adore this place.	1
They&#39;ve definitely changed up their menu a bit, some of the more adventurous flavours have gone, but I still like what they offer and tend to gravitate here for a relaxed evening.<br><br>The staff are always friendly, there&#39;s a decent choice of beers and the simplified menu still hits the spot, even though I did really like some of their previous offerings.	1
Food, service and ambiance made the evening a wonderful experience.	0
Great place to be at night. Ambiance is wonderful & the view is gorgeous! Loved the shrimp cocktail & fries	1
If you ain&#39;t black,, get back.<br><br>We had a horrible experience here last visit.<br>Black employees would seat black guests, while white and Asians and Hispanics could wait for a seat at the back of the bus.<br><br>Black customers offered booths,, other non-black customers refused booths and were only allowed tables in the middle of the dining room.<br><br>Complaints to the manager fell on deaf ears. He grabbed his car keys and left the scene.<br><br>Black employees brutally rude and ignoring to non-black customers.<br>Friendly and helpful to black customers.<br><br>We&#39;re regulars here spend freely and we tip very well, and this place ain&#39;t cheap.<br><br>Reverse discrimination at it&#39;s lowest.<br>We won&#39;t be back.	0
Great corned beef! As you should expect with the name being what it is. I will definitely go back.<br><br>It is take out and cash only so be ready. <br><br>The staff was very nice. <br><br>Great sandwiches.	1
Typical New York attitude, not friendly at all. There was no eye contact, no smile, and no suggestions. It was like we were bothering them.<br><br>We asked about pizza, and they failed to tell us about the specials. We saw the sign afterwards.<br><br>The large white clam pizza($17) was ok, the dough was on the dry side, no flavor at all and it was not raised properly. The pizza did come with a lot of chopped clam. But the large amount of clam made the pizza fishy. Also there was a good amount of cheese, which I think was not necessary.<br><br>Personally, I think pizza should be about the dough. Without a good dough, you are just trying to cover incompetence with lots of toppings.<br><br>This place is definitely overrated and overpriced.	0
2 stars not for the food. The food was quite good. The value however was terrible. Prices were way over priced for the portions. You could get the same food down the block for 25% of the price. Service was pretty terrible. $15 for a plate of friend rice I would expect it to be huge and with service. Same goes for the 1/2 duck that was more like 1/4 duck for $20. So for a real chinese restaurant in Chinatown, the prices are like downtown NYC.Hard for me to recommend. Maybe once to "experience" it. But I won't be going back. Ever.	0
After reading reviews I chose to dine here after seeing Le Reve. Not only because of the reviews but because of the convenience of not having to go elsewhere for dinner. I ordered the Ribeye (medium) and it was not nearly worth the price. Didn't have good seasoning and seemed more medium well. The wait staff was great though. Very friendly and energetic.	0
They have draft WINE!!! I really wish I could shake the hand of the genius who made that happen. The waitress recommended a carafe of their Jackhammer red wine and it was delicious. The carafe was only 17 bucks and gave 2 glasses of wine for both myself and my roomate so that's less than 9 bucks for two glasses, WIN!As for the food we ordered their hash, almond green beens, and sweet corn. All three were fresh and flavorful. The pizzas I saw coming out looked yummy as well so I definitely plan to come back here to try them since this place is walking distance from my house.A little birdie there told me they are entertaining the idea of a late night happy hour so if the owners are reading this PRETTY PLEASE make that happen! I would be the most loyal of customers, because the Palms area sure needs something like that LOL.	1
We were a party of 5 celebrating a wedding anniversary. The staff was pleasant, helpful and warm. We decided to sit outside and this was easily arranged. The servers were knowledgeable, professional yet friendly and informal. No intimidation or stuffiness here.Our menu selections were served in a very timely manner. And the food was excellent.The view from almost any place in the restaurant is a panorama of the Baltimore Harbor and, especially in the summer months, transforms itself as the sun sets. I'd certainly suggest bringing a camera.We will certainly return to the Olive Room again; it was a very enjoyable evening.	0
Found this deli on Yelp as we were driving through the neighborhood and it is so cute and delightful. We had toast skagen (shrimp on brioche), meatballs (as good as ikea) and swedish pancakes which were all delicious. They also sell Scandinavian products and like a kid in a new candy store, I made the mistake of shoving every kind of sugary, gummy, colorful, sticky, chewy, chocolatey, licorey, foreign-sounding candy into my brown paper bag.... and making myself feel guilty over the past 2 days. Will be back!	1
Bouchon has surpassed many in terms of both service &amp; food quality.I think great staff &amp; warm service makes the whole dining experience just that more wonderful.Thank you all at Bouchon for a memorable evening for me &amp; my family as we celebrated the Lunar New Year!P/S: Special thanks to the waiter who cleared our table constantly with warm smile.Warm Regards,Mel	1
This is our second time back to Blossom and the experience was terrific. The only small minor issue was our guests checked in first before us and upon our arrival at the host desk, we identified ourselves but one of the hosts stated that there was no reservation under our name as she searched thru the computer screeen. In about 2 minutes, her colleague remembered that our guests had checked in and had already sat in the table and immediately, she took us to our table without further inquiries. The rest of the evening went smoothly and the food was terrific as always. Thanks again.	1
I created my Yelp account because of this place.I've gone to Pier 23 Cafe twice now, and I will not go back again. Trip 1: The first time was after a Giants game, around sunset. The place was quite crowded, and I had to act like a vulture and try to track down chairs to take away from tables as people would get up. For the first half of the meal some of us had stools from other tables that were too high for our table. The service was nothing special or bad - just what you would hope for. The food was OK at best on this trip, but I didn't order anything too complicated (fish & chips and clam chowder). The food was overpriced though. Our group sat outside and an obviously drunk guy two tables away, over the course of about 10 minutes, chucked his empty glasses of beer, plates, utensils, etc into the Bay from his seat - and he wasn't exactly sitting near the water. Somehow, the people working there either missed this or just didn't care. Trip 2: A buddy of mine and I went there to grab a late afternoon bite to eat. The place was not busy at all and we were seated in about 5 minutes in the smallest table in the place. The table could barely fit one meal and a drink on it if we tried. A bigger table, happened to open up next to us after a couple got up to leave, and I asked the waitress if we could move tables. She said no problem and sat us at a table made for 4. After waiting about 10 minutes the waitress finally came back and took our drink orders. Before the drinks were brought to us, the hostess comes up to us and makes us move tables because we are a group of 2 sitting at a 4 person table. I thought it was ironic since two people were just sitting there before us, but we went along with it. Without going into too much boring detail, the server was as slow as you can be and was quite inattentive (never asked how we were doing, water glasses were not filled unless asked, etc.). For the meal we got nachos and clam chowder for appetizers and chicken breast sandwich and fries for the entree. The nachos were AWFUL and overpriced. The nachos at any ballpark taste better, and I'm pretty sure they use the same liquid cheese. How can you not use real cheese on restaurant nachos? The clam chowder was good, but nothing special. The chicken breast sandwich and fries were not bad, but it too was overpriced. While serving the entree, the bus boy dropped a plate and some sauces on my buddy. It turned out to be less of a mess only because we both caught some of the flying debris in midair. I made the joke to my buddy, well we have everything we need - no way this get worse. A minute later, the person at the table next to us starts to smoke. The staff there did nothing about it, and let her smoke. Once our meal from hell was over, we just wanted to leave. We had been done with our meal for a good 20 minutes before we ever saw our server, and had to flag her down to get the check. I got the check, and guess what, apparently soda refills aren't free. Oh, and by the way, parking is a hassle. Mark this place down as not a place to visit.	0
Sorry but your reign as top soup dumpling should be revoked.when I come to the city I always get recommended to go eat soup dumplings, so much so that i got soup pouring out of my ears. I usually go to the dumpling kitchen, 2 blocks from kingdom and with a friends recommendation I tried decided to go here instead.Maybe we ordered wrong but their standard Xiaolongbaos were not good for us. some were dry while others were too salty. The regular food we order had small portions and again salty.I will come back whenever I can convince and pry my wife away from dumpling kitchen.their dipping sauce is to my liking though, love the sourness.	0
Eh. It&#39;s an out of the way, hidden cafe with patrons from the corporate offices that surround it. If I worked in the offices around baguette cafe, I&#39;d probably go back since there&#39;s nothing within walking distance around it. But I definitely won&#39;t make a trip there for lunch or breakfast. The food was decent, but nothing memorable.	0
Amazing new spot. Organic, fresh imaginative. Truly a discovery! I will be back. The chef is an Anthony Bourdain prodigy and it shows!	1
good food good service but the kitchen needs to work a little faster. I saw some issues with speed from the time people were placing there order....	1
Since they've opened I've enjoyed every meal at Petra. And I go at least once a week. 	1
I had dinner here last night and it was great. Steak tartar was amazing and the mussels were perfectly done. I will go back for sure.	1
@TokyoDoggieStyl<br>Aside from the double entendre name, I was intrigued when I discovered this truck lurking in front of LACMA over the weekend.<br>Here you have something as basically American as the hot dog fused with arguably one of the most elegant cuisines in the world, Japanese cuisine. The possibilities are endless and as this menu shows not all Japanese food contains raw fish.<br>I tried their signature curry dog. Although I couldn&#39;t identify most of what was on this dog, I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was tasty and bursting with new flavors one may not be used to on a hot dog.<br>I really want to find this truck again to try some of their other offerings. They show<br>takoyaki, (Octopus Balls), lychee lemonade, a bacon wrapped hawaiian dog, seaweed salad, steamed edamame, (soybeans), a rethought version of Musubi and a vegetarian dog.<br>The curry dog was very tasty, and texturally felt good to eat.<br>And since I have to wait before trying this one again I&#39;ll close with this...<br>_________________they&#39;re STALKER APPROVED!	1
No raw oyster. ok not their fault. ordered 12 steamed. waited 30 min. asked about my order. went to check on it. didn&#39;t come back after 5 min. put $6 down for my beer and left.	0
Presidio Social Club sucks! Our waiter was totally rude and ignored us for a while before coming over to ask if we wanted anything to drink.We ordered the grilled cheese appetizer and I couldn't even taste the cheese. I ordered the kobe beef sloppy joe which was good but I like the original version from the packet better. My roomie ordered the pork - disgusting! It was cold and gross and she had to flag down a different waiter to send it back since our waiter never checked back with us after we received our food.We got the banana cream pie and cookie plate for dessert. The pie was good, cookies were nothing special. The decor was kinda cool and I liked the campy/bunkerish vibe. All in all, I could have spent my money better elsewhere.	0
Amazing food and drinks! I def recommend the Beef Tenderloin Tips and the Mac n Cheese. Everything comes out hot, fresh and tasty.<br><br>The bartender takes his time time making the drinks to perfection. <br><br>Only knock on this place is the food takes a long time to come out. So if you are on a schedule, this isn&#39;t the place for you.	1
Horrible food! What a disappointment. Frozen food, just microwaved. Would not go to this place again.	0
Cute place so much charm. Staff is so friendly and the food is super tasty! I highly recommend it.	1
Place is... tiny food is very good.... has a kick.	1
We've been here twice. On our first visit, the food was good but service somewhat lacking. On the second visit, I ordered the same exact thing, but the quality wasn't there for the price you pay at this place... and the service even worse. They got an order wrong, our son didn't get his food until we were finished eating, we kept asking to get our water refilled and were ignored. There were people at other tables, but the place wasn't that busy. Parents take note: they only have one highchair for the entire restaurant.	0
Absolutely terrible service. Staff is not well trained. Took 15 minutes to find waiter, then 30 minutes to NOT get our drinks. Not even water. Went to the bar to try to order drinks which took another 10 minutes. To make matters worse place was half empty. The only reason for 2 stars is for its creative decor.	0
Dr. Robbin Bistro is an odd name for a restaurant; cant' really think of what kind of cuisine this place would serve, especially in Koreatown. I met a few friends to grab a quick bite to eat a little before closing hours.Walking to the restaurant, it felt like a standard upscale Koreatown restaurant, very modern and clean with the motto of being healthy.I wanted something fall inspired, so the seafood pasta with pumpkin cream sauce was the winner for the night. My friends were nice enough to share some of their dishes with us, the pumpkin soup and the calamari. Not too sure if my pumpkin cream sauce was on the healthy side; instead of asking questions, I just enjoyed my plate of pasta, which was pretty fulfilling for one person. The pumpkin soup less sweeter than my cream sauce, and it tasted better if you scraped some of the kobocha meat into your soup. The calamari wasn't fried (something that I wasn't used to), but their take on the "healthy version" wasn't bad; personally, I think it lacked a crunchy texture.Overall, the place wasn't bad, and the price was a bit high for my wallet, but pretty standard for a venue that promote healthy eating. I would like to come back and try a few more dishes, maybe I'll find something reasonably price that taste just as awesome.OO! And they have sweets.. Too bad I was being good that night, or else I would have jumped into that gelato display..	1
1 star because of the atmosphere! But there are flies all over the food here. And the workers or owner do nothing. It&#39;s very unsanitary. And I have no idea what goes on in the kitchen. If they let flies all over the pastries and prepared salads what goes on in the kitchen?!	0
For cupcakes I definitely think they are as good as it gets! They are creative and always delicious. I've had lunch and dinner here. The menu is fabulous, the options are unique and fresh! The lemonade is home made and it is absolutely wonderful. The only bad thing I could say about this place is that they should get comfier chairs ;)	0
Come here for a cheap long island and a basket of cajun fries during happy hour on Friday afternoon after a long week in lab! You'll feel right at home amongst other lab rats doing the same.	0
I've always enjoyed the food at Cactus and the food tastes great _and_ is well presented. Personally I always look for some dish with mole although I've tried a wide assortment of meat and vegetarian dishes and they were all good.	1
I was yelping around and saw that purgatory pizza was a 4 star. It sounded interesting enough, so I drove down to first street and picked up a basic cheese. And it was not good at all. The problem was all in the crust. It was arguably the most tasteless crust I&#39;ve ever had. And it had the texture of paper. I will certainly not be back.	0
Went here 4 times  staying  at Caesars. They should be ashamed.1. Famous fried chicken comes out after 40 minute wait...slammed onto table and pushed in front of me pushing silverware way across table....ice cold.....could not find server...Manager at least got a hot over cooked dried out dish....she comp'd this non meal!2. My wife's scrambled eggs after 35 minute wait came to table with long black hair across it. Just took back... No apology! Wife did not eat. My omelet cold. 3 breakfast. My French toast warm after25 minute wait otherwise ok 4. Lunch today: lunch arrived after 30 minutes. What a joke! Wife order Chinese Chicken Salad: arrived with absolutely not one piece of chicken it.  Out came a thin burnt burger	0
Favorite spot for vegan pizza! They only take about 10minutes to make them and they even give you a side of barbecue sauce with no extra charge. We usually get 18&#34; Field of Dreams pizza: artichoke, vegan sausage, olives and daiya cheese. Scrumptious! A great place for hanging out with friends or on a date! They have both vegan and non-vegan options.	1
Okay place for a sandwich. Was never greeted by the staff. Cashier was more worried about checking her phone. The soda machine had about two options from the 100+ options. Management needs to revise their employees.	0
The food was decent, nothing special. Slight attitude from the server, though the busboys were friendly and attentive. Restroom was disgusting. Probably won't return	0
Happy hour is SO GOOD. I&#39;m super happy during those hours when I am here... The food/drinks have always been heavenly. Especially the fondue. The restaurant is always so dark though. Makes me feel weird a little weird ha	1
This place is amazing, but it always makes my coworkers and me breakout... Be aware!	0
it is a korean tradition where if you are single on valentine's day (2/14) and single on white day (3/14) -- (this is where the guy gets the girl a gift), then a bunch of folks get together on 4/14 and meet since it's a celebration of thee single folks ... this is aka as "black day" -- this is where all the single folks mooch off each other and eat jja jang mein together... it's actually quite fun, i've been part of this single bubble before and all you do is shit talk and drink and have fun.. anyways, this place sucks... again, why is it that i always end up coming to a korean place with a chinese guy? seriously, every korean joint i've gone to in san francisco has seriously been with a chinese guy... this just proves the general consensus that sf is just polluted w/chinese folks, which is not a bad thing since i love chinese guys:) (shut it dennis oppa!.. :D)their jambbong (spicy seafood stew w/all sorts of veggies clumped together $7.95) decent considering it's SF standards, but LA, and MY personal standards? not that great.their kambboogee (ew dude. this is a shame to the korean race, we can make better dishes than this kinda crap...) basically this is deep fried chicken w/spicy sweet sauce... i can't descirbe this; simply yuck. i only ate a few bites cuz it was in front of me... ($12.95)he seemed to enjoy it... :I *no comment*TIP: every wed, it's $4 off for seniors, and get this, you're not considered a senior under the western regulations where it's 55 & over, it's 72 & over ... LOL... crajee, dont cha think???	0
So... I love Slanted Door. I get it that this is the more casual sister restaurant. Love the ambiance/place was packed last night. Nice hostess sat us without a reservation after a bit of a wait. Had to ask her 20 minutes later to send over a server so we could order drinks (not an auspicious start). Wine keg apparatus was not working... Bathroom was dirty. Spring rolls were amazing as was the shaking beef. Brussel sprouts yummy. Glass noodles with crab were flavorless. Sweet potato dish very dry. Fried chicken dry too. Peanut butter pie at the end was ok. Server was very nice but not around much/restaurant seemed understaffed. Overall a disappointment.	0
Oh The Wood, you bum me out. I WANT to like you SO BAD. <br><br>Here&#39;s what&#39;s good:<br>the food...sometimes<br>happy hour<br>the location, location, location<br>tasty wine and beer selections<br><br>Bad:<br>the food...sometimes <br>the super slow service<br><br>Please, I beg you, try harder, take pride. You have SO much potential - great location, a yummy sounding menu, cool indoor/outdoor space, a firepit for goodness sake. Everything is lined up for awesomeness - help us like you. Good luck!	0
Thanks for letting us wait in a rather small line, get to the counter ready to order, and watch you repeatedly answer phone orders, not take ours and then tell us you&#39;re closing early. Assholes. <br>Small place, too. Few options.	0
Best subs I have found so far in So Flo. This is the first place I have been to where they chop tomatoes for the sandwiches. I like it even though it is a bit messier to eat. Small operation but busy, friendly and passionate. I have always had a good experience here. I usually go for a roast beef or cheesesteak. I have a lot of sun shops around me but always travel the extra distance when only a good sub will do.	1
Crappy expensive, dark and terrible food. $5.50 for parking. Not worth the trip.	0
Canter's is SOOOO good. It's also an LA legend. They have had tons of celebrities eat there. I was recently watching a TV show called Clark and Michael and they were sitting in Canter's talking about plans for a new TV series they were gonna make. This place is a money restaurant and features a bar with a live band. If your in LA this place is a MUST and if it's your first time going, get the Reuben.....enough said.	1
Amazing food and service! Have driven by this place for 20 years. Finally went inside to today to a great surprise. The owner Ali, as mentioned in previous post, is very attentive and sweet. The quality of the food is great.	1
This restaurant exceeded my expectations. The food, service, and ambiance were above par. I would highly recommend the shrimp appetizer and the duck confit entree.	0
the pastrami is incomparable to other places.i dont like pastrami but this place is the best	1
Small and quaint dining room on the second floor of the JW Marriott. There are about 7 tables in the elegantly decorated restaurant. My girlfriends and I came here to try their Miami spice menu. We were the only ones in the entire restaurant and felt as if we were in a private tasting where the chef was cooking solely for us. The Miami spice menu was nice. I highly recommend the roast over a bed of risotto. The chef stopped in to see if everything was to our liking. I love that. knocked a star off for lack of ambiance. Other than that, enjoyed our dinner here very much. Complimentary valet.	1
This place is iconic and every time I go here it just brings an "old school" type of feeling that I really do enjoy. Food is a classic jewish deli and diner food that you can't really find anywhere else. It's delicious, good, not quite good for those who are trying to be on a diet. I haven't tried the Matzo ball soup yet-----but I will next time!	1
You either have to be a midget or fetus to eat comfortably it&#39;s the size of a walkin closet. Tables are aprox 6&#34; away from the others. I cannot enjoy it	0
I&#39;m a subs girl, especially hot. Something about hot bread and meat with melted cheese and fresh chilled veggies just does it for me. Subs on the run has <br>THE best hot turkey sub I&#39;ve EVER eaten! Perfect in every way! All of them taste just as good as last. Can always count on them to have fresh meat, soft bread and crisp veggies. Fortunately, the sub&#39;s are so good you don&#39;t really focus on the service with a frown and semi- sketchy local.	1
Great service. Our waiter was absolutely amazing. He was attentive, but also respected that my girlfriend and I were having a serious conversation.	1
One would think that knowing a Film Independent at LACMA screening is happening and a 600 person theater is going to be sold out, like it always is on Film Independent nights, one would staff this place up and get it together! But no, waitstaff is always annoyed and understaffed, over worked and providing lots of attitude. Service is slow, food is slow - everything takes forever! Ray&#39;s Stark bar, please get your staff some help and capitalize on the traffic!	0
Food is good....if they get it right and on time. Order delivery at risk of hungry person anger. <br><br>Restaurant Initially confirmed delivery for 45 minutes from order, checked in with them 70-75 minutes later, told wait 30 more minutes, called back and it was about to leave, arriving about 2 hours from when I placed the order. <br><br>Once it arrived everything that I customized on the order was wrong (basic things like &#34;no sauce&#34;). Mind you it was ordered on eat24 so there was no confusion on the phone. <br><br>Called back and the person on the phones was rude, said they must have made mistake but didn&#39;t offer anything until I said to replace it, but even then my order was going to The back of the line with no estimated delivery time. <br><br>This isn&#39;t the first time the order has been wrong after giving fairly detailed/clear notes, but will be the last time we order delivery from here again!	0
This review is for service alone. If your bar is first come first serve, then one would think that one could grab one of the 3 open seats at the bar and they wouldn&#39;t be held for mysterious absent guests on a waitlist. Not how a restaurant bar should be run. Or if it&#39;s going to operate that way, at least make that clear on the website.	0
This place gets an unqualified amount of high ratings even though the food is tasteless and subpar. We ordered yesterday 3 dishes and one appetizer. The calamari had no taste, no salt added. Very bland. Same with the other 3 dishes. Sesame chicken that lacks crispiness and is severely flavorless? Gross. It was like long chicken strips glazed with no flavor sauce. I do not recommend at all! Mongolian Beef that really had no flavor. I mean absolutely no distinguishable flavor. I usually order from Ngs Kitchen but they were close on Tuesdays. Ngs actually puts flavor in their food and their sesame chicken actually has breading, crispiness and flavor. So so sad. Will not order again from this place.	0
I think you should go to this restaurant. Just know ahead of time that it's strange. The charcuterie platter was quite expensive for what it is, just a bit of meat, two kinds of cheese, blue and WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?!?!?	0
You can find the Thai-Korean style BBQ here. It is so good.. <br>I love its clean atmostphere here.<br>The owner, David, was very helpful. He suggested menu and brought the food for us. <br>WoW. The food has Thai taste with Thai-style service. I love it.<br>So if you have never tried Thai-style BBQ, here is a must-stop.	1
Best pan con lechon in the world, hands down.	1
This place saved my life. I was forced to travel via Greyhound due to last minute travel plans, and naturally had issues and had a 3 hour wait. Keep in mind this is a generally dirty part of LA, there are treasures to be found but its the industrial district. Its nasty. So I hop on Yelp, a few places are around but Little Bear catches my eye. As soon as I stepped inside I see that I made a good call. Very large and spacious building, a nice establishment across the street called the Bicsuit company which is pleasant to look at, and a list of rare, Belgian beers longer than your friends list. Score!	1

This was a huge disappointment. Not a single dish stood out and the service was poor.	0
Came here last night with a friend. The place is very tiny but has a fun vibe. Our waiter seemed a bit scatter brained but was very friendly and didn&#39;t mess up our order. Complementary bread was very stale. But our fried calamari app came out soon after and was delicious. I ordered the fettuccini al porcini and my friend ordered the tagliatelle with lamb ragu. Both of our dishes were delicious and very satisfying. I would definitely come back here again to try some of the other pastas.	1
Great food great service! Mint tea is on point and their sandwiches are pretty awesome!!!Thanks LA Cafe!Chris K.	1
Ok there were some good items. In fact my steak was excellent. But the salad orders were completely botched and the service was slow. Somehow in spite of some tasty menu items I came away feeling like I wouldn't go back.	0
It was a bit strange we had a 5:30 reservation. we were a few minutes early. there was one other couple seated eating when we arrived. We were shown to a table that was very small and in a very awkward position in relation to a wall that had a jog in it and was practically on top of the tables on either side of it. We asked to be seated at another table pointing to a table over two tables from where we were originally directed. The hostess said that table was already reserved for someone else. that's Fine there were at least 10 other open tables in the restaurant lets find another? She had to ask the manager if it was okay to move us to another table. found this a bit absurd. we were seated over a couple of tables from the original table this was fine. The waitress came over she was pleasant. She took our drink order then came back with some bread and some kind of spread placed it on the table and left we had to ask what was in the spread( it was pureed chickpeas) as she did not explain what it was, we had never been to this restaurant before so a little information about what was being put in front of us would have been a nice gesture. The food was very good, prepared well and all tasted good. I had the lamb shank it was delicious. My wife had the Eggplant encrusted in a pastry shell she enjoyed it as well. The Tuna tartar app was very good.  My first impression was not the best with this restaurant Not sure if I would come back.	1
A great place to celebrate our sons college graduation.   Food was awesome.  Relaxing atsomphere.	1
Two burgers and mac and cheese.<br><br>Service was good but the food was not. Burgers were too greasy.	0
ALL VEGETARIAN AND MOSTLY VEGAN	1
This place is awesome. I was skeptical at first because I&#39;m not usually the type of person who says &#34;Let&#39;s go out and get salads&#34;. I live within walking distance and wanted to give it a try. I came in on a groupon and have been back twice a week since. Everything is fresh and tastes amazing. Atmosphere is chill. Prices are on point and portions are generous. All the produce is local which is a plus. I would definitely recommend going here, you won&#39;t regret it.	1
Maybe my expectations were too high after last years rave reviews, or perhaps the business has gotten so confidant that their patrons would go back no matter what. This place has severely disappointed my gf and me on our recent visit this winter.<br><br>We got there and it is busy as usual since it was lunch time. Servers seemed stressed and distracted, but I won&#39;t rail them for that. We sat down and got our menus and it took forever to take our order (10-15 min). We ordered a Tom yum noodle soup and sticky rice. Note that we came in first and got our order down first in front of three other groups who sat down after us, yet they got their food first and ours arrived last after 10-15 min. Maybe they treat their regulars or Thai people better??? <br><br>So my Tom yum noodle soup was just what I expected, but the sticky rice was horrible. First of all sticky rice should be soft and easily chewable, but our sticky rice was hard to chew and majority of it still had rice uncooked!! Raw rice in our dessert? Wtf! So my gf went to the cashier to ask about it, and her response was &#34;no that&#39;s how it is supposed to be&#34; in a rude tone. I&#39;m sorry, but we have had sticky rice from many Thai places and I have friends who are Thai that I have asked and they all say that it is not supposed to be raw! <br><br>Servers are completely incompetent and rude. Total disappointment especially after our first few visits. Maybe they should hire that girl who first helped us and made this place our first thing to visit when we go to Vegas.	0
Everything was simply perfect.  The staff was very welcoming and friendly.  They really knew the menu and wine list and were able to make great recommendations.  My only regret was that I wasn't able to try more.  I will be back!	1
The food here was very good. We had the poutine - it wasn't called that on the menu, but it was fries, gravy and meatballs. It was really great! We also had the hummus and pita - good, but nothing special. The desserts were ridiculously good. The bread pudding and chocolate cake were particularly exceptional.The beer selection was also pretty impressive for such a small place. We'd like to go back for the $3 mimosa weekend brunch.The only negative that I saw was that there weren't a lot of seats. That could pose a problem for large groups or trying to eat at busy times.	1
I love this place. I hope that Benjamin will give it another try. I've never had to pay for soda refills and have never had a bad meal. This is my go to lunch spot. I can always count on them to have a delicious soup and the wait staff is very friendly and attentive. My favorite is the spicy oaf burger which I get as a veggie burger. It is a nice veggie patty with pepper jack cheese, jalapenos, and a spicy red pepper spread. The are served on the freshest ciabatta rolls that I've had since moving to Madison. A big plus for The Lazy Oaf is that you can substitute the fries with either a salad or soup.	0
Ate there 2 nights in a row. ...first night food and service were  great....service second night bumpy...But food was great though	1
Worst steak ever. Kona dry aged steak was awful. Ordered med rare and got med to med well. They said it was lighting and tried using a spot light to convince me otherwise. It was chewy as leather and there were tendons that were not melted in high enough heat. Go to grand lux instead for their ribeye or the food court next door.	0
I honestly cannot decide if LA Cafe is a 3 or a 4. Let me explain.When I first came into LA Cafe, I was ecstatic because of SO MANY CHOICES! I had the peppermint mocha and chili bowl and it was SO DELICIOUS. The snacks, drinks, food options....ugh everything just tastes so guilty and good. With that being said, if you happen to walk into LA Cafe for your first time...it's a solid 4. The servers are nice, the cafe is really chill, and the food looks and tastes awesome....and then you wake up the next day and realize that whatever you ate...was just SO BAD for your body. It's literally been two days since I was at LA cafe...and I am still so full. I even went to the gym last night and after working out hardcore for an hour, LA Cafe is still bogging down my system. AHHH!!I don't suggest eating here everyday.	1
Okay, when you're paying less than 10 dollars for two traditional rolls, you can't expect top shelf seafood so please, lower your expectations fast.	0
How much can you love a restaurant? Read my review and you'll find out.	0
Anthonys Coal Fire trumps Andiamo 10 fold. The pizza is ok. inconstant and the rudest owner I&#39;ve ever met. Will never go back	0
A memorable dining experience. The quality of the steak was outstanding.	1
You know me - I tell it like it is so I&#39;m not gonna lie. When I read about this place opening the article mentioned that the owner&#39;s intentions were to open a beer garden type place to attract the hipster crowd. So naturally I flipped out and began putting together an arsenal of hipster beating weapons while imagining emaciated 25-45 year old, bearded, standard-issue hipster kidults skipping and long boarding through Bay Ridge.<br><br>Well, after two visits this summer, I must say: apparently the BushPointBurg hipster fucks never made it. However there are a couple of hipster types on staff and the two times I was there, I did see some Park Slope yupster types who slithered in to live in Bay Ridge which is why I&#39;m taking away a star. You know the kind that have that smug, self-important, elitist force field arond themselves, their little brat and their 4-wheel drive Gravedigger stoller. You can always take the escape route to Kelly&#39;s across the street if it gets too unbearable for some $2.50 pints of Bud and real Brooklyn characters. But it shouldn&#39;t - there seems to be a balance of normal looking and acting locals. <br><br>The food was tasty and the beer I had was great - can&#39;t remember the name but some faux-beer enthusiast pretentious hipster would begin telling you how its &#34;artisanal and hand-crafted&#34; meanwhile its just fucking beer, bitch. Good tasting beer PERIOD.<br><br> If you are some Where&#39;s Waldo looking dweeb or some transient beardo who works in the imaginary saw mill of Brooklyn that employs all these faux-lumberjack looking douches and are reading this - STAY THE FUCK AWAY FROM BAY RIDGE.	1
Best craft beer selection I&#39;ve seen in the city! Great food, great environment, great service! I will be coming back my next time in Chicago.	1
One of the worst dinning experiences ever. The Maitre d was one of the rudest French snobs that I've ever came in contact with. I will go back but I'm def giving that guy the finger.	0
I came for dinner for the first time with my friends(5 of us) . We had amazing food, 4 stars for the food ... BUT wow service was very bad! And there are tip included 5 or more ..... My waiter name is Michael (tall guy with glasses) came to table like 3 or 4 times for entire meal, and I ordered something Togo with separated check with our dinner. Check came out with tip included on my Togo check , I asked him nicely that why my Togo had tip included he said it because of it s same party but i dnt think it s right to included tip on Togo order.... So I talked to manager and she took the tip off from my check .....BUT HE CAME AND THROWN THE CHANGE AT ME... 5 of us saw the same thing!!!!! Wow!!! Never experienced it in my life!!!!! Great food !!! Horrible SERVICE ... Never go back!!! Bye!!!	0
I love this place! I came here because I was in the mood for Thai and wanted to try a new place. Word of advice: if you want to try this place, dine in and don&#39;t order delivery. I think the decor and ambience of this place really makes your experience here much more enjoyable. The place is really quite nice and elegant. <br><br> We ordered chicken satay, tom yum soup and Panang curry. The chicken was so tender and fell off the stick! The tom yum soup was so rich and spicy, they pour the soup infront of you! Lastly, the Panang curry was quite good but not my favorite. <br><br>One extra star because of their playlist! They were playing late 90&#39;s early 2000&#39;s R&amp;B slow jams. My favorite! Definitely coming back :)	1
The food, wine are great! But the first class service from the owner, Thea, as well as the Cuban folklore band for the Supper Club Friday nights, make this one of my favorite restaurants in Miami!	1
although i love a good ambience, i rarely write about it or give a place extra points because of it. you might say, &#39;wait jonathan, Oomasa and good ambience? are you crazy?&#39;<br><br>Yes, good ambience, great even. Let me explain. Yes, it&#39;s a cross between a dive/hole in the wall and old school japanese traditional eating/drinking spot. Not trendy ambience, not modern ambience, not particularly orderly in any japanese clean and orderly sort of way.<br><br>No, by ambience i mean, it&#39;s kinda like a Japanese version of Cheers. with sushi and other tasty treats of course. The bar area at the far end of the restaurant is deceptively large, and yet the end near the bathrooms is seldom used for some inexplicable reason, especially considering the place is crazy busy on weekends, and has a steady but not so hectic flow of peeps during the week (and sunday nights, my fave time to go)...<br><br>the sushi bar chefs are the same ones every time i go in--the years go by, the irasshai&#39;s stay the same. it really seems like a place where everyone knows your name. the mood at the sushi bar is friendly with both the patrons and the chefs, a place where you can just chill and eat above average to at-times excellent sushi--and at least the variance never falls below above average. yes, i&#39;ve had better sushi in my culinar travels, but something must be said for the longstanding above-average sushi quality as a benchmark of consistency. And they don&#39;t rush you out, no matter how long the wait gets on weekends.<br><br>i highly recommend coming here on &#39;school nights&#39;, including sunday, b/c it&#39;s definitely a come right in and sit down right away thing, even though it should be medium crowded. <br><br>additional perks are: open late, VERY reasonable prices, good non-sushi food (though there are some heavy restrictions on what non-sushi foods you can eat at the sushi bar, with only slight allowances made on non-peak nights (i shit you not).<br><br>if you wanna have a warmer (in a friendly sense) feel, sit yourselves down at the stations of the older sushi chefs, if you can have that choice. they tend to be more laid back and funnier than the younger guys.<br><br>Oomasa, keep on keepin&#39; on being you. Dependable. Relaxed. Fun.<br>Timeless.	1
The best Fish Fry I have had. Good pieces of fish with a thin crisp coating. No skipping on the fish part. On Friday you can get All You Can Eat. The service was excellent and a great Irish atmosphere. Was dark and loud music is playing FYI.	0
A place that I strongly recommend!!! Love it so much, especially the oxen tail soup! Their Rice is mixed rice with white, red and brown rice, super healthy! Most importantly, it opens 24/7!	1
LOVED LOVED LOVED this rooftop location!! I had a blast meeting people and sipping cocktails. This looked like something out of a movie I swear. People having a great time socializing and drinking while the bright lights from the buildings shined out. There are two levels of enjoyment which is the restaurant and lounging area and above that is the bar and patio. I think the top floor is a bit more intimate than the bottom because its less noisy. The bartender did an awesome job getting peoples orders down and providing a great attitude during the heavy traffic of thirsty people.I totally recommend people coming here for drinks and just laying back to relax. This is an ideal place for people to bring their dates to! I will be coming back soon!!	1
Whenever the weather is a little chilly and i want something warm and filling, I&#39;ll go here. The restaurant is very spacious and bright and clean. You can see them cooking the stews toward the back too. My favorite is the galbi tang. The potato stew is alright. Too chunky and hard for me to eat too.	1
Very excited to have a tasty latin restaurant in the neighborhood. The hood already has Mexican food, so it&#39;s great that Havana Social brings Caribbean and Latin American flavors to the area. We enjoyed delicious arepas, empanadas, a pernil (roasted pork) bento box which included rice and beans and churros for dessert. If you&#39;re in the area, check out this new neighborhood gem! <br>p.s. they even gave use Mac n cheese empanada on the house!	1
Do not go to this place !!! <br>I went there on Thursday after I called and talked to Evan the manager that told me that no reservations needed and when I got there the doorman was rude to me and didn&#39;t let me in because it&#39;s &#34;reservation only&#34;... don&#39;t waste your time with going there.	0
We went to Lola the last time we visited Seattle from SF, as we were staying at the Hotel Andra (same building) and we tried the restaurant right after we checked in. We came back to Seattle almost three years later for another visit and tried it again w/our 2-yr old. It was just as good as we remembered. The Pita bread with the various dips are awesome and the kebabs are inventive and yummy. Both times we went when we weren't starving, so we haven't tried larger plates, but the service is great and the wine list has some great local choices. And they are very kid-friendly: it's noisy, so you don't have to worry about your kid screaming and disturbing others; they have a kid menu (w/kebabs!) and crayons; and the staff was very friendly to her as well. It's nice (and sometimes rare) when you can have a nice meal w/your spouse and child and not feel like you're retreating to the chain restaurants, especially when you're traveling.	1
Having just been to Langers for the first time about a week before I was not sure that Canters pastrami reuben would be able to compete. <br><br>Well, it was able to compete......it just lost. It was still a real good sandwich. Coleslaw instead of kraut. <br><br>Sandwich was slightly smaller than Langers and fell apart a bit while I was eating it. <br><br>I have no problem paying $13 for this sandwich at 3am.	1
I have been coming here on and off for the past couple of years and never have had a bad experience. They are a small eat in and take out restaurant. The staff is very friendly and quick with service. The have an extensive Manu and lunch/dinner specials. You need to bring a big appetite or some to share as their portions are very generous.the egg rolls, the lo mein and the honey garlic chicken are among my favorites. Kid friendly, parking accessible from the strip mall and seating area inside. Prices are decent.	1
So I was in Madison the other day picking up my carpooler near the East Town Mall and I admit....I was trying to find anything that would give me a caffeine buzz....okay I admit it, I was seeking out a Starbucks because at this point....Anything will do!!	0
I have tried the Churrasco the Picanha and the mash and corn and it was delicious the food doesn&#39;t take to long and its inexpensive.	1
This wasn't our first time dining/drinking at Crush, so we weren't expecting what happened. After being seated, our server came to take our drink order. We ordered a bottle of wine. We were told that they were out of that wine. We ordered another bottle of wine, the server came back and said they were out of that bottle. We tried a third bottle of wine... still we were told they were out. For being advertised as a Winehouse and it being NYE, one would expect they would have their wines by the bottle available. We finally were able to procure a bottle of Malbec, which wasn't by any means our first choice and was ok at best. We ordered a round of meats and cheese there were decent, but we also ordered two appetizers, the tuna tartar and the duck dumplings. The tuna tartar was far from fresh and filled with diced tomatoes which led us to two conclusion. They are filling the tartar with tomatoes to not have to use as much tuna and/or to mask that the tuna isn't fresh. The duck dumplings tasted as if they weren't fresh, but had been previously frozen. In the mean time our server was nice, but never once came to refill our wine glasses (I know it isn't a big thing, but if it is NYE and you pride yourself on being a nice restaurant, your customers shouldn't' have to consistently pour their own glasses.). We were able to finish the bottle of wine by the end of the appetizers which we didn't even finish and the wine had at least 0/4 of sediment on the bottom that we both choked on when we drank the last of our glasses. Check please! We had no interest in finishing our NYE night out at Crush. Needless to say we will no longer be patrons of Crush any more.	0
Really enjoyed my experience. Food was great; duck, octopus & oysters killed it. Nice wine selection, great easygoing Som to help you out with it. Atmosphere was awesome, outdoors but warm & rustic. Host was sweet & snagged us a great spot. Sever could have been a bit more attentive/personable but overall service was solid and we felt taken care of. Bussers/runners made sure we wanted not ;)A bit expensive but still felt it was a good value for the quality/ambiance.	1
My first time was last Saturday for lunch: grilled sardines and albacore salad with aioli dressing: a mix of warm and cold flavors with a zest of lemon in the sauce: Delicious!!!! The manager Martin (the guy with the cool watch) was very professional and attentive to detail and Brad came back a few times to the table to make sure that we were set on water and bread, Love the design of the place with the knife and fork in your own little drawer! ingenious...will definitely go back as often as time permits me to. Oh, I almost forgot, make sure to get the cheese tray.	1
I will have to admit, If you want real Mexican food in Las Vegas, El Gordo is the place. And yes it is way far from the strip. We literally walked down here from where we were staying at, but it was fun. Enchiladas, tiny mini tacos are the best. Taste real good as if you were in TJ or East L.A. My only annoyance is the huge crowd and some of the element of ghetto people it attracts. The place is big with a few tables and outside tables, but it can get really noisy when trying to order food. Chilli fries are really good, and i like the fact that i can watch the employees cook and prepare the food. Great place, i hope to come back on a less crowded night.	0
The staff was knowledgeable about what can be made gluten free - most of the taco options. And the tacos were delicious!	1
Amazing Galbi short ribs!	1
We went here for dinner and there was quite a wait so we decided to leave and find another place to eat only to come back to an even longer line. There is no hostess to ask you how many in your party but there are some numbers hanging in front right as you walk in so GRAB ONE! The food was decently priced about $14-$17 for a bento box. I ordered the Chicken terriyaki bento box; it came with miso soup, bowl of rice, chicken terriyaki on a small bed of salad, 2 pieces CA roll, 2 pieces sushi, 6 pieces sashimi, a bit of macaroni salad, and a bowl of green tea ice cream at the end. It tasted good (except for the green tea ice cream), lots of food, and okay priced. My boyfriend ordered the chirashi and was disappointed in how much sashimi you get compared to Sushi Gen down the street (it was too packed to go and they close kinda early for a Saturday night). Next stop Sushi Gen!	1
Wonderful food. Pork chop is amazing. Cooked sous vide and served with delectable sides. Every mouthful an adventure. The most melting tagliatelle bolognese that any restaurant in Emilia Romagna would be proud of. Cannoli to die for. Great coffee. Only negative was completely ditzy and distracted service.	1
Charged 3 dollars for a plate of lettuce my sister and I cancelled our orders and left. Never again	0
I gotta say, that this place made my day. After being irritated running late for work and unable to get a bite to eat before my shift, I found LA Cafe online and they deliver to my work address. $10.00 minimum, $3 delivery fee....most places have a $20.00 minimum. When I called I spoke with a James who was super cool and friendly. He suggested I get the lobster grilled cheese with a salad, which I did, and it was frickin bomb. He suggested I call the order in about 40 minutes before the time I actually wanted to eat the meal. They delivered during the first minute of my lunch break, so I was able to relish in the pure awesomeness of that lobster grilled cheese. Even the basic salad was super bomb. Would definitely recommend. Unless you are a high maintenance and impossible person, this place suits all walks of life. .	1
Best brunch in town! I love trying new places, and most of the time I'm disappointed by the food and the amount they give for the price. But Toast has the most amazing food, such good quality and they give soooo much food for the amount you pay. There are endless choices in the menu so it a perfect place to go with friends who are really picky. THey also have the best service! the waiters are always happy and bring your drinks and food out right away. I love toast!	1
It's orgasmic! Far bar Burger Nd Farbar Sushi Rolls	1
Sorry Lily R. It was I that was late and made her wait but it was only 2 hours which was nice for them so they can explore Seattle a lil bit. I didn't eat here with them but they had a couple slices left over and since I got off the plane starving like marvin, I devoured their left overs. The mushroom truffle oil pizza was my fave...they weren't button mushrooms but more like shitake mushrooms or some kind of long stemmed mushroom. While Lily R liked the margherite, I didn't like it too much. I usually do tho! The sausage pizza was good but nothing exiting. Reviewers, don't take my opinion too seriously because I ate cold pizza which equals cold cheese. I would have to try it again. I gave them 4 stars because of their crust. It was perfect for my taste.	0
Two words: the bomb. The bf and I love this place. It is literally the perfect burger. taste is amazing, the burger appears small on first observation, but don't let it fool you, it's the perfect size. So juicy. My socal burger is around 10 bucks, like most of the other burgers. Local is cute, parking isn't so hot, but who cares, the burger is so worth it. And the sweet potato fries are amazing, as is the brown sugar ketchup. Basically, I would have given a 5 star, but like my sister mentioned before, the seating blows. Unless you like sitting on cold, hard chairs. But it goes with the decor, so i'll let the hipsters have this one.	1
Been there twice now, I didn&#39;t write a 2-star review the first time because I figured it was only fair to give them another shot. Everybody has bad days, right? Seems more often than not at the Grove Spot.<br><br>I used to love going to Olav&#39;s little place next door. How could such a good thing go wrong?<br><br>Breakfast for me &amp; the wife was a 2 hour affair, with only 3 other customers in the entire Spot. The waitress was friendly and at the mercy of the slowest kitchen in the Grove. One side dish was omitted when the food arrived at our table, and she was berated by the owner right in front of us. How unprofessional, and uncomfortable. That&#39;s no way to run a business, and no way to talk to a person. Shame!<br><br>Coming back from the Arts Fest yesterday, we had a friend with us, and thought we&#39;d stop to quench our thirst before the walk home. Even though Happy Hour prices were posted all over, we were (quite rudely) informed that Happy Hour prices weren&#39;t in effect - and I can&#39;t make this part up: &#34;Because of the Arts Festival&#34;.<br><br>Again, I think this is the wrong way to run a business. Taking advantage of a local event to gouge customers is just plain unscrupulous.<br><br>As a local resident, I take pleasure in patronizing neighborhood businesses, but cannot see myself going back to The Grove Spot.	0
Excellent food at a great price. A must for anyone.	1
My husband and I went yesterday for our favorite sandwich as part of a final day of holiday feeding before we start a round of dieting before Christmas...<br><br>Our must have is a pastrami ruben with coleslaw instead of sauerkraut. Soooo yummy.<br><br>Also the coffee is fantastic and super hot. So appreciated. I think that I had the best service there that I have ever had!	1
Los Feliz, you never let me down girl! Vintage shops, Parisian cafes with wicker chairs on the sidewalk, bars from the 50s still in swing today, coffee shops established for the sole purpose of poking fun at Starbucks. I love it and Fred 62 really fits into this Neighborhood of Character. A diner with an old feel but in tune with the food cravings of the current times. Fried mac and cheese balls, hash browns on your breakfast sandwich (why not?), goat cheese and avocado as an additive if you so please, ice cream on your waffle. They've got it all. Unisex bathroom could smell less like a bathroom but that's all I've got in the negatives. Come during non-weekend, non-breakfast hours to avoid the madness.	1
Lasagne was perfect and my wife loved the chicken parma.  We sat at the bar and was waited on by Riley who was able to give great advice on menu selection.	1
Not too sure why the other reviews don&#39;t seem too favorable...<br>I&#39;ve been here several times and all of the dishes I&#39;ve tried were wonderful and tasty (galbi jjim, haemul kalguksu, ooguji galbi tang, etc.).<br><br>The service is decent, but honestly...one cannot expect a 5-star service at a small Korean eatery.	1
I don&#39;t recommend this restaurant the food was terrible ... Over cooked pasta and no salt ...	0
BEST!!!! I will now make Nanny&#39;s my first choice for a healthy place to eat fresh!!! Thank you all for you excellent food and service as you can tell your restaurant is Class &#39;A&#39; and affordable!	1
Cioppino's is this little piggy's go to special occasion restaurant. The food is delicious, the decor luxurious and the service is exceptional. Only one complaint, it is very expensive.	0
2 stars. what a diappointment. I was expecting really great deli food. Guess I got caught up in the hype of this LA legend. I ordered the corned beef and cabbage, which is a dish that I love but dont have too often. For some reason I have a hard time finding place that serve this dish. The corned beef tasted fine but man was it watery. I had a puddle of water on my plate. I guess they dont drain the cabbage when they plate. The corned beef was ok. Not the greatest and certainly not what I was expecting from such a well known deli. This was a disappointing meal. I wouldnt bother to come back. Too far from where I live and not worth the hassle.	0
Food: Tasty...but the service: TERRIBLEParty of 4: seated quickly with reservations, but waited AN HOUR for our food to come. Even then, my friend (it was his birthday) had a terribly dry pork tenderlion, which when asked by our waiter how things were, my friend indicated his dinner was awful, and the waiter replied" ehh ok??" as if he actually did not care at all. THEN we kept noticing how EVERY table...EVERY table was greeted and talked to by the chef...EXCEPT OURS. The chef cut their food, brought out their wine, swirled their dishes...and we sat and gawked at how great their service was compare to ours, where no one seemed to care we were there, much less celebrating. THEN dessert came, and our waiter DROPPED it on our table, then LEFT. HE DIDNT COME BACK. We just sat and stared at our dessert falling on our table. THEN our bill was charged $50 extra...we ordered the prie fix and they added our desserts ON TOP of that...what the???SO to top it off, we asked to speak to a manager, who conveniently was not there, and we politely conveyed that we were treated unfairly, to which they (surprisingly) did not seem to care. DO NOT COME HERE. As "equal" as they care to say they are, this play definitely discriminates. No pleased. Terrible birthday dinner. We told our friends to cancel their reservations too.	0
Ok, my daughter lives in Seattle and when we visit this is one of our favorite spots. The chicken thigh sandwich with the caramelized onions is out of this world. Yes, the sandwich is very sloppy but I didn't care. Yes, we waited on a line for about 15 minutes, again we didn't care it was well worth the wait. There are only a few tables to sit down and eat, again I didn't mind we ate in our car, lol. Please take note for those who don't live in Washington, they do not except credit cards, bummer because I hate carrying cash. All in all we love this place!	0
Situated behind LACMA&#39;s famed &#34;Urban Light&#34; sculpture is the recently opened Stark Bar, which is a fab addition to the museum. Even on a chilly night, you&#39;ll still feel nice and toasty while lounging in the open-air bar. They&#39;ve got heat lamps surrounding the uber hip mid-century mod lounge furniture. Ray&#39;s is the restaurant connected to it - both named after the late great producer of films like Steel Magnolias and Funny Girl. <br><br>Though they abide by the KISS method (keep it simple, silly) of cocktails their drink menu is pretty complex. You&#39;ll find cocktails named after Mr. Stark&#39;s films on the menu like Little Annie and Owl &amp; Pussycat. The Ginger Rogers was a popular drink amongst our group - the mojito-like cocktail is made of gin, freshly squeezed lime juice, ginger, mint and ginger ale. If you&#39;re hungry, there&#39;s a nice little bar bites menu with tasty flatbreads. <br><br>Stark Bar is great if you&#39;re just looking to have a chill night out with a date or a group of friends. Because the bar closes at 11pm, you&#39;ll want to make it a pre-party spot or just call it an early night after some yummy cocktails.	1
The service is horrible - so first time there, the restaurant was packed but no other people in line. No one, I repeat, no one greeted me at the door, so I finally walk in after waiting for 20 minutes and ask one of the girls how much longer was the wait. She said maybe 10 minutes........ 15 minutes go by and she walks up to this piece of paper taped to the door and calls out a name. I say, excuse me, I have been here for over 35 minutes and never once did you tell me to sign in on a piece of paper taped to the door. She looks at me and says, "oh, you must sign paper"...duh??? How am I supposed to know about the paper if no one tells me??? So I left.Typical, rude chinese attitude. Word of advice to you people - greet your customers and advise them of the process!	0
Go here and order everything. You won&#39;t regret it.	1
So So - Greek food... I have had better in smaller joint across town... not bad if you are on their side of town - light fare... Was looking for the Wow factor - did not find it... nothing wrong with the food - just average...<br><br>your constant companion,<br><br>~deirdra	0
My boyfriend and I went to Perch last night and we absolutely loved it!! Tiffany, the hostess made our experience a lot more pleasant. She had two rose tatoos near her collar bones. She was very sweet and sat us in a very good table. My boyfriend ordered the steak frites. It was very tasty and tender. The fries had yummy gooey cheese. I ordered the My Fair Lady drink, it was a bit on the sour side. After dinner Tiffany went out of her way to seat us putside bc we wanted to have dessert outside. Overall we were very happy with the dinner, ambiance, and most importantly Tiffany&#39;s hospitality. :)	1
This place is gross! The carne asada meat is horrible... You&#39;re basically eating tortillas with nothing but nerves, skin, and fat. I guess you get what you pay for... Never will I come back again.	0
We came on a wednesday night. Its nice inside, dark colors, a lot of wood. Theres a bar by the entrance with some tables. One entire wall of the dining room is a wine rack. The tequila sunrise could have been stronger. They give you 2 different sides for the bread and butter. Everything was totally delicious!<br><br>For appetizer we started with provolenta parril. We&#39;re cheese freaks and this was a toasty cheese fabulosity! Had asparagus soup and squash soup. OMG the serving is massive and they were both the yummiest ever, especially the squash...wow. My husband had bone-in ribeye with veg, huge, he brought most of it home. It was great but at $39.00 I think its too much. I had spinach and ricotta empanadas. They were oven fresh, toasty and puffy, I could only fit one! Soooo scrumptious! <br><br>The service was fine, the servers know what they&#39;re talking about, but they took forever to take our drink order. We saw the people next to us order something they flambe at the tableside. Too bad we were too full for dessert! Have to come back. Total was $153, had 2 rounds of drinks. Kinda meh with that price but maybe cuz of the spot, food is worth it. Surprised to find such a nice spot on Bird but you have to park by Bird Bowl or the supermarket. Everything in front of the restaurant is valet...dumb!	1
What a great new addition to the Chinatown neighborhood! Adding diversity to the food of Chinatown is very much welcome. We have been keeping an eye on this place as we take our dog for a walk, waiting for it to open up since we moved into the neighborhood.<br><br>When I walked in, I was instantly greeted by the old timey music they have playing, and the staff was super nice and helpful.<br><br>I got a shrimp po boy on deliciously soft bread with coleslaw, tomatoes, and pickles inside. I also got a bag of voodoo chips (I love me a bag of funky flavored chips).<br><br>While waiting for my food, I was able to wander around their market area and saw great mixes and other treats. They even do freshly made sausages.	1
Do not be put off by the location, as this restaurant is five-star quality. Exemplary service, delicious food and drinks, as well as a very friendly and cosy eating environment! They strive to make you feel at home. Highly recommend the &#34;Tree in the Pot&#34; desert.	1
Took my girlfriend there for dinner on a Saturday night. Overall, dinner and service was good, not great. However, I eat out a lot and for me to say good is just that. I would definitely return. My GF ordered a salad and two different appetizers for dinner, I can't remember what both of them where but she ordered the mussels which were bad. Not a big deal...these things happen and once we pointed it out to the waitress, they were taken away and removed from the bill. The manager stopped by to apologize and while it was appreciated, it wasn't necessary. As I said, things like that happen with shell fish. To be clear, when I said they were bad, they were BAD as in not fit for consumption. I had the quail and it was delicious. I also had beef short ribs for the entree and it was fantastic. What I really like about the place is the low mark up on wines. We had a 2006 Pride Cabernet and it was priced just barely above retail. Being a wine geek, I can't stand paying 300% markups on wine. Anyway, I would recommend this place to others and will return.	1
Kind of a bummer. As the only game in town (immediate area) I had high hopes for Dekalb Restaurant, especially since at first glance it&#39;s a really beautiful space. The front room is what sells you: open and airy, big communal dining table, well kept bar. It feels very welcoming, like a European cafe. The main seating area is a bit drab since it&#39;s in the back of the restaurant with much less natural light. The service was average at best. The bartender glanced at us when we walked in and then ignored us until the servers reappeared. They were training a waitress when we visited, which is fine, but neither the trainer nor the trainee had much gusto and when I asked what the happy hour wine was they both seemed totally thrown for an answer beyond there being a &#34;red&#34; and a &#34;white&#34;. <br><br>Which brings me to the food, which was probably the biggest let down. The happy hour is a bit lame, $1 off two house wines and their beers, none of which I was terribly interested in. We came for dinner and ordered the gnocchi and the veggie burger. The gnocchi is a significantly smaller portion than other entrees and the flavors were confused and bland. There was what appeared to be deli mustard in the gnocchi sauce, which in addition to the gigantic slab of tough and chewy mushroom on the plate, was really not working. The veggie burger was gray, mushy, and flavorless. They also have no mayonnaise, which the burger really could have used and is in general just a little weird right?<br><br>I would maybe give it another try for a drink or small bite, mostly just because sitting at the front communal table seems like it would be pleasant. Unfortunately, not interested in another dinner.	0
The BEST Fried Chicken. period. I am totally hooked. The downside is.. parking sucks. small dining area. it takes 15-30 mins to prepare your order.	1
Now personally, I don't know what everyone is raving about. My burger was weak, the fries were mushy, and my apple pie was COLD. Freezing. I'm pretty sure the vanilla ice cream on top was the only thing heating it up. The food is gross, the service isn't much better and they only take cash. Also, there is only seating at the counter, so you can kiss any kind of conversation goodbye. The only part I liked was the jukebox.	0
Poor service terrible food. I will not return. Avoid the jerk chicken and shrimp pasta; both entrees have no flavor.	0
Portion size warning!!!	1
Terrible set up and not enough seating. If you order food, there&#39;s a good chance you won&#39;t have anywhere to eat it.	0
Food was ok not great but a nice change with the small salads being a good serving and very fresh. Nice courtyard to sit in on a nice day. Some of the mains do seem a little expensive though on the menu.	1
The &#34;date&#34; tables by the window have the most comfy plush chairs. Oh I could have stayed there all night. Oysters and whiskey. Pickles and Bourbon. What a wonderful way to start a weekend.<br><br>And the servers were great. They asked us to move so they could accommodate a party of six. And then gave us complimentary shots! And whenever we wanted more to eat or drink we didn&#39;t have to work to wave someone down.<br><br>The only downside was the highway/traffic noise. Only downside.	1
Rude server, wrong hours on website, wrong hours on yelp...to many great restaurants to put up with this place.	0
So this restaurant is right next to where I live and I literally started jumping on one foot when I heard that a sushi place was opening up near me. See I&#39;m a big sushi lover, no scratch that I&#39;m sushi obsessed! <br><br>This place is pretty good, they have a pretty big variety. Only problem I have is that almost 95% of thier rolls have shrimp in it. I&#39;m allergic (read deathly allergic, anaphylactic) to shellfish so I have a hard time find something I can eat here. They do have a roll called a Churassco roll which is delicious and unique. Their thai donuts are also A+ material.<br><br>Overall this place is good and definitely a must go if you&#39;re in the area	1
Has a really bad experience today at the Grove, and I Blame the staff.First off, the waiters are rude when they are walking around the place. I know the place is small but no need to push and scream. Maybe a certain notion or saying something in a nice tone would be more friendly.Then we ordered our food, and waited around 20 minutes. Then there was a power outage. A waitress come to our table and says " what have you ordered cause our system is down"I tell her and she says " that isn't fm going to happen" and didn't have a resolution. I asked for good option or a refund. I was given the refund option.Then they didn't have the sun of what I have paid: I told her the amount. She comes back with less money claiming that I had the amount wrong. I asked her to prove it and then she goes back and gives me the correct amount. First they have zero trust in their customers, very rude staff, and not very considerate in unfortunate situations. Everyone can run a restaurant , but dealing with situations like these shows the staff and managements readiness.Very disappointed knowing that this place has good food but not the best staff.	0
When this place first opened up, I was skeptical because I had heard it was a seafood place, and I&#39;m not a fan of seafood. Also, they replaced Indie Burger in this location, and I liked that place. I was easily won over on my first visit, and found plenty to eat that wasn&#39;t fished out of salt water.<br><br>The staff here are extremely friendly, even when the place is packed and the pace behind the counter is frantic. The dining area does get full in the evenings, especially weekends, but in the summer, there&#39;s nice outdoor seating as well.<br><br>The tacos are absolutely packed with flavor, but they&#39;re really tiny. Order a few of them if you&#39;re trying to get full. Burgers and fries are excellent too, and the burgers are plenty big and well-dressed.<br><br>BIG &amp; little&#39;s is a more than worthy replacement for Indie Burger, but I really miss the former&#39;s milkshakes. If this place starts serving milkshakes, they&#39;ll be perfect.	1
First thing that stood out to me were the self-serve carafes of non-bitter green tea on every table. +1	1
The nitty has good food and is great for birthdays, but it's not exceptional. The food is overpriced, and they charge 18% gratuity on every check, which is fine as long as you're getting great service. Like I said its awesome for birthdays (free drinks) but it's more of a tradition than a choice.	0
Wexler's is boring and trying to be clever. They need to come up with a better menu and bigger portions to compete with Wayfare Tavern next door, which is always packed and need weeks in advance to get a Friday or Saturday night reservation. Was at Wexler's on Friday night and there was no wait with empty tables. If this doesn't tell Wexler's to spice things up a bit, they'll be cooked.	0
I love this place and the idea of it its shear contradiction (organic ingredients organic palm oil but still a sweet treat).	1
The service is terrible!!! The guy in charge skipped some people when they stand in the line waiting to be served. I think the staff there think they are the GOD. Customer has to worship them. <br><br>Soup is very very salty. <br><br>Bad bad experience. We will never come again.	0
The first two times I came here the fish tacos were out of this world. The last two times- not so great. But everything else has always been top notch. This little mom and pop shop is like a chipotle in that everything you order is made right in front of you. Love that we can get a real Mexican coke here too. The best part about this place? A family of 3 can get a good meal for under $20.	1
Kien's been craving it n I know Jon wouldn't say NO... plus it's on our way anyway soooo... got it! =DWe ordered to-go... they now serve alcohol... awesome! Perfect pairing for their burning hot wings!!!Valet parking... although, we normally just park on the side out of the way and let the valet guys know we're ordering to-go... no prob...Ordered on the counter... a bit expensive for about $1 ea wing. Half n half - garlic soy + hot wings = ohhhh sooo yummy goodness! We couldn't help ourselves, we ate a couple on our way home... haha our lips r burning hot n we don't have anything to drink...As soon as we got home, we devoured each n every wing... they didn't stand a chance... eventhough our lips r burning... this time we have iced cold beer handy to cool us up... LOLClean facility n we didn't really wait that long...	1
Westwood's Apple Pan serves up the best burger experience, West of Beverly Hills. The menu is incredibly simple - a couple of burgers, fries, pie, and drinks. If you're looking for a kick-ass meal on a Friday night, try the Hickory Burger with Fries, a creme soda, and a slice of their mind-altering Banana Creme Pie. Apple Pan's no-frills atmosphere will grab you as soon as you walk through the small wooden doors facing Pico (near Westwood Boulevard). There are no tables at Apple Pan -- just one long continuous bar that wraps around the master bedroom sized dining room. One of two bartenders will take your order and the team behind them goes to work building your burger as carefully and slow as construction on the 405. The fries and drinks will usually come right out so you'll have something to nosh on while your burger cooks on the open air griddle at the center of the room.Above all, the Banana Creme pie is my very favorite thing to get. It came on recommendation from one of the waiters and I've never looked back to the apple pie since. Layer upon layer of luscious fresh banana slices mixes perfectly with a mound of banana creme under a whipped topping. Mix all that with a to-die-for buttery crust...and...well...the only way to understand it is to go there and try it. Please, go there and try it.Some words of advice: The Hickory Burger is best eaten hot, so make sure you eat-in at Apple Pan (I took Apple Pan to the Pacific drive-in once, but this food is best fresh). What makes Apple Pan most special is the crowd of regular Angelenos that fill the bar stools everyday. They're what makes this place such a quintessential diner experience -- well them and the awesome red plaid wallpaper.	1
Extremely well priced-fantastic menu. We had a wonderful dinner meal,. Service was excellent!	1
Its popularity is exceptional, but not sure why. The food ranges from OK to bad, and don&#39;t expect any consistency. The service is FAR from good: the hostess is typically rude and the waiters are kind of weird. Their little shop with pre-made foods is not of very high quality and the items are overpriced. There are definitely places in LA with a similar vibe but far better quality (e.g., try Joan&#39;s on third for a cafe + food store combo).	0
This place was amazing. <br><br>It&#39;s located in the Pershing Square Building on the 15th and 16th floor. 15th is where the restaurant is located but the 16th, the lounge area, is where you&#39;d want to be. <br><br>Great 360 degree view of the city, decent specialty cocktails (I had the My Fair Lady) and overall pretty cool vibe.	1
We made last minute reservations and happy we did. The food &amp; service was excellent. The Owner Ron was very personable and showed us arond the Inn which is always a great feeling.	0
Authentic food from Spain. Great atmosphere and flavor!	1
If I could this restaurant a no stars I would. I have traveled the world &amp; eaten at some of the finest restaurants. Never have I seen such a rude staff. The view is not worth enduring the attitude we received when paying over $300 before a tip. Thanks but no thanks.	0
I found this place by chance while taking a stroll in the city. I was thinking an ice cold beer and a small sandwich would be a perfect afternoon snack. Much to my chagrin no beer or wine here so I settled for a pork sandwich and a glass of water. The pork was not as hot as it should have been and just lacked "something". Maybe it needed more aioli and a squirt of suracha. The staff was friendly and the vibe was good.	0
Lately the service and food has suffered tremendously. Most of their sausages are far too salty and their sides all need an overhaul as well. I do not recommend this restaurant to anyone unless you are looking for a decent patio and a pint.	0
Tried each dish on the special Prix fixe menu- lovely.	1
I've been here a couple of times for lunch and for dinner. The food has always been good, the service has been really good. It is a bit spendy for what you get and the interior is a little over the top, but I've been there three times so far so that hasn't stopped me.	0
Came here based on reviews . The lady and I&#39;m guessing her daughter that was working there are VERY nice . Service was fast and attentive on whenever we asked for things . Let me start off with the broth of the pho. It felt very clean and non oily. The soup wasn&#39;t as flavorful as I expected it to be but in general it was still enjoyable. Came out nice and hot and the noodles cooked perfectly. Also gave us extra items on the house . Found my new pho fix in ktown . Also almost forgot the jangpong that they have there is delicious and also felt very clean. Portion is huge!	1
Food was bad. Poach eggs were cold. Slab bacon was misleading, they served thin cut bacon and called them slab bacon. Food was bland too. The hostess was not even friendly. Time for McD after brunch. <br><br>The waiter, Jonathan, was extremely friendly and attentive. The 2 stars were for Jonathan, food gets zero star.<br><br>My friend said Jonathan is &#34;comel&#34;.	0
We wanted a restaurant that was not a Pub or Asian, and had more than pub food and this Stephi's menu was great. We enjoyed the great selection of dinner salads and the clam chowder was thick and delicious. We did find the prices a little high but overall all the experience was good and exactly what we were looking for.	1
I went to this incredible restaurant with my friend Erik (who also wrote a review!) and the food was tasty and very good.	1
$11 for dinner. Cheap typical american buffet fare. Not much more to say.	0
This is the worse King of Thai Noodles that I've been to. I like lime, and the noodle I ordered comes with lime. Their lime had 1 drop of juice in it. I asked for another lime, another 1 drop. I asked for a lime that's more "juicy," they ended up giving me one small plate with limes. Each wedge this time had plentiful of juices and was enough to finally go around w/ all my friends. The bill comes, blam, $3 charge for a small plate of lime? Give me a &*$%ing break.	0
Great view!<br>Great seafood but the menu isn&#39;t very exciting...no bone marrow, no raw beef in any form, all the dishes are &#34;safe&#34;.<br>There were frog legs, but I didn&#39;t care for it much.<br><br>The Bouillabaisse and the Moules were delicious!<br>The escolar was a bit disappointing. It was a bit dry and the sauce it came with was too thick...it reminded me of gochu jang (korean red pepper paste).<br>Truffled fries...waste of belly space imo but my friends enjoyed them.<br><br>Whiskey on the rocks...is whiskey on the rocks. haha<br>The ice was melted alot the second time around. <br>Couldn&#39;t get sangria...I guess it&#39;s a brunch thing only.<br><br>We were there 7:30pm on a Friday night with a reso. Didn&#39;t have to wait a second. :)<br>Service was ok in the beginning but got really slow by the end of the night.<br>That&#39;s ok b/c my friend was feeling real good that night and started dancing the night away...oh pat~~<br><br>The best tip you will ever get:<br>The tables by the windows/doors inside between the patio and the inside of the resto is the most perfect spot.	1
Wonderful food and atmosphere! The grilled octopus appetizer is fabulous as is the skirt steak. Of course the frites with the garlic are a must. The house dressing for the beet salad used to be better but it&#39;s still fine.	1
This place is THE best hole in the wall cafe. <br>They have everything you ever dreamed of... for lunch. <br>Good meat, good cheese, good people, good ... you get the idea.<br>PLUS! They have a whole wall full of candies! CANDIES! SODA CANDIES to gummies to oddly small pieces of black balls that&#39;ll blow your mind because its so weird honestly... but its a trip trying out all the different kinds of candy they have there. <br>Occasionally they would have desserts too. &amp; what&#39;s good here? EVERYTHING. no joke. you have to try their dark chocolate bars too in the mini-mart section. OMMYGOODNESS it&#39;ll blow your mind out, so out of this world... not reallly but its SUPER delicious. <br><br>Candy: a biit pricey but I&#39;m always coming back for more.<br>Chocolate: depends what you get but the expensive stuff, the really good stuff, is worth every penny.<br>Deli: CHEAP! you can get a 1/4 lb of your choice of deli for about $2.50! and their meat is so good!<br>Sandwiches: again just choose anything or ask for reccomendations, you&#39;ll never be failed. <br>people: they are the sweetest people you&#39;ll ever meet, always delighted to meet to and hella bright and happy people. They at least brighten up my day for lunch <br><br>Check it out! NOW!	1
It's one of those places that makes you feel good about finding. Quaint neighborhood, cozy yet comfortable nicely done restaurant, unique/good food and drinks. They make a great tomato-olive oil spread served with the bread. Ordered a yummy martini... but seemed small for the $$. Variety of beers and wines... the red blend was great! We shared a couple of first courses to try their specialties. Shared a main course of Chicken under a brick with mushroom risotto that was wonderful.	1
Everything I&#39;ve had is excellent. My personal favorite is the ham and cheese croissant. Incredible! <br>I&#39;ve read the other reviews and yes, not everything can be the best, but my family has eaten at GC over 20 times and I can honestly say this place is worth 5 stars.<br>Yes lights are a bit bright for me and the place could use more warmth inside but I still come back for the friendly service, and delicious food.	1
My kind of place.	0
Had a great experience here.Nice modern space, but don't expect a small intimidate restaurant. This place is big.Favorite dishes: cauliflower nachos, ceviche negro and dorados tacos. I suggest you skip the mushroom taco. They only have one item on the dessert men, the flan, but it's definitely worthwhile. Wouldn't preferred it without the orange slices. Still, very good.Only negative comment: our service was slow the night we went.	1
Weary and I got off on the wrong foot when I tried to order an iced coffee at brunch and was told they had coffee, they had ice, I could make it myself. Woah, woah, woah... a simple we don't do espresso and we don't have a cold brew would have worked. But it's close, a slew of friends have urged me to get back there, and last month I did. And since then, I've been back about four times! Mostly for drinks at the bar, which in my opinion is the best place to sit there. But I've also had dinner and have to say I'm a pretty big fan! It's bananas from about 6:45-8:00, so if dinner is your idea, get their early. Otherwise if you just want to gab, go there a little later in the night. And if wine is your thing, they have some of the cheapest (and best) wines by the glass in Madison.	0
The menu is limited and the mac and cheese wasn&#39;t even that good. Disappointed I waited so long to try this place!	0
No surprise that the pizza was phenomenal...it&#39;s Michael! His food always amazes!<br>At Pier 6 there is fine food, a spectacular venue and a staff that could not be more accomodating! Denise-thank you for the perfect party; everyone was so impressed. I know you will be seeing them again and again.	1
Aida has a new chef, and I like the dishes I've tried that he's added to the menu. There's a small entree option, which I like. My husband's salmon and my scallops were perfectly cooked.	0
The drinks are great, especially the margaritas. The food is tasty and ideal if you like sharing. I would give 5 stars but the menu is a little limited in my opinion, good food, cool place and definitely worthy of a visit.	1
The Reuben and the salads were great, all the food has a farm to table feel, comfortable place to eat... Excellent service!	1
I had a really fantastic brunch experience here. I went a bit earlier on a Saturday morning (11AM) and the moment I walked in, I felt like I made the right choice. Unlike so many brunch spots in Williamsburg and Downtown Manhattan, anywhere you sit in this joint gives you tons of space to spread out and have private conversations with your group. My group chose to sit at the bar because the bartenders and owner (Adam) were all very charming and good looking. The menu was infused with Southern-style staples and the cocktails were no joke. We all ordered something different and the portions were huge so we shared. Everything was equally top notch. Definitely will make plenty of stops back here. The beer selection appeared to be great as well. Oh, and everything is far more reasonably priced than most joints in this neighborhood. Go there right away if you&#39;re even thinking about it.	1
THIS PLACE IS THE TRUTH. THANK YOU, BASED GOD. <br><br>Never again shall you be disappointed by Oaxaca, Villa Pancho, and all the other Mexican food pretenders.	1
Best falafel,<br>Best hummus,<br>Homemade focaccia,<br>+ I had some inventive soups that were A++.	1
I&#39;m here all the time for the egg sandwich. It&#39;s not so much an egg sandwich as a nice fluffy omelet, loaded with herbs and cheese, layered with tomato and arugula on rosemary foccacia. For $5. The coffee always tastes freshly made, and the servers are attentive and friendly. If they ever have a special of the day, order that, because it&#39;s always been great when I&#39;ve tried it.	1
WOW sooo overrated. The food here is not that good! The beef was dry. The rest of the dishes were pretty mediocre. The crab was decent but nothing to die for. And they only gave forks to the few Caucasians at the table? What the hell is that all about? I made reservations for a table of 12 and we were seated right away so that was easy. But I definitely would not come back here for Chinese food.	0
So there are like a ka jillion reviews of this place so Ill keep this short. I recently fell prey to my own weakness for sugar and went on a quest for the a good banana cream pie. Many places have too few bananas. I don't want monkey amounts but one slice of banana per 2 square inches is much too few.Some joints have too much whipped cream. While most nights I can be found on my couch suckin on a can of the stuff, I don't want it drowning my pie (that's not what she said =D)The Apple Pan had the holy grail of BCP! A generous amount of bananas and a happy balance between the cream and pie filling. I ordered to go because A) I didn't want people judging me for eating more than 3 slices and B) It's hard to find a seat straight away on a weekend night. C) The pie is not at all soggy so it can travel well.Yay for banana cream pie at the Apple Pan!	1
if youre feeling bougie and want some healthy looking food that tastes like money this is place to go. theyre generous on the portions at least.	0
flavorful spicy and not too heavy vegetarian curry	1
Ehh, I wanted to like this place more, but I just wasn&#39;t feeling it. They barely have a wine list to choose from, their menu is tiny, and the food was just meh. <br><br>I had the tilapia on top of a salad, but the &#34;salad&#34; was literally lettuce and 2 slices of tomato. NOTHING ELSE. What?! strange. <br><br>the house pickles we shared were gross--it was picked string beans, hot peppers, and carrots--not what i expected and not very good. <br><br>no desire to come back here really, unfortunately.	0
surprised i've never been here beforeduring the last three years living right across the streetdidn't get the sushi this time just one nikudon (beef bowl) and lunch combinationthe food was all pretty goodand surprisingly reasonably pricedthe place was also packed to the gillseven at 3pm on a sundaywill definitely be back to try the sushi	1
The Six Burger is the best burger in West LA. Coupled with handcut fries and mello decor, I&#39;ll be back for more.	1
I only got a coffee here (pretty good) but my buddy, who lives in the hood, swears by the place--especially the sandwiches (which have a Mediterranean bent). The setup is interesting-- a deli counter in the back, a long communal table in the center for the WiFiers (smart), and a few dine-in tables by the window.<br><br>One bit of decoration advice: Time to get rid of those cardboard boxes on the shelves against the wall. You guys moved in, so make yourselves at home!	1
I order from here all the time they deliver quick and the food is always yummy and consistent! FIVE STARS :)	1
Treated my boyfriend here for his birthday dinner since I had a few recommendations from friends to come. We valeted the car and took the elevator up. We had a 8:00 reservation but the host mentioned it may be closer to 8:30 if we wanted an outdoor patio seat. Went up to the rooftop, which was absolutely breathtaking and got two of their signature cocktails.At 8:20, we got a text saying that our table was ready and we got quickly sat outside with a view of downtown. We started off with a bottle of wine, octopus, and tuna tartare. I got the salmon entree and boyfriend got the lamb ravioli. Portions were smaller than may have been expected for that price point, but it was totally delicious and worth it. Upon hearing that we were celebrating a birthday, our waitress brought out a complimentary dessert.In short, Perch has absolutely beautiful views and the ambiance is amazing. The live band contributed to the evening. I would definitely love to return when I am not shouldering the entirety of the bill.	1
What a bummer! This place used to be great.Its clear that Suzu Noodle House has had some changes. I don't know if its a new owner, management or chef but what ever it is...it's NOT working. Suzu used to be my family's "go to" place for ramen when in Japantown. What we were served was mediocre at best. The bright fresh vibrant ingredients have been replaced with bland, boring, blah. Ever since I read David Cheng's inaugural issue of Lucky Peach magazine devoted entirely to the art of ramen I've been searching for the perfect bowl. Suzu was never the perfect bowl but a least it was tasty. So bummed! If anyone has a good recommendation for ramen in Japantown (or any where) please let me know.	0
i waited till i didn't have to wait in a line around the block. boy am i happy i wasn't one those fools. if you like this pizza you like Domino's, not that is the worse it just aint the best.4 or 5 pizzas of all the same ilk, they don't slice it and even though they warn you on the menu they give you a dull serrated butter knife so you can tear it to shreads. what the appeal of this place is i don't understand or maybe just maybe all the hype and the lines we a very very good PR ,move. either way the place is so overrated i cant believe it will last. i don't mean that in a mean way like i hope it fails. i don't want any small business to fail but i hope if they care enough to read yelps they will get off their high horse and simply serve some quality pizza at a decent price. for thin crust, Lu Lus for thick Little Star or lets face it a dozen other options in the city with out the overblown coolness.the space very cool looking and since i didnt wait in line the service although a bit confused was not horrible.	0
Service staff let us waiting for more than ten minutes to take our order, restaurant was 30% full, they were laughing and having fun among themselves. Burgers were super overcooked, and totally blend.<br>I used to come quite often but looks like this place is not the same.	0
The food was good and I would recommend the rolls	0
I went here for my birthday dinner while in Vegas . I made a reservation for 730 and was immediately seated next to a table of 4 older gentleman who were loud and abrasive. They were there eating because they won big on the football game which I could care less about. I tried to ignore them over the awesome Classic rock that was playing in the background but could not. They were so derogatory I just wanted them to leave. our server was prompt courteous and helpful . We ordered a field greens nothing special salad, split the pappardelle bolognese and I got the veal chop. My boyfriend got the sirloin steak. We also got a side of Brussel sprouts and fingerling potatoes. Way too much food for us! Every thing was ok. Not mind blowing  but good.  200 dollar good?? I'm not so sure. I don't know maybe if I could focus on my date and not those old men it might have been better for me. I will give the B and B burger joint a try!	1
The best bar/restaurant in the neighborhood! The vibe is perfect on weeknights; weekends are bit busy. BUT the drinks are AMAZING and the food is, too! A new chef just took over, so I&#39;m hoping my favorite food, the market artichoke, isnt discontinued. But I will come several nights a week regardless! The servers, bartenders, bussers, etc are all really friendly and down to earth. Honestly this place is the perfect middle ground between scene-y and divey. If you hate both extremes, go to Churchill.	1
Three days before NYE and our friend's 30th birthday, Churchill changed their agreement with us and left our party of 30 people with no plans. Their management is unreliable, unprofessional, and this place doesn't deserve any business. It's too bad they didn't try to accommodate us.	0
I really like this place and my wife doesn't. Mediterranean Pizza. Good prices. Light on the toppings though. Which may be good for some. Fresh ingredients, lots of selection and brick oven baked.  They get a little lower mark from me because it is a bit small and atmosphere could be a lot nicer if they were larger. They are sort of part casual dining part fast food diner. 3 of 5 stars for a casual dining experience.	0
I have to give them the benefit of the doubt. With so many good reviews that rave about them.<br><br>Everybody can have a bad night right? Was that the case last night?<br><br>Whatever the case, they should be ashamed to serve such dishes and call themselves italian. I take exception. Have they had a nightmare in the kitchen? If so, why don&#39;t you just say so to your customers, and with a glass of wine on the house, problem solved. Being honest and straightforward should be the way, yet not a word.<br><br>So as we wait for an hour or so for our starter (salad), I look around and nobody is getting served, people looking around and towards the kitchen in the hope that food starts coming out.<br><br>We ordered fettucine ragu and gnocchi in tomato sauce. When they arrive they are both drowned in tomato sauce out of a can, both the same, tastless. What is that all about. I read the reviews and people rave about their gnocchi. <br><br>So I aks myself: <br>1) Has everyone gone mad?<br>2) Have I gone mad and can not recognize greatness?<br>3) This shite is not the ususal fare they serve.<br><br>So, with the benefit of the doubt, I&#39;d go back. But, hey I had to pay for last night and no words of apologies from anyone, so I probably won&#39;t<br><br>Yelp. power to the people.	0
Even though we made a reservation we still had to wait a while before we could get sat. It ok though because Ive heard alot of good things about this place so I couldnt wait to try it out finally. When we finally sat at our table the first thing I thought was that there is no privacy. We were a table for 2 and we were about a foot away from the table beside us and could even listen in to their whole conversation. Whatever, theyre a small restaurant and just trying to get as many people sat in the small space they have. The waiter good at making sure we were happy and even recommended some things to us such as the filet mignon (I was ordering the steak and fries when he brought this up) and was not disappointed with it. After the meal they brought over the platter of desserts and although I wanted to get them all, I settled with the pot de creme and the chocolate tart. Pot de creme was great but the tart tasted like I was eating straight ganache. I love sweets but couldnt even finish it since it was so rich. Not a typical cookie cutter restaurant which is what i love about this place.	1
This is truly an excellent local native restaurant. Food is really good. No better yuca anywhere. The sandwiches are loaded with meat. Portions are large and prices are what you want in a local restaurant. Don&#39;t expect a fancy restaurant. It&#39;s not. It&#39;s more like a local cafeteria. Bright, noisy and just plain comfortable and fun.<br><br>That being said, when you are finished with your meal, for dessert, go next store to the bakery. The desserts are yummy and the cafe con-leche is the best. Try the almond horns and the pastelitos. Great restaurant!	1
I wanted to like this place because it&#39;s in my neighborhood and I love tacos. I had the maple fried chicken and the pork al pastor tacos. Both tacos were filled with chunks of fat. Who puts a chunk of pork that is all fat into a taco for a customer and thinks that&#39;s acceptable? I had to spit it into my napkin. Even the chicken had chunks of fat. I get leaner meat at the local taco stand. Also, when our water was empty, the waiter kept taking our glasses away instead of asking if we wanted more water. I had to ask for a new glass twice. I was really disappointed in this place.	0
Great dive bar with really good food. Burger and fries are outstanding (some of the best in Madison). Beer selection is good.	0
I&#39;ll keep this short and sweet..<br><br>There is no such thing as good sushi at a japanese buffet. Some of the cooked items are decent, but the sushi is HORRIBLE.	0
This place was horrible!! 9$ bland burritos, no flavor at all. The salsa, its not that special either. Everything there tastes like it was out of a package, nothing seems fresh at all. Gaucamole & chips is 8$!! If you ever have the chance to go there, just take 20$ out of your pocket and burn it and that should be about the same experience I had.	0
I and the group of 6 who I was with ate at the Diamond Tavern due to our time constraints between conferences. The first night the food was good but the service was very poor. The second night, the service was very good, and food was average.	0
Tried this place for lunch because my friend wanted to be healthy...I'm not a fan of health food, but do like some vegetarian dishes... But No butter, No Milk, No Sugars, No Msg ?!?!?! I thought how good can this be?!?! Well I AM damn happy we tried this place!! This place is excellent!! Had the Chicken Veggie pizza = Amazing!!, and my friend loved the Chicken Risotto!! Definitely going back...probably until I've tried everything on the menu!! Oh and they have a Waffle and ice cream dessert..DEFINITELY on the menu next time!!	1
This place is over-rated. I came here at least four times to just make sure the high rave about this place stays true to their words, but I was disappointed all four times. <br><br>I came here around 11pm after work since I was hungry and it was conveniently close to work and the subway station. The buffet was closed so I opt for the warm premade packages that have been sitting in a plastic container for the whole day.<br><br>The tuna Kimbap and spicy kimbap both tasted awful<br>Bulgogi was really dry<br>Japchae was DRY TOO and had a weird taste. I had to throw it out.<br>Garlic Chicken tasted like chinese take out.<br><br>Overall cheap, but poor quality. I like their choice of drinks in the back, but other than that i&#39;m not going back. Not worth my $6	0
I hate to say, the food here is just really not that great - bordering on awful. I had the fried chicken, my friend the brisket sandwich. Neither has much flavor, and at $10+ each, with a 20+ minute wait each... Let&#39;s just say I won&#39;t be back. The chicken has no flavor. It didn&#39;t come out hot, the fry was not crispy at all, and the meat, even the dark meat, was more dry than overdone breast meat, so much so that my jaw started to hurt. It had no flavor. Truly an accomplishment if I think about it. The slaw needed salt and had over powering dill. And pickles? I was expecting your standard crisp pickle. It was okra. Gross. Not a fan of the slimy texture. The brisket, also tasteless. I imagine the positive reviewers are just taken by the decor, but really don&#39;t know good food.	0
I&#39;m upping my report to a 5 star. Everytime I come here people are the best! Customers chat with you, help you find stuff. The owners chat and help you out. I never leave without free stuff extra. <br><br>Get this, they have fresh almonds in their pods straight off the tree. It was the best almond I&#39;ve ever had, like a science lesson too. They have a new pictorial menu with more options. Their hummus is perfect, spinach pies are the best in town and veggie friendly, their grape leaves are moist and fresh. Y&#39;all need to check it out and start patronizing pronto!!!	1
Very pricy, very small dish, food does not taste anything special. Do not worth the money at all.	0
great food but if you are going to order to go i suggest you call ahead. the wait here can get long	1
Oh my yes. My bestie has been going here since they opened, she&#39;s friendly with the owner. She&#39;s been trying to get me to come to the mainland to check it out, and I&#39;m SO glad I finally did.<br><br>First of all, the decor. So cute, it&#39;s beyond words. Like walking into someone&#39;s really adorable home. I love their creativity with the wallpaper, I love the mismatched chairs, I love the bathroom. Everything sweet &amp; clean.<br><br>Now the food. Local. Organic. Vegan friendly. DELICIOUS. I started with the yuca fries. Granted, I&#39;m obsessed with yuca fries. But these were the best yuca fries I&#39;ve ever had. The miso soup was phenomenal: heartiest, most substantial, most flavorful miso soup I&#39;ve ever had (bestie&#39;s 2-year-old had a cream of yuca soup (vegan broth based! yes!) that I was happy to help her eat, also amazing). The macrobiotic platter was delicious, and the guava sorbet, WOW.<br><br>Super vegan friendly &amp; super tasty, I will definitely be hitting this place again. YUM.<br><br>P.S. For those of you who are not vegan, my bestie says to try the flan.	1
This place is ridiculous! First, let me explain that the food is no big deal at all. Know you are paying for the view. If you want to just go outside and have a drink, and someone orders an appetizer, they charge you a 10 dollar sharing fee (even if and when you order a drink). I will never come back here again! <br>When the server or the greeter finds out you are not interested in ordering anything to eat, they come by and take your utensils (so there is no way of attempting to share a dish no one can finish alone anyway).	0
I swear I eat from this place once a week. Always extremely quick delivery and easy pick up for when I&#39;m walking my dog. They also pack their to go boxes very thoughtfully.<br>My classic order is the spring rolls (off the Vietnamese menu) and the pho with beef eye round. Everything tastes very authentic and fresh. Also great for their Chinese lunch specials! Bubble tea&#39;s not bad either. <br>I really don&#39;t have one negative thing to say about this place. They&#39;ve been a great addition to my side of Brickell, and have managed to save me from many a hangover. I love 3 chefs!	1
THIS PLACE IS AMAZING. Yesterday I returned for my 3rd visit. The food is amazing! The quantity is fantastic! Prices are cheap! When I go, I order the Chicken Katsu and a side order of Vegetable Egg Roles. This totals about $12.00. The Chicken Katsu comes with rice, macaroni salad, miso soup and salad (which is to die for!). <br><br>They offer your typical restaurant drinks: Coke, etc. along with Hawaiian Sun drinks. BIG plus!	1
I was really impressed by this place. <br>The food had very good presentation and it tasted very delicious. <br>This will definitely be my new hang out spot.<br>The owner and chef were.very nice and attentive. <br>This is the kind of place you really want to support.	1
Gross!!!! This is some of the worst pizza I&#39;ve ever had. There is no flavor. It feels like rubber. And I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s not even real cheese.	0
We booked Blossom based upon the Open Table rating.  We like Asian Food, but don't generally book Asian restaurants on vacation.  Blossom changed our minds.We enjoyed a couple cocktails at the bar before dinner, they were excellent.  The bartender was fun and attentive.The meal was an experience.  The appetizers were great (get the green beans) and the main courses were unique and delivious.	1
Came by this place because my brother recommended.<br>Small space and about 12~18 people can fit in here. Not a lot of wait because it was late at night.<br>First of all, the foods are over priced. If i have to pay almost 40 dollars including tip for a small portion of fish and a small pot of dwen-jang pot and a meat combo, I&#39;m not gonna be happy and probably go somewhere else. The meat quality wasn&#39;t really fresh too. Most of the meat were tendons and little pieces that&#39;s about to turn into powder.. <br>Below average service even when it wasn&#39;t that busy.<br>I wouldn&#39;t go back unless my brother force me to. There are lot of other good Korean restaurants in/out of LA.	0
Great sushi, great wait staff, but the way they take/don't take reservation is a big issue. 45 minutes wait on busy nights so the need is there but they don't call back, or accept reservations for less than 6 people. And then they only take 2 reservations per night for the entire restaurant. Curious to say the least.	0
Best dining experience in LA. Period.<br><br>Somehow snagged seats on my first attempt... now currently salivating at the thought of going back, whenever that may be :)	1
Everybody must get stoned and go to Fred's.Cool crowd.HUGE menu.Open 24 hours.Cheap.Things I recommend:silver dollar pancakesdime bagwaffleshippie sandwichmacaronni and cheesechocolate shakesred velvet cakechocolate cakepenne pastafish n chipsmushroom taquitosok, point made.Just check it out, you'll have fun.	1
It's a cute place. I wouldn't mind going there for drinks but I don't think I'd eat there again. There was a pretty long wait. The service was bad (in terms of time and courtesy). The food was just OK (but pretty bad value considering the really small portions and high prices).Wouldn't recommend it to be honest.	0
Surprisingly not many reviews for this great little BBQ joint. I stopped in for lunch, but my thought was that the TVs and blues music would make for an ideal spot to watch a game with friends. Great BBQ. 2 sauce types, regular and spicy, both good, both on the sweeter side of the taste spectrum. Considering the lack of many BBQ joints in Madison, this should be on the radar for BBQ fans.	0
Baristas are always nice and I really appreciate them. Coffee's just fine. But y'all need to get a handle on your baked goods! Well, maybe just the bagels ... if you don't use them all up in a day, DON'T keep them! Give a charitable donation (all baked goods in fact!), send them home with employees, sell them for super cheap at night, anything but sell them to us the next day. I could literally hear my jaw crack/pop when I was trying to eat one. Ughhhhhhhhhhhh I spent money on that? Come on.	0
I was contacted by someone from Perch assuring me that my charge will be refunded. Great. Justice. I can move on with my life, right? WRONG. <br><br>Just got another call tonight from a manager at Perch about this mistake. I checked my credit card statement and saw that I still haven&#39;t received a refund!! How many people does it take to fix a mistake that THEY made in the first place?	0
my roommate &amp; i came here today for lunch. she told me they were known for their thai barbecue but i really like duck so i decided to give that a go. i ordered the S-10, which is the crispy duck dinner with shrimp fried rice &amp; steamed broccoli. <br><br>the duck wasn&#39;t really that great. parts of it were really good, but other parts were dry and difficult to chew. it also seemed like they gave me the back, so there were lots of bones &amp; extra crispy parts. <br><br>HOWEVER, their shrimp fried rice is amazing &amp; the portion is fair. admittedly there aren&#39;t many shrimp in it (i think i had 2), but it tastes so good i didn&#39;t really mind. i also really liked the broccoli (and i&#39;m not a big vegetable fan). <br><br>all in all, i&#39;ll probably come back again &amp; try the bbq chicken.	1
This is a great option on the Las Vegas Strip.  The entrance (on Harmon below the pedestrian overpass between Planet Hollywood and the Harley Davidson Cafe) is a bit hard to find, but worth the search.  Nothing fancy, just a great place to take the family for a casual meal.	1
Essential points: great draft beer list, great beer events, great food, good atmosphere (maps!), and good service. I've never had wine or cocktails here but I've heard the servers give good recommendations. This place is a must-go.	0
Service was outstanding as usual - the meat carvers came to our table frequently even when we all of us had the red side up and we did have multiple wait staff working with us to make sure we had what we needed.  Always a fantastic time when we do go here.	0
With meats cooked in-house and incredibly fresh ingredients, Chopping Block has the makings of a majorly successful sandwich shoppe. I&#39;m so excited that this place is becoming a part of the restaurant boom happening in the Financial District.<br><br>I came here on a weekday afternoon with my co-workers and although the wait for our food was long, it was way worth it. I had the grilled chicken, feta, fry sandwich and it was on point! Granted &#39;health&#39; went out the window when the fries were added to the bread, this sandwich was unique and delicious. Meals come with popcorn and a nut brownie. Popcorn leaves a lot to be desired, I think they&#39;d be better with fries...or even chips. Brownie was a tasty surprise! Everyone else I ordered with was satisfied with their meal and found it to be one of the better sandwiches they&#39;ve eaten in the Financial District. <br><br>Overall, I&#39;ll return--but cons include high price tag and slow turn-out. I hope they can work out their kinks and shave the prices by a small margin while keeping the same fantastic quality of their foods.	1
Best view of DTLA ! I loved the drinks and appetizers on their happy hour menu. The staff was nice and friendly. I will definitely coming back for dinner.	1
Achtung! Achtung!<br>There&#39;s a new German deli in town.<br>The place is clean, small and simple in a small strip mall. We met some friends there on Monday at 6:30, we had some other friends that couldn&#39;t make it til 7. Little did we know, they close at 7, the staff was so nice, they never said anything, kept a smile on their face and kept serving us. I felt so bad after I had found out we kept them there late.<br>I had the Rahm Shnitzel, the portion was huge. It was cooked perfectly, not greasy. The gravy was yummy. The spaetzle was a bit crispy which I&#39;m not use to but it was good. Doug go the West German burger with fries, he was happy with his meal. We saved room for some Apple Strudel, it was really good, the vanilla sauce on the side was killer, I could&#39;ve eaten it like soup.<br>I&#39;d be interested in trying their breakfasts or some of their fresh deli meat selections. They need to get a liquor license, a good German beer with some Brats would be great.<br>Donka Shane and Good luck Cafe Berlin.	1
I used to frequent Toast a few years ago and most always left happy. I hadn&#39;t been there for a year but recently went for brunch with some friends. They made some changes to the food and presentation, and the quality of the food has significantly gone downhill. The omelette came out not very warm, the Oscar was bland, and everything that we ordered was just not as good as I remembered. Very disappointing.	0
Nice decorations and a all around nice restaurant. Other then that the service is lousy, the food is mediocre. Your 16 year old son can make a better meal at home. Very few of the staff members speak english and the bartenders have a limited knowledge of their own profession. Good looking staff and restaurant. That is all you are paying for here. I was outraged on the lack of service.	0
Food is good, service is OK, but the kitchen is slow. It&#39;s a good lunch option but expect at least 1.5 hours.	1
Best food, best menu, wonderful management. Great to people<br>With kids, shaded indoor and outdoor options. They really care about each customer. My kids say this is their favorite lunch spot!	1
Theyre always good for a late night breakfat sandwhich. PLUS 24 Hr delivery!... love it.	1
Best late night spot<br><br>No thrills, just good ol&#39; American diner with huge portions you can share. <br><br>The French Toast is amazing, one of the best. Its good old fashion french toast get a side of bacon and eggs and your good to go.<br><br>CASH ONLY, you can usually find this place with the huge line of people outside of the building	1
So cute! I really really like how open and bright this place is. When you walk in, there is a take-out type counter with communal tables. You can get coffee and also order food there if you plan to eat at the communal table. The restaurant and outdoor patio portion is separate and will require a reservation if you come during prime time. The menu is cute. Limited, but everything sounds pretty good. I really wanted to try the french toast, but since I just went to the gym and needed protein, I got the baked egg skillet instead. It's pretty small, but I loved how they mixed the vegetable with the eggs. Obviously very fresh produce used. There is a small mixed greens salad on top that is lightly salted. Delicious. It's not cheap for what you get, but you get good quality.I also forgot initially to mention the biscuit bites. Orgasmic. Don't miss out on this. It's heaven in your mouth. Dip it in the caramel sauce and butter they give you.	1
Loved this place!! The sushi was sooo good and the prices were great as well. The heat roll was amazing as was the cheesecake tempura. Will def. be back !	1
I had the most wonderful experience today in toast. The waiter was very nice and gave me his honest recommendation instead of acting like everything was equally great in the menu.<br><br>I got a mocha, and stuffed french toast. It was such a great meal. Very flavorful, and delicious. Served with fresh fruit and the coffee, that also came with two amazing mini cookies.<br><br>I left with a smile on my face an a happy full belly. Totally recommend going, specially after lunch hours when there was no waiting involved.	1
Our new favorite place.<br><br>Went in with my boyfriend last weekend. The two guys there were a)awesome and b)up-front about the wait we could expect (they bake the casseroles fresh, even if you want an individual size). The food? UNGH. So. Good.<br><br>We will be back. A lot. Sorry, waistline. You never stood a chance.	1
I&#39;ve been here a few times with some of my friends from school. The name SideDoor comes literally from how they built a sidedoor entrance to Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib to create a more casual restaurant.<br><br>As a Gastropub, the servers here really stress that it&#39;s a restaurant for mixing food and drink, and they don&#39;t hesitate to offer drink pairing with the dishes that you order. They are also a fan of sharing dishes family-style, but I find that some of the dishes - the sandwiches in particular - can&#39;t really be shared. I haven&#39;t yet tried the Meat Boards, which seem to be the main selling point of the restaurant; essentially, these are full meat cuts that come out in slices on a platter to share. I&#39;ll have to come back in the future to try these!<br><br>They also do brunch, but I haven&#39;t been able to try the brunch menu yet.<br><br>What I have tried:<br><br>1) Prime Rib Sandwich - My favorite dish so far<br>2) House Smoked Pastrami - I&#39;m not usually a fan of Pastrami, but wow, this sandwich was incredible!<br>3) Fish and Chips <br>4) Eggplant Panini<br>5) Rabbit Pasta<br>6) Mac and Cheese - my waiter told me that after I tried this mac and cheese, I would be dissatisfied with any other mac and cheese in the future. Unfortunately for me, he was correct. It was delicious!<br><br>They also have a giant list of beers on tap, and have a number of house - cocktails. I&#39;ve had a few of the beers that my waiters have recommended, and have been happily satisfied with what I&#39;ve tried.	1
Just came back from this place. Food was so so, drinks were not that special. Bar tender has some sort of preference as who he likes to serve first. I was standing around for over 10 minutes for a drink, comes over to ask and then leaves when someone (I guess he knows) raised their hand. What in the word?!?! Anyhow, that&#39;s my 2 cents. Go at your own risk and try if for yourself if you want but I would not recommend it.	0
Great sandwiches !<br>Only quibble, the menu barely ever changes. But it&#39;s good ! So keep up the good work !	1
Obsessed with this place! I was always a fan of Cobras and Matadors, but this place is just as amazing! The chips n Guac are to die for.. Along with the beef &amp; pickle, Chicken, and Shrimp Tacos! To Top off, I always get a fresh coconut. <br><br>The Price point is great for how tasty everything is and the ambiance is very welcoming! Definitely will be coming here every weekend!	1
Fun, fresh and fast! I good place for foodies on a budget.	1
OMG I got food poison, I went this last Thursday and order a salad, everything looks fine when I realized that the lettuce and other greens look saggy and old, I let the manager know I think his name is Ray or something like that, he took my plate and left without making any effort to help, he just make a stupid joke, I was in bed for 3 days and almost went to the hospital for the pain. Please check your food prior and be careful, you never know if this place can make you sick	0
I eat a plant based diet (vegan) and grabbed a "vegan" soyrizo burrito from here last night, as take-out. The burrito was so-so, and then I bit down on something chewy. There was a big hunk of red meat in the middle of it.Very frustrating and this shows that Papalote, at least this particular location, is not careful with keeping their grills clean and sanitized for those of us who avoid meat (albeit for allergies, or health, or moral, or environment, or other reasons).So yeah. If you are vegan or vegetarian: AVOID.	0
Soooooo glad I finally went! Had the steak burger w/ no sauce, fries &amp; apple pie. They were all fantastic! CASH ONLY but there is a Wells Fargo right next door. NO HIGHCHAIRS if you have a lil one. A little pricy but definitely worth every penny! A historical L A landmark that you must try!	1
SUAVE!ambiance: reminds me of the top floor in marquee, las vegas. hotel lobby-esque vibes meet creepy mansion living room fireplace? ...i dig it!eats:baked brie.. a little to pungent, needed more complimentary snacks to help ease the flavorduck confit.. amazing! a little overcooked and the portion was a bit dry.steak frites.. GOOD GOD! the steak was cooked to perfection, but the real star was the..little sticks of deep fried crack rocks with bits of cocaine sprinkled all over the top! the truffle oil? like the tears of an angel drizzled all over adding intense flavors making these fries INCREDIBLE.probably the b-e-s-t fries i've ever had in my e-n-t-i-r-e life!!oh yeah, ordered a cabernet which i don't remember because all i can think about.. is those FRIES!treat yourself, don't cheat yourself.FRIES FRIES FRIES	1
expensive, slow unappreciative service when empty (8AM on a saturday)...won't be back...food was mediocore.	0

I do not want to write a review.  I would like to write an optional note to the restaurant.	1
I love their honey chicken wings nom nom.... I honestly think it is a bit too overpriced but I go there quite often because I live one block away from it... not that much comolain about this place... good food but expensive...	1
Great brunch/breakfast. Good coffee, casual setting.	0
We went as a group in this new place, just to try. We didn&#39;t have a reservation but we were able to find a spot around 6pm. We were told we have to leave around 8pm.<br><br>Two hours after, after spending $800, we asked for a last bottle of wine. They answered that if it was only for a bottle of wine (and not eating - we already ate a lot to be honest) we have to go because they need the tables.<br><br>It might seems normal, but you have to know there were available seats for like 10 min before we were asked to leave.<br><br>We just expected them to be a little ore concerned about us, even more because it&#39;s a nice place - food is more than decent, the place is beautiful... And a glass of wine won&#39;t have make us stay longer than 15 min.<br><br>And just to clarify, I lost access to my yelp account and this is really not my first review.	0
Fainting Goat is really good. The owners are very very friendly and the serving size is a lot bigger than what I was used to in the East Coast. The prices are very reasonable. This is a good deal. The hazelnut is amazing	1
Disappointed! Pot roast dry, mac&amp;cheese is out of a Kraft box, clam chowder tasteless. Service awful, server not rude, she took our order, brought our food, gave us our chk, &amp; nothing more! &amp; even though we sat near a main aisle, where she passed ever few mins, she never asked how things were &amp; how we were doing, she didn&#39;t even refill our drinks. There&#39;s a flip menu on the table, saying u get a free dessert if a dessert tray isn&#39;t brought to u, I have never turned down a free offer, this time I did, I couldn&#39;t wait to leave. First &amp; last visit ever.	0
Comfortable, easy to have fun with a group, and delicious!	1
I&#39;m going to go against the near awesome reviews of this place and boldly ask, what&#39;s the big deal here? Came on a Monday with my fiance - I was in time for the brunch menu (I think $10.95 for an appetizer and entree), which he ordered, but I chose to order off the regular menu instead. He had the spinach salad with poached pears, walnuts &amp; gorgonzola cheese for his appetizer and the Grilled chicken, arugula, shaved parmesan cheese &amp; lemon aioli Panini for his entree. The salad was decent but the chicken was super dry and not enjoyable. I had an oversalted filet of grilled salmon with sauteed spinach.<br><br>I guess it&#39;s fine for the price but the way people talk about this place makes it seem like there&#39;s real magic that occurs in this joint and the truth is, you get what you pay for.	0
My first time today at stuff em! It was delicious. My two friends and I were in love with the salad bar, there are many choices! I got the mushy burger, it was perfect! Mike was very helpful. Ask for the green sauce on the side! Deff will be back to get stuffed again.	1
Every famous place can&#39;t keep their quality of food, I guess... I wish I can be here when they just grand opened..so I can taste how great they were, and give them a better rate...I&#39;m sorry I need to say their food made me very disappointed, their coffee r weak.. Nth to recommend.<br><br>Plus Not comfortable at all...rush rush and rush...I only stayed here for half hr because ppl here rush and gave us a bad attitude...	0
Drink the Cream Soda - don't eat the food. Seriously.	0
We had Pane Pane for lunch today. There was a selection of different sandwiches available and they were all substantial. The Artichoke and Hummus was wonderful a great balance of crunchy and creamy tangy and refreshing.	1
This is my second review and it comes 6 months after my last which the restaurant lobbied successfully to have removed. Rather than playing that out again I will stick precisely to what happened this time which was a deja vu experience. I was only willing to return after listening to a Edward Goldman review on KCRW.<br>Am seated and order drinks - 25 mins go by and the same manager as from the last visit is summoned to produce a $25 scotch. These guys are total jokers. Servers are like meteorites - they flash by you try and grab them and maybe if you are lucky you can order a hamburger as how long and how badly can this be messed up. Here&#39;s the answer 52 minutes and unbelievably undercooked and really dangerously pink.<br>Patina you may run this plave and it is certainly a gorgeous building but it is a joke how badly this stacks up to your other restaurant and how badly it compares to other restaurants like George in Paris or Sarabeth in New York at the Whitney.<br>No doubt Patina will use its muscle to eliminate this review but it is high time the blinders were removed and they proactively got involved in fixing what could and should be a destination restaurant	0
Not enough breathing space in this place	0
Didn&#39;t eat here, but had great drinks. Very fair prices. Genial staff. Convenient location near trains and bus.	1
Fantastic food! Definitely the tastiest we've had in the area. The atmosphere is a bit cavernous but the service was extremely helpful and I'm already craving the dosa and that ground chicken off skewers.	1
The one spot I got to go to for DineLA! <br><br>I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the service. The guys were great at giving us time to make our meal selections. They could have been better at refilling our glasses but it was nice not to get rushed to order, pay and leave. <br><br>Our order consisted of the Turkey Sliders and the Albacore Tuna Tartar to start off with. Then my friend got the Mushroom pizza and I got the seared Salmon with risoto. The Salmon was amazing! Perfectly grilled and paired with the risotto which was delicious as well. :) <br><br>For dessert we ended up with the S&#39;mores and the Banana Cream Pie. The Banana Cream Pie was phenomenal! We almost ignored the S&#39;mores cause of it. LOL! <br><br>There is street parking - however you need to read the signs and the street is pretty busy. I think the place is really nice, warm wood accents and paneling around the interior with the sunlight coming in through the windows. Great little casual date spot.	1
Friends of mine have been raving about this place for a long time and I finally got to try it. A group of us biked here from Union Station and I was starving.<br><br>Like everyone else has written there isn&#39;t much seating and it&#39;s all around the counter, but we got there right before the dinner rush so it wasn&#39;t too bad.<br><br>Everything is very old-fashioned; the decor, the service, and the food, everything is very simple and of good quality. They still use the same cash register they always had (that thing is an antique!), which means CASH ONLY.<br><br>I ordered the Hickoryburger and a side of fries. The burger was very simple; a burger patty, lettuce, pickles, sauce, and cheddar cheese. It was very good and I especially liked the smoky flavor of the patty. The fries were fresh out of the fryer, still glistening with oil, and were extra crispy.<br><br>A cute little old lady I was sitting next to was telling me that she had grown up in the area and had celebrated her 6th grade graduation at The Apple Pan the year it had first opened. Apparently the food is still just as good and still the same (although they have added a few items to the menu) and so is the old-fashioned decor.<br><br>My friends and I had all gotten our burgers at the same time as the lady next to me and I was shocked to watch this 70 year old lady devour it before any of us had finished ours.<br><br>I could have been satisfied with one burger and fries, but also got a Steakburger. It was good but not as good as the Hickoryburger. It tasted like a pretty standard burger without the smokiness of the Hickoryburger, and the sauce they used had some relish in it which was kind of weird.<br><br>The lady next to me was raving about how great the apple pie was, and when she ordered it she was talking to the server and they gave her the pie for free. She then turned to me with a giddy look of a child and exclaimed, &#34;The apple pie is FREE today! You should get one!&#34; I was skeptical of the pie being free to everyone but shared one with a friend, and it really was free that day! Awesome!<br><br>Since the apple pie was free we decided to try the banana cream pie as well and it was AMAZING! Everything tasted hand-made, from the whipped cream to the crust.<br><br>Needless to say the ride back to Union Station was a miserable one and my stomach hated me, but it was SO worth it!	1
Cool place but CROWDED and we spent the first hour and a half of our night waiting in lines. First to get in and then to get to the roof. Yeah, no pull at this place. That said, I was with a group of TWELVE and we had a fun night once we got upstairs.<br><br>One of the best things about Perch is the staff. No Dbags, everyone was nice from the door guy to the bartenders. That was unusual and made waiting in lines much more tolerable.	1
Really cool place. They recently renovated the space, so it is a lot more organized and clean. The food is really good, a little pricey. They have a great bar and serve a large variety of drinks. Great place for friends and large groups. <br><br>Good choice of Japanese food. Not the greatest quality of authentic Japanese food, but it taste good. <br><br>Great crab cake sliders and they are big. Sushi here is good not great. Nothing here really stands out but every things is good. <br><br>Overall a cool place to have big parties, and for those who want to drink. And since its in the heart of little tokyo, their is so many other options of places to check out.	1
5 Stars because this place makes the best dang red velvet EVER! The first time my friend and I tried it (sitting in the windowsill seat) we went bazzzzurck. Deep, rich color together with a dense moist bundt cake and thick not to sweet cream cheese frosting piped on top and inside the middle of the bundt. I asked the wait what wondrous planet these things came from and he said one of the chefs makes them using his own recipe. I would come to Fred's just for this magical, orgasmic experience and don't forget the decaf coffee to go with it. Boom!	1
Beautiful decor!! But worst customer service!!! Went last night the waitress sit us down, we wait like 10 minutes abd then another waitress ask us who gave you the menu??? We are close you dont see the open sign is off?? I think that was very rude basically she kick us out ... So dissapointed!!! The food looks yummi but i think latin burger needs to hire more respectful staff :(	0
Went to check out Gastropod after reading the write up in Seattle Magazine and though I enjoyed the food, probably won't be heading back. I think my experience would have been different had we been able to eat at the bar, but with the small space and open seating - good luck if you have any more than two people in your party. The food was delicious, but be prepared to share, as the plates come out individually. Also, unless you order a couple of the more substantial options, you may be left hungry. Lastly, they ran out of the most tasty menu items, so at least one party seated after us left because of the limited menu. The beer was great and it was nice that there were some microbrew options other than the Epic Ales. The service, unfortunately, was terrible. Took forever to order drinks after seated and then even longer to order food. We also kept having to order multiple drinks at one time so that we wouldn't be left empty handed.	1
I personally LOVE this place. I wanted to buy one of the waiters' tees (they say things like "emotionally unavailable" and "rehab is for quitters"... totally my type of humor). BOSSA NOVA WAFFLE SUNDAE. This is no joke. The thing is COVERED in ice cream and hot fudge. It's not like the waffle sundaes that you get elsewhere that have like one mini scoop of ice cream on the side. This thing is for real. Also recommend the fried mac and cheese balls. Great place to go at 4 am after a night out.	1
SOOOOO fresh. <br>I got two rolls. A spicy salmon and spicy scallop. The scallop was eh. The salmon was awesome. My brother got the bento box which had so much more food and variety for just two dollars more.. I shoulda ordered the same. The sashimi is SO fresh and tasty. There wasn&#39;t a wait when I went for lunch and the service isn&#39;t bad. I sat by the bar and it was actually pretty comfortable.<br><br>Overall: Average service, average prices, GREAT food.	1
Los Magueyes inspired me to write my first review! My boyfriend and I always use Yelp to find some good authentic food, something different from the every day chillis and cheesecake factory. We came across Los Magueyes and can honestly say it has become a usual for us. Everything we&#39;ve tried has been hands down, awesome! The guacamole is nice and chunky with tons of flavor and the margaritas are not weak!! I honestly haven&#39;t had one complaint. I&#39;m not sure why, but it never seems to be too busy. We even made a promise last time we went to try something new on every visit! Trust, you won&#39;t be disappointed.	1
"Dahling! How wonderful it is to see you! Please have a seat. Let's order some cocktails. Look how they bring us potato chips that are freshly fried in their kitchen. There's just so many beautiful people here. I just adore beautiful people..."And we're off to take in the latest shows at LACMA. Talk about an afternoon well spent. This bar is loaded with tons of specialty cocktails and a pretty extensive dining menu. Sitting here makes you proud to be an Angeleno. Yes, we have fine art, a great place to sit and be seen and we have such wonderful weather. Take that, New Yorkers! Don't ever give me shit about LA being totally devoid of anything interesting or culturally worthy.	1
The fried chicken is overrated. I can do better in my kitchen. It&#39;s also overpriced. The cheese grits were disgusting. There was some Cheez Wiz-like stuff involved. How do you f*** up grits? They&#39;re trying to do too much. The trick to soul food is to keep it simple.	0
Have been here twice now, both times it has taken 15 minutes and focused determination to attract any waiters&#39; attention. After being served the cycle repeats itself all the way to asking for the check so you can find any other place to go for drinks. It&#39;s a shame because the spot is really great, wish management could find good servers.	0
A great spot for a bite and a beer.In a town with many restaurants boasting gourmet or designer burgers, the Black Cats is actually good and not just for show. I'm sure the rest of the menu is great but the cheeseburger was suburb with a cold draft brew to top it off. Atmosphere is cool with friendly service a little slow at times though. And hard to beat the location right at Sunset Junction.	1
We enjoyed a terrific dining experience - the food options and prix fixe/tasting menu options were excellent.  Interesting choices, blending great ingredients and quality mains, without a lot of fluff so it was pretty perfect.  Slightly tight quarters but truly enjoyable.	1
Good food for reasonable price. Will definitely recommend.	1
recommended by my sister, this was the latest stop on my quest to find the best ramen in brooklyn, and it&#39;s definitely up there. i had the aori miso ramen while my hubby had the chang pong ramen. we both really enjoyed our selections, though i would&#39;ve liked to have had a tonkotsu option -- partly because it&#39;s my favorite, and partly because it would give a more accurate comparison to other ramen spots i&#39;ve tried -- it&#39;s hard to say how Samurai Papa ranks against Chuko when i&#39;m having totally different broths. SP&#39;s miso ramen was certainly flavorful, and while the pieces of sliced pork were definitely small as other reviewers have commented, i have to say, the soy sauce egg might just be the best ramen-egg i&#39;ve ever had, that thing was delicious. that being said, the standout of our meal was the pork gyoza, which were light, not too greasy or overly fried, and really yummy -- they might have even been better than the gyoza i had in Japan.<br><br>in the end, i&#39;m a little torn... on the one hand, this is less convenient for me to get to than Chuko. on the other hand, it&#39;s nice to be able to be seated immediately at 8pm on a Saturday and not have to wait an hour for a table. and ultimately, neither Chuko nor Samurai Papa are as good as my favorite ramen joint in Manhattan, which is really what i&#39;m trying to achieve here. so we&#39;ve got two places tied for second but the search for #1 still continues.	1
I tend to go on Sundays because the bar tender at night, David is really accommodating, nice and a lot of fun. The food is great and the atmosphere is cool and mellow. I've met the owners once and they were nice too. The Sunday brunch is awesome. They bring a little thing of lucky charms and fruit loops to your table to munch on as you make your meal choice which I love. Over all a little pricey on a budget but worth it a couple times a month.	1
Seeing all of the amazing reviews made me want to check the place out. Looking at the menu , it was hard to choose because the options are endless. I went with the Miami dolphin dog because i love the dolphins and i love the idea of sweet and salty on any food. I have had pineapple on hot dog before because it is like a Colombian hot dog so this was nothing new yet it was amazing. The prices are great and you will get stuffed for cheap, the only thing was the seasoned fries were under par compared to the hot dog. Will be back to try other dogs and maybe fit a shake in if it would fit.	1
I really can&#39;t seem to understand what the hype is about here. Maybe I got the wrong dish, but I can certainly say that I&#39;ve had MUCH better Thai food elsewhere. Yes, the ambiance is cozy (in a constraint way actually - the space is VERY small) and the place has some cute little quirks to it (a sliding bathroom door and these tiny little glasses that they give you for water) but that&#39;s about it. <br><br>I glanced around and noticed that the majority of people were having what looked like Pad Thai. I had the PAD WOON SEN WITH VEGETABLE which is a glass noodles veggie dish. It was OK. Not much flavor to it. I also tried my mother&#39;s WOK GINGER CURRY WITH CALAMARI and come to think of it, it didn&#39;t taste curry-like at all. It was very salty and the calamari were overcooked. They were too chewy. <br><br>I prefer Song over this place. So much cheaper and so much tastier. But it makes me wonder what all the hype is about when I saw a line of people waiting to be seated on my way out. I do believe in second chances so perhaps I&#39;ll come back and try the Pad Thai I noticed everyone eating.	0
This place wasn&#39;t even really OK for me. I didn&#39;t think dinner here was good at all. The service here was good, the food was mediocre.<br><br>DRINKS:<br>Poolside in Vegas (3 stars): This was different, had lemon sorbet on top which was interesting, a very summer drink.<br><br>Ginger Fresh (4 stars): If you like gingerale, you&#39;ll like this, it was very fresh and tasty.<br><br>Spice it up (2 stars): This was way too spicy, not bad, but need to dial it down a notch.<br><br>The drinks were much better than the food.<br><br>FOOD:<br>Prosciutto &amp; Burrata (1 star): This was horrible, first of all it was the tiniest portion ever. Second, the prosciutto didn&#39;t taste fresh and wasn&#39;t sliced thin, like it was store bought. Same with the burrata cheese, very low quality and wasn&#39;t good at all. I had to force myself to finish it.<br><br>Warm goat cheese fondue (2 stars): Everyone is loving this, there is nothing special about it. It tasted like plain goat cheese, came with apples and bread.<br><br>Roasted Brussel Sprouts &amp; Butternut Squash (2 stars): Way too many and big chunks of butternut squash, the brussel sprouts were actually good and had a nice flavor, but too bad there weren&#39;t many with all the butternut squash which was huge and not cooked evenly.<br><br>Vegan Kale and roasted beet salad: I didn&#39;t try this but my parents shared it and enjoyed it.<br><br>Wild Mushroom Pizza with brie, truffled creme fraiche and arugula (3.5 stars): This was actually a decent pizza, not my favorite, but not a bad item on the menu, it was better than my dish.<br><br>Jerk Marinated Half Chicken (1 star): I did not like the marinade on this at all.<br><br>Red Wine Braised Boneless Short Ribs (3.5 stars): OK these were actually pretty good, wished I ordered it instead of my brother. Still something I wouldn&#39;t crave and come back for though.<br><br>Special Rib-Eye Steak (2 stars): I got the steak special by the Chef, overly marinated with black pepper, they needed to cut down on that. I got it medium and it was, but for some reason it was well done chewy. I&#39;ve def had better tasting and cheaper flat iron steaks even. <br><br>Overall the food here was not good, and I don&#39;t think I would come back. We didn&#39;t even bother with desserts, my mom liked this place, but I did not.	0
Went last weekend and found out it opens 24hrs now. Woohoo~!Cz other usual spot had closed down and I was bummed out.I noticed that their menu had expanded so I tried their new menu, intestine tang. It was spicy enough to enjoy with Kimchi and rice.I finished the whole bowl. I actually crave for one right now. I will definitely come back here again.They have a button to call waitress on every table so getting service ontime is no problem.	1
Hate it being back at this place. I used to love it. Love the soy sauce flavor chicken. They changed the menu. And when I was there, I was WTF and the service was whack. The girl was a b1!2ch. Bad service. Bad combo. Don't ever eat at the restaurant. Jus take it to go or delivery.	0
who knew? those who are iffy about clams can be converted here	1

We'd been very anxious to go back to Shanghai Dumpling King (I recall it used to be called Shanghai Dumpling House). During our last visit, we had some of the best Xiao Long Bao we'd ever had in the U.S....they were quite small, exquisitely thin-skinned, and filled with a copious amount of deliciously scalding broth. Alas, those dumplings are but a distant memory. The latest iteration consisted of much bigger dumplings with little to no broth. They remained thin-skinned, but there was little flavor. Very disappointing, even when compared to Joe's Shanghai in NYC (of which I am not a fan). The best I have had recently would be the ones at Grand Shanghai in Edison, NJ, and even Shanghai Park in Princeton. We also had the pan-fried pork buns which were greasy, bland, and just OK, and wonderful green-onion pancakes which were properly greasy and crispy. I think we will look for another XLB joint for our next visit.	0
Coming from the amazing minds of TDA I was expecting a masterpiece of Mohawk Bend. Unfortunately if was a masterpiece of disappointment. The vegan menu is very limited. My fiance and I ordered the grilled artichokes to start (They were hard and undercooked) and each got a soup. Our meals came out before everything else and then a few minutes later our soups and appetizers followed. Over all my fiance and I were very disappointed. The food lacks the proper seasoning and when we left we were both still very hungry. A $50 experience we will never repeat. Definitely do not recommend this place if you are gluten intolerant either. <br>OH!! And they don&#39;t have iced tea!! Who the eff doesn&#39;t have iced tea?!?!	0
1.50 for elote in a bowl!<br><br>Same guy for so many years. He is so nice and he is very generous with all the toppings. <br><br>He&#39;s here late at night around 8ish-9 and stays past 12 sometimes. <br><br>Lines get long, but worth it.	1
Down the road from my house and offered outdoor seating? I&#39;m in! Went for half off bottle of wine Tuesdays and enjoyed two bottles with some friends. Server was very nice but laid back and busy--didn&#39;t bother me, I was happy with my service. Got the Brussel sprouts and bruschetta for appetizers and the turkey chili and burger for mains....all of them were lick your plate good. We stayed several hours enjoying the fire and chatting comfortably. I will definitely go back. Yes, it&#39;s small and only has one bathroom but you go there because it has great food and a good chill outdoor vibe.	1
OK. Well, holy cow... there&#39;s already 280+ reviews for Canter&#39;s on here.<br><br>It was my first time ever. I ordered the mishmosh and it was brought to the table by a waiter with the awesomest beehive I&#39;ve ever seen. He kept my friends well-hydrated with several rounds of Diet Cokes.<br><br>So yeah, the mishmosh. I&#39;ve never had a matzo or a matzo ball soup or schmaltz. Who knew it wasn&#39;t a gigantic cracker swimming in soup?! The ball--about the size of a baby&#39;s head--was more satisfying that a regular meat ball. The fattiness of the chicken essence with the matzo was magical. Magical! I could have fallen asleep right in the booth after finishing off my soup.<br><br>Other things at the table I wish I could have tried (but couldn&#39;t because it was a Friday during Lent), were the thick ass sandwiches, knackwurst, and over sized salads. Considering how they never close and maintain a pretty friendly staff, the prices were right in line with what I imagined. It&#39;s a pretty good value, if you ask me. <br><br>Next time I come around (which will probably be soon because the Regency Fairfax around the corner has a great Midnight Movie schedule), I&#39;m planning to plant myself in front of the bakery section and try every single cookie and danish in stock! Fat-tastic!	1
Been here several times. This place is close to my sister&#39;s work and the Saban (was Wilshire) Theater.<br><br>FOOD:<br>Pretty good. The pizza was good. I love the cheese... It reminded me of Chicago (the NON Deep Dish). So Good.<br>The pasta was alright... I got the Ahi Tuna salad and the Tuna was good... Very healthy... but honestly... LOVED the pizza. <br><br>DRINKS:<br>Sangria in a Bowl? HECK YEAH! They even have cute mermaid place holders on your cups to distinguished which cup was yours! And yes I did take those home with me. <br>But drink the sangria fast because ice melts and it waters it A LOT.<br><br>SERVICE:<br>Standard. It wasn&#39;t a busy night when we went and so he was good. <br><br>AMBIANCE:<br>Low Key Hollywood feel. It was dark and very Hollywood. It wasn&#39;t the shady kind but yeah, not bad. It&#39;d be good for a date cuz it&#39;s dark and kinda has a laid back romantic feel to it.<br><br>Overall: Not bad. I&#39;ll go back.	1
Before I begin, let me preface by saying that the above rating is only in regard to the visual aesthetic of the room, as I have yet to do a full inventory of the menu. As a denizen of the former establishment at this address, I thought it only fair to walk in at the end of the first business day to check out the new digs. Clearly, a strong vision was employed in the construction of the kitchen area, as it is the star of the room. The bar itself is flanked by the wall which faces Webster St. The taps do not actually reveal what beers are being featured, you have to look at the menu for that. Speaking of which, please be prepared before you pick up the food menu as you will immediately realize that you are no longer in Kansas (as Dorothy would say). Owner Dan Fox is an oink-o-file in the extreme, and the variations on the theme of this menu lays it out in spades. My next installment will cover some of those entries, but for now, lets just say that the beer selection was a little like one of those young broadway starlets trying to draw attention to herself, only to realize that the real action was not on her block. I can also say with impunity that the Central Waters' Hop Rise tastes as close to rancid ursine semen as I would ever think to imagine. I hope to give more details on the food in the next review, which will hopefully yield better results.	1
Beignets that will bring you to tears. A French toast that left me painfully full but completely joyful for the rest of the day.	0
Fast and quick. The kale salad with chicken was very average and not very big. The boar&#39;s head turkey sandwich however was amazing and something I definitely recommend. Make sure you get it toasted!	1
We had a great time and the food was delicious. We had a great service thoughtout the whole night. Thank you for great time.	1
It seems like selecting a restaurant in Capitol Hill is always such a task. Although we are surrounded by a plethora of choices in this neighborhood at some point they all start to mesh together. We decided to go to Nue last night, well, mostly because our friend decided we should. There were four of us and when we got to the restaurant the seating arrangement was anxiety inducing for my boyfriend. Our choices were squeezing into one of the long communal tables (people he doesn't know) or sitting at the bar (difficulty conducting a four person conversation). We chose the latter and I'm happy to report he found the conversation a non-issue. Not knowing much about the place and having a quick glance at the menu, I asked my favorite question, what's the story behind this restaurant? The kind bartender explained, Chris, who is the owner of Nue has traveled around the globe and is super passionate about food. His vision was to specialize in small plates, sort of like the street food he experienced during his travels abroad. I was content with that explanation and on we went browsing the menu.	1
The food is mediocre everything was burnt and tasteless I tried everything the pork belly the ribs potatoes etc I came in excited waited in line for 1.5 hours what a huge disappointment my fellow yelpers let me down :( on the plus side their beer is good<br>P.s totally not worth the price either $80 for little bit of meat	0
I swear I&#39;ve been coming here since I was 5 years old !!!! Best corn in town !!!! This man is loyal to his business and keeps everyone coming back ! The only downfall is that he gets here really late sometimes ! But definitely a great night time snack !! There is always a long line but it&#39;s worth the wait ! Nothing fancy about his corn but it&#39;s always fresh and always ripe ! There&#39;s a reason why everyone in Lincoln heights always keeps coming back for more ! We love him !	1
I went with my roommate to a preview dinner at The District. Located in a chic part of town, The District offers a luxurious and delectable twist to their menu which has Vietnamese food and some of your usual go tos. <br><br>I started off with their version of a margarita which had all of your natural, organic ingredients along with a spice (which I can&#39;t remember) that gave it an oriental twist. Very delicious, and how I love my cocktails- authentic and the perfect mix of liquor, sweetness and acidity,<br><br>For the food- it&#39;s best to order several dishes for the table as the dishes aren&#39;t too big and it behooves you to try as much as you can anyway. THE NOODLES are a must. I eat noodles and pasta once in a blue moon, but this experience almost made me permanently change my diet. We tried the noodles that were a side dish- had some butter and fresh garlic- and it was delightful. It&#39;s a shame I didn&#39;t try the noodles that were an entree. When I go back I will be sure to do so.<br><br>Good luck to The District! I am sure you will be booming with customers in no time!	1
My favorite breakfast place ever! I loved when i lived a hop, skip and a jump away from this place. It has such a good and broad selection of food. Everything is so fresh and the staff is awesome!	1
I&#39;m starting to give up on finding an Indian restaurant in Miami FL that is any good.	0
great chef loved our food we had a memorable night thanks	1
Had the pastrami on rye &amp; pickles. Pastrami was tender but really fatty. Rye bread was good, but crust was as tough &amp; chewy as a shoe. For a leaner and more tender pastrami, go to Art&#39;s (Studio City) or Katella Deli (Los Alamitos).<br><br>Pickles were excellent. I had 5 of them.	0
This review is based solely on the fresh juice and friendly service I always get at the Honey Tree. I like to stop by after gym class &amp; get the carrot, celery, beet, and apple juice with extra ginger for a little spice... Mmmmm so good that I finish it before I leave, every single time. <br><br>Although I haven&#39;t purchased anything else besides the juice and raw cinnamon rolls (not what I expected, but good), the shop is filled with natural and organic food, supplements, and healthcare.	1
I live in the neighboring apartment complex and dropped by since this place opened a week or so ago. This space now occupies where Arunee Thai used to be and has been completely renovated from head to toe. The space, now, features an interesting full black and white, almost Alice in Wonderland theme complete with a rams head clock and b&amp;w tiled flooring, tables, and chairs.<br><br>Lunch specials are completely worth the price at $7.50 for chicken, pork, tofu or $8.50 for shrimp and beef. Specials come standard with a choice of appetizer and entree. The lunch portions are generous with many different options to choose from. <br><br>We had the Pad See Ew with Beef fried spring rolls. Pad See Ew was not overly oily and had a subtle bell-pepper flavor. I had the curry pineapple fried rice - very fragrant and well-seasoned fried rice. Can&#39;t really go wrong here. Curry puff appetizer was more or less a curry empanada served over a small salad. Thai Iced Tea was not cloying but served in a huge mug - delicious! <br><br>Service is very homey and nice; We were greeted, seated, and waited upon with such genuine care and compassion. They checked up on us without being overbearing and made sure our water was filled constantly.<br><br>Currently, closes at 11PM but they are waiting for their liquor license to arrive in a few weeks before pushing back the hours. I saw that they had 6 different types of beers on tap behind their bar so the alcoholic in me is excited! More to come as this place gets busier and busier - welcome to the neighborhood!	1
A hunt for a salad bar in the neighborhood led me to Local. They told us to have a seat, and someone would be with us. They brought us water, and we waited. And waited. And waited.<br><br>There was ONE other table in the place, and 15 minutes was all we were willing to wait for someone to come take our &#34;order&#34; so we could go serve ourselves.<br><br>We got the hell out of there, and made the long drive to Souplantation, like we should have done in the first damned place.	0
Great happy hour! Loved their pizza and the mojito were delicious. Great place to meet friends and enjoy a conversation.	1
Great view of the city (obviously). Filet Mignon was good but not Mastro calibre. Not even BOA come to think of it. More like Outback Steakhouse but with less people from Okhlahoma. Desert was good. Slow service made us miss tip-off vs Miami. She paid for it with mean thoughts (but we still tip because its not cool not to). Also every one of my reviews says its bad for kids because I like my food without kids.	1
Are you serious?!<br>This restaurant is so ugly. There is absolutely no ambiance.<br>The food is average. The prices are high. <br>I just don&#39;t get it....def a mistake was made coming here.	0
Came for happy hr place looks nice..good ambience for the time of day (5pm ish). The happy hour menu looked interesting if a little pricey and you have to order a drink which didn't look like happy hour prices. I ordered the beef bo la lot and shrimp fresh roll. The roll was ok. Didn't come with hoisin or sriracha which I'm kind of used to. And by the last couple of bites the veggies were getting a bit gross to chew. Other than that they did seem very fresh and carefully prepared. The Bo la lot beef was kind of like Mediterranean style grape leaf wraps with beef in them. They oozed some sort of greasy liquid so I couldn't really stand to eat more than one. I pushed the plate back mostly uneaten yet no one seemed to notice or ask how it was so I just paid and left. For the two cheapest (tiny) happy hour foods and one beer and tip my total came to $18 which I think is up there for happy hours. I'd give it one more try because some of the other menu items look like they'd be really interesting to try as maybe the non happy hour meals are different.	0
Went here for Sunday brunch. Great food, coffee and the service was top notch. Perfect little spot that I will definitely come back to.	1
Went to this fun place with friends.<br><br>A belly dancer shows up like every 15 minutes, it&#39;s... kinda distracting for guys... I must admit that I wan&#39;t able to focus on food. *ahem*<br><br>Well, items we had are...<br><br>- Calamari steak<br>- Braised Swiss chard<br>- Almond filo/dough sticks<br>- Mint tea almond panna cotta<br><br>The food was good, if I recall correctly. Now, question is where I should put my money on her...	1
I like this location the best b/c it's the closest to me. It's pretty spacious and the waits aren't too long.Been here a few times now and I'm addicted to the Hatch burger, medium.I had to race myself here last weekend after a bad burger at Eureka!Burger in Claremont...Yes I ask myself why the hell I drove all the way there for a mediocre burger. uh! My answer...for a friend...(If he sees this...muy meeyan...but dude, my tbuds were not liking it)So yea, this is the place that did a spiel thing- trying to make me feel bad for wanting to add freakin lettuce to my hatch burger. SOU!Guess what? It was amazing-er!Anyhoo...the food runners here are pretty dumb (which is usually the whole staff)They kept thinking my burger was a Socal Burger just b/c of the lettuce...Obviously no thinking job here....doi doiI get my hatch with a light beer (usually Pranqster).Which is a great compliment to my burger.BTW, I hate the fancy splash of sauce on my plate.It makes my buns wet and gets all over my hands.So unnecessary and annoying.I've been very annoyed these days.Good thing I'm just rating the food.	1
Not terribly welcoming for vegetarians (there&#39;s one eggplant and one grilled cheese?) but other than that, the fillings are fresh and yummy, the seasoning delicious. These sandwiches hit your like a sledgehammer. A sledgehammer of yumminess. Portions are reasonable and filling! And there&#39;s seating outside, which I&#39;m always a fan of.	1
Love the 24 hr store hour and the online order feature. Pretty convenient. My delivery came 20 mins before the "promised" time so when I was hungry that definitely made me a happy customer. I love fries and boy their seasoned fries are the best fries I've ever had...	1
Horrible food! <br>Super fake italian version, the Tuna carpaccio is that thin that is impossible to eat and the arugula is FULL of garlic! Really<br>The gondola truffle pasta is undercooked (cruda) which is disgusting for ravioli or any filler pasta. And all butter	0
I dine here annually with important clients.  Good escape from the traffic of other Mandalay dining options.  And normally excellent quality. This year,we had an overcooked filet and red wine served so cold that we had them bring out hot water to warm up each bottle to get the wine to a proper drinkable temp!  I'll treat this year's experience as an anomaly and will be back next year.  But for the cost, you ought not have to endure these fundamental restauranting flaws.	1
I got the Ooey Gooey fries and the Kung Pau noodle bowl and while the fries were pretty good, the noodle was just WAY TOO SALTY. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s just me but I just couldn&#39;t finish eating it... and the place is just way too expensive. Should have tried the pork belly bowl instead since that&#39;s what most reviewers like.	0
Have another croqueta....with style.<br><br>This location offers the small restaurant dining experience with the same croqueta action. Located in Stefano plaza on 137th Avenue near Bird Road, this location caters to the &#34;north of Coral Way&#34; crowd. <br><br>The atmosphere is a little more grill/bistro with a splash of cuban bakery thrown in. You have a well rounded menu of favorites and some ritzy items like risotto and lamb shank to bring you a bit of fancy into your dining. Dinner service is often subdued, but Breakfast is always a packed house.<br><br>If you plan on coming here for breakfast here are a few tips....<br><br>Desayuno Criollo... it has everything including croquetas and cafe con leche y tostadas. A favorite of mine for a long time. I find it will satisfy even the hungriest amongst us.<br><br>Come early.... On the weekends the place fills up fast. If you arrive and see a line out the door, you may want to let someone off to hold your place while you look for parking.<br><br>Croquetas to go..... just because.<br><br>....and as always, if paying with a card, please leave your gratuity in cash.	1
Went here 2 mornings in a row. King Beach is open early and the early morning cyclists seem to have found this place!<br><br>Playa is absolutely screaming for good food, and the community has welcomed Playa Provisions with open arms. Seems like they are still ironing out some service wrinkles. Coffee took a long time and arrived after my meal. The prepared salads were supposed to be ready at 11 but came out half an hour late.<br><br>As far as breakfast goes, I recommend the coffee and baked goods. The hot food and sandwiches - not so much. I got the lentils which were just stewed lentils with an egg and a slice of bread for $9. Meh. The next morning I got the breakfast sandwich - the bread was too big for the sandwich and it was greasy.<br><br>BUT the baked goods are phenomenal. The gougere is to die for. Cinnamon roll yes. Pretzel croissant yes. You gotta be ready for a carb breakfast and coffee - protein isn&#39;t really the theme here.<br><br>Parking costs money but if you beat the attendants to the lot at breakfastime you&#39;re in the clear.	1
am i the only hater for traif? i really like the setting with the little piglet logo but i was kind of astonished by their high requirements. Luckily we had a party of 7 or else it was mandatory for each of us to have the $40 per person chef special. A friend of mine brought a drink from starbucks and they told her that she was not allowed in with that drink. the waitress told her its because they didnt want to a large company like that to ruin their ambiance. i understand if they didnt want her to drink it while she was attending this great dining event but this was no outside beverage at all. she just bought it before she came so she didnt want to leave it outside and she had to gulp it all down before she sat. I had to tell a friend not to come eat because it was mandatory to have the $40 per person course if there were 8 people or more. we ordered chicken wings, hamburger sliders, spare ribs, tuna eggplant kecap, softshell crab, italian pasta, and fingerlings. spare ribs were a little too sugary and so was the chicken wings. the sliders were good but not for the price. the softshell crab was great too but not for the price. i loved their serving style, it was very family oriented because it came slowly. a small portion of everything but that was also the downfall, the portions were way too small for the price. i expected a lot more from a trendy up and coming area. i believe the bill was about 240. none of the 7 people that went that night went home full after the dining experience. the tip was a mandatory 19.5%, more than a lot of manhattan areas i have ate at.	0
Great food and prices! Just wish the portions were bigger or there was something more included like a side of bread and hummus... there was a nice variety though so we&#39;d like to come back and try other plates :)	1
I have never been a big fan of their food. It's just been blah. Any random Vietnamese place makes better bahn mi and noodles. Previously, I did say I enjoyed their customer service. Tonight was not the case. We ordered one sandwich and one bun bowl. It took 45 minutes, while three people who ordered behind us got their food before us. Customer service was crap. No apologies or explanations were offered. They just looked around nervously without even addressing the issue or offering an apology. It was appallingly bad customer service. Oh, and a line cook wearing nothing but a sports bra is pretty unappealing. Their sweat can easily fall into your food. To top it off,our food was cold, soggy, and pretty disappointing. Never coming back.	0
This restaurant is a solid bet. Good food, good service. Wine list a bit limited. This is our default restaurant in the area.	1
No. This is not a food truck. This is a restaurant and a great one at that. I keep seeing comparisons to taco trucks where you buy your taco, eat outside and hope you don't spill anything on your clothes. I was skeptical but I have to admit from the very friendly staff to the different selection of tacos this is definitely a place where I will be coming back. I hear the rumors about the micheladas. Looks like I'll have to go back for some more detailed "research."	1
The Moselle is incredible! i mean the best i ever ate wow!! truly amazing Moselle....<br>i just tried the Moselle and i guess that the other portions are also legendary....<br>but the reason i giving Beehive 4 star rating because they close in Monday!! why?!<br>I wanted so much after a hard day work to relax with a piece of Moselle but unfortunately they were closed! too bad i think they could gain more costumers and popularity also if they will open in Monday	1
So amazing! Awesome lunch special with free edemame appetizer and fruit dessert! It's my new fav spot!	1
Ambience is good. That's about it. Service is below average. Food is subpar. Very small portion. Salad looks so tired and tastes tired. Meat is too rough to be chewable. Even fried calamari is unchewable. Disappointing experience.	0
We had a big dinner planned for 7 guys to celebrate my friends bachelor. To start the evening our table wasn't ready for the 8:30 reservation we made. We were finally seated at 9:45. By that time the suckling pig (the specific entree I came to this restaurant for had run out), but I didn't learn this until after We had ordered it. Because of this one of us changed his order to lamb and then learned 40 mins later that that wasn't available either, so then ordered lobster. To make things worse, the lobster came out 20 mins before everyone's steaks so he had almost finished his meal by the time we were served. I feel this shouldn't happen at a restaurant of this caliber. While they were not bad tasting the size of the steaks was also barely enough to feed the group despite us being very clear about how hungry we were when we asked how much to order. We were comped a small dessert plate because of the wait. We were all unimpressed with this $1200 meal. It didn't live up to its price or 5 star standards by any means. It was not the start to the evening we hoped for for my buddy's bachelor.	0
Did I get a &#34;Bad Batch&#34; or what? Got the Tocino bowl w/Garlic Rice &amp; 2 Eggs. 3 Tacos; Bisteak, Sisig &amp; Adobo. Unfortunately, the &#34;Shredded&#34; Tocino, Bisteak &amp; Sisig were just way too salty! If these are &#34;Franchise&#34; recipes, then it&#39;s too bad. If not, please taste the food before sending it out &amp; balance the flavors. Especially if people are going to pay $17+ for 2 small dishes. Friend &amp; I couldn&#39;t even finish the food and the serving was not big. High sodium dishes... True Filipino Cuisine! Lol	0
I am not sure how authentic Colombia food can be but this is definitely NOT a good place to enjoy. Food was awful. I had Colombian Fritanga, o..my ...god, it was so hard to swallow them. They over fire them and very very dry. My friend&#39;s pork chops were way too hard and bland. I also ordered Virgin Frozen Coladas and it had too much whipped cream in it. Overall, i am not very happy about it. I don&#39;t think i will ever want to return.	0
I ordered a Canter's Reuben with corned beef. It was gigantic, delicious, and beefy. I spread thousand island dressing all over it, making it even more scrumptious. The potato salad was sweet and just right. I wanted to get something from the bakery but didn't get a chance to. I will next time, though. A little bit pricey, but you get what you paid for. I highly highly recommend this place for good eats :D	1
GREAT STEAKS!!! Excellent Seafood!!! Awesome service!!!	0
Bluephies had me at Vodkatorium. Seriously, I was visiting from Dallas and happened to pick up one of those tourist mags in the hotel lobby to combat boredom. When I saw the ad I couldn't help channel Liz Lemon and exclaim  I want to go to there!. I Yelped it first, however, and was a little concerned over the wide array of ratings, but figured I would take my chances. I'm glad I did.	1
I loved it. Good pizza whose name I couldn't pronounce. N something. Hmm. Great coffee too (I was a grad student).	1
Okay. So I really wanted to love the food from this place because<br>of all of the wonderful, raving reviews, but just didn&#39;t. Waited in line <br>for approximately an hour before being seated at the bar, but really<br>wasn&#39;t bothered by the wait because the majority of reviews said that the<br>food was worth it. Ordered a half dozen of oysters on the half shell,<br>and thought they were just mediocre- yes, they were very meaty, but I missed<br>the saltiness/brine of traditional east coast oysters. Ordered the combo pan<br>roast with shrimp, crab, and lobster, and it was just mediocre too. <br>While I found the food to be just, meh, the staff was lovely and<br>worked very hard to please their customers. Would I come back<br>to this oyster bar again on a return visit to vegas, no,<br>but I&#39;m glad I tried it because I would have always wondered if I<br>was missing out otherwise. Now I know that I will not be missing out.<br>Save your time and money for something else.	0
We&#39;ve been quite a few times on weekends for breakfast and have been happy with the food, service and price. Recently, however, we visited and I noticed that the tables were mostly full of empty plates, cups and glasses. Lots of gazes and little conversation. After 18 Mins a waiting to see if we might be waited on, we left. No one noticed. The staff was busy preparing a take-out order and completely forgot about the dining room guests. I think some others walked out without paying after trying to with no luck.<br>The good news is that there must be jobs available here. At least in management...<br>We ended up at the El Rinconcito Latino on Bird Road, where we were eating within about 10 mins of our arrival.	0
Ordered a naked (bunless) sliced brisket. A bit dry (needed to be smoked more) and 6 very small (3 inch long or less) thinly sliced pieces weighing less than 1/4 pound total in a carryout clam shell (With a 2 oz portion cup of BBQ sauce on the side) for $7 (plus tax). That's around $30 a pound!	0
A great  overall expierence . The staff, food and atmosphere were outstanding! Highly recommand.	1
The food is pretty good!The service is trash.The stars are sitting comfortably at 2.5.Yelp doesn't allow half stars.The question is: round up or round down?Snooty waitress, slow service, crumb-scattered table, unprofessional everything.I was late for work, because my hour lunch break was up before I finished my food. And there's no way I'm losing my job for Korean chicken wings.So now the question becomes: why not round down?So I round down.	0
Disappointed... And overpriced..Charge extra if u ask for dressing. Or tacos with rice and beans.....	0
Great fish tacos, excellent margaritas, and yummy taquitos! The guacamole was great! Overall, we were very impressed!!!!!!	1
Came here with the family just three days after it opened and everything was perfect! We ordered a ton of appetizers to share, the meatballs were a favorite. The bread they put on the table was delicious. We ordered the gorgonzola mashed potatoes = amazing, the eggplant, chicken parmesan, pasta dishes and more. Everyone was very happy with the service and their meals. Can&#39;t wait to go back, thankfully it&#39;s only three blocks from my condo!	1
Worst customer service ever.. I liked the Monta on Henderson side better ... It&#39;s a small fried rice that we were waiting on for my daughter. we were nearly done eating our ramen and my daughter&#39;s small fried rice still hasn&#39;t come.. The server gave the fried rice to the wrong table.. I found out because the table next to us later then said I never ordered this fried rice... Pathetic! Just lame.. No sorry instead she blamed it on the Chef! Lol wow	0
I have spent MANY a late night here. Not necessarily after going out, but just as a place to hang out and eat good dinner food. Like others have said, the Mac Daddy and Cheese Balls, Bosa Nova Waffle, and Juicy Lucy are solid picks and are amazing. Every other time I go, I get one of these three. The other times, I get this combination: The sauteed spinach (with garlic), cottage cheese, an English muffin, and cup of coffee. Sounds odd, but it's awesome that it's even on the menu.There are a few people that say the service is slow and the food could be cheaper..... why are people in a rush at 3am at night? And what's another dollar for good atmosphere and a welcoming staff? These are people and you're not a king, you don't need instant service. Slow down and enjoy life, you only live once. Anyway, if I had to pick one dinner that I would go to for the rest of my life, this would be it. I have been going here for years and I have built a bond with it that goes deeper than food, it's a place to hang out with friends and waste hours catching up.	1
We've been here before and liked it.  It was the place my wife chose for Valentine's and we were looking forward to it.  The noise level, as could be expected on a crowded night, prohibited normal conversation as everyone around us was shouting.  The food:  my wife's filet mignon was superb, perfectly done.  My choice, the special, a bone in filet mignon, was uneven.  I ordered it medium rare, and the portion closest the bone was almost there.  The outer portion was closer to well done and somewhat pasty.  The sides, however, redeemed it.  We had the lobster mac and cheese and the asparagus.  Wonderful!  As was our server.  We'll likely be back, but not for a while, and NOT on a holiday.	1
I'm embarrassed to admit that in all the years I've lived in LA, Friday evening was my first visit to this dining institution. I'm a fan.We lucked out on parking in a nearby lot and were seated right away when we entered the deli. Score!The waitstaff is friendly, but slow ... which was a-ok because they were speedy with the drinks. There are pickles and sauerkraut to nosh on (to my delight and hubby's disgust) while we waited for our dinner.Hubby enjoyed a French Dip sandwich and I ordered The Marilyn. Both were a-ok. It was a lot of food! What really rocks is the bakery area ... where we went a little nutty and got a ton of stuff to go. The black and white cookies were heavenly, the chocolate rugala was amazing without being too heavy, and the eclair was flaky, fresh, and fantastic. Yes, we pigged out, but it was over the course of a weekend so it's not quite as bad. ;)They still kick it old school with the cash register ... they have a handwritten ledger and an antique register. There are two lines ... one for cash and another for credit. Choose wisely ... they like to keep it orderly.Overall I would definitely be back!	1
I wouldn't have normally chosen to go to dinner here, but a flip of a coin sealed the deal..also, I'm staying at a hotel within walking distance, and the options here are extremely weak. (I wish this trip had me staying in downtown Madison, that place is amazing)	0
I've been here twice for dinner, and both times it was a great experience. I love that it's secluded and if you blink, you'll miss it. The ambiance is fantastic, low lights, nice staff. Great for a b-day dinner with friends, a romantic evening with that special someone. I like that the service was kind of slow. I hate feeling rushed at a restaurant.I can't remember too much about the food because I was drinking. I do remember whatever red wine I had, it was good. I'm definitely going back...	1
On our annual trip to The Orleans, my spouse and I have learned that there is no better restaurant in Las Vegas.  Price, quality, service, and atmosphere is all five star.  On three nights we had filet mignon, lamb chops, scallops, and shrimp which were perfectly prepared and quality cuts.  We could find no fault with the quality of the salads (just order the dressing on the side) or deserts.  Wine values were outstanding and my martini fixed just right.  Service, as always, was impeccable, even when we kept bringing extra people with us.  If something is not good, it only takes a mention and they will make it right.  We hope to be coming back many more years.	1
The food is great we did a rib eye & a sirloin pretty basic cuts, both were done correctly. The mushroom ravioli appetizer is special, the tuna as well...The decor is nice and makes this place a nice one for 'special' dinners. As others have mentioned it is pricey with a good tip for good service we were at $185 for two appetizers, two sides, two steaks and one glass of wine... hummm....	0
First off- Congrats Chef Piero. My co-worker and I shared two sandwiches the cuban and american(the american version of an italian) both delicious.	1
Very friendly indeed. The Pope Francis sandwich is yummy, the Simply Cucumber is mediocre. We also had the Monkey Biz briosh and it was a fun dessert.	1
I've been before and had a wonderful experience, but I won't be back on a Saturday. The place was jammed. First, we had a hard time identifying who our main waiter was, so our request to split the check (two ways) wasn't honored. The sides came on tiny plates and the sides (potatoes) at the market bar were empty on 4 occasions we tried. We waited a long time to be offered the filet mignon when other meats came by 6 times. We tried to order wines and shots and they never came. We weren't charged so not too big of a deal. The gauchos and service staff were lovely and we did enjoy ourselves. I just wouldn't try again on a Saturday night.	0
This place has skyrocketed to my top-five list of Downtown Miami restaurants! The layout of the place and decor are superb, with a modern trendy look that&#39;s also intimate and romantic. VERO&#39;s friendly and welcoming staff members will make you feel at home from the moment you step in. The menu offers a variety of excellent traditional Italian dishes at great prices ($10 lunch menu available), and good portions -- you definitely get what you pay for. The amatriciana sauce with pork belly is a dish you must try! In short, the excellent service and ambiance will turn any common pasta and pizza into a delightful experience with each bite. Welcome to the neighborhood, VERO!	1
I've never had worse service in my entire life. Never offered a refill for starters. But we didn't even see our waitress after she took our initial dinner orders. I mean we saw her just at the tables next to us chatting it up with them getting them refills on drinks pretty much acting as if we were not even there! The food itself was okay I don't particularly get the fawning over this place to be honest. It took them nearly 20 minutes to get our bill to us at which point I reached the boiling point. At no time did the waitress come back to give us the bill a sign of the fact she was either ignoring us on purpose or expecting a lousy tip from us. Normally I am extremely generous with tipping but for the first time in my life I gave Zero. I hate this place. It truly made me feel as if I was worthless garbage. I can only hope the restaurant has karma happen to it. Like patrons ignoring it and being forced to close. Yeah I said it I hope the place closes down	0
So I went here on Monday night for dinner with my better half. Unfortunately dinner was a bargain (thnx to DealPop) but, "more than I bargained for". $3 beers almost alone deserve 2 stars. And their menu is alright. However, I'm %95 sure that they gave me food poisoning, or some other ridiculous 24 hr. stomach virus. The place was sparse, even for a monday. My sweetie and I came down with almost the exact same symptoms 20 hrs after we both ate here. I'll spare the gory details of nights to follow. However, I'm not sure I can comfortably eat here again. Enter at your own risk.	0
the BEST sandwich I have ever had, the halloumi! Absolutely delicious and I rarely eat vegetarian. This is a must try!	1
You guys are insane. This pizza is horrible. I came here with my group after hearing all the hype on yelp only to pay for over priced and over salted mall pizza. The service also left a bad taste in my mouth. Keep this pizza a secret.	0
The food is amazing!!! Make sure to try the al pastor and enjoy a Mexican coke! This is worth the gas to drive across town for me and the service is amazing!!! I will be back definitely!	1
Fantastic location. The Far Bar is behind this narrow little brick alley and entirely outdoors with simple white lights strung across in the air. <br><br>Awesome Happy Hour prices for everything from well drinks, to Asian Beers, to $3 for a huge plate of Wasabi fries and numerous other food items I can&#39;t remember. $6 Bacon Old Fashions. <br><br>Really friendly servers! Oh, and Happy Hour on Monday is 3-Close!!!! Other nights happy hour ends at 7pm. The only thing that prevented them from being 5 stars is the servers were a wee bit slow, but AWESOME!	1
Cooked from great local produce. Simple, clean and delicious.	1
I&#39;ve always experienced excellent customer service before - and the other night was no exception. Friendly, efficient and courteous throughout. <br><br>For starters, we had the oyster and scallop selection. Oysters were good, however a little on the small side. The scallops were prepared well and they went well with the sauce and sides. <br><br>I had the steak special with grilled veggies. Prepared just right and a good sized portion. I didn&#39;t want too much as I wanted to save for dessert (somewhere else). <br><br>My friend opted for the ribs special. Now her meat just slid off the bones. She also asked for mash and I really liked her dish better than mine. <br><br>Both meals were delicious and the staff was awesome. It&#39;s a little on the pricey side however I&#39;d still come back even if I didn&#39;t have a ton of gift cards to use up	1
I was pretty excited to try this place but made the mistake of reading their home page that stated their "dining time" suggestions. 1.5 hours suggested for the 4 course and 2.5 hours for the Chef's tasting menu. As soon as we were seated we felt rushed. I tried to slow things down by ordering a cocktail before opening the menu but the waiter was very insistent. I ordered the 4 course prix fix with wine pairing. I wasn't even finished with my cocktail before the Sommelier poured my first taste of Riesling. She continued to pour for the next course before we finished the course we were on. Rushed. We finished and had 17 minutes to spare....The food was delicious, the wine was delicious however things could have been slowed down just a step or two	0
I visited Jjanga back when it was Kanji for sushi. This time we came for Hibachi on Valentine&#39;s Day. We did not make a reservation so it was a miracle a party of six was able to make it to hibachi within 30 minutes. We had an awesome hibachi chef. He was hilarious and put on an awesome show. Our food was great and there was no shortage! The house sangria is delicious and so is the house made sake sampler. We also did 2 rounds of sake bombs! I personally think it tastes better with plain cold sake but the flavored isn&#39;t too bad either. Benja is awesome and took great care of us!	1
This hip restaurant is located in a posh and industrial enclave of DTLA. Take two steps in the wrong direction and you might find yourself face to face with a belligerent transient (true story). The Biscuit building is filled with impressive lofts that makes you feel like you're in some European metropolis. The Lavender honey goat cheese appetizer is well worth the visit to Church & State. It's creamy texture with floral after tones left a sweet memory in my mind.The roasted marrow bone was very rich. Although, the pickled radish added the necessary acidity to cut through the fat, I wish this dish had more flavor to make it memorable to me. I liked that the mussels came with fries. However, after reading that the fries were frozen, it lost a certain appeal. Some of the mussels had a fishy smell to it which was a bit of a turnoff...and the broth didn't have enough flavor for me. i wouldn't order this again. The caramelized scallops were delicious. I loved the multi-colored cauliflowers. Some were pickled and some roasted. All in all this dish was well prepared and lovely to eat.	1
Oh what a glorious view. I'm a sucker for a high perch overlooking our splendid city. This habitat is very inviting for a beautiful LA crowd. Fashion plates, actress/model types are abound with the handsome gents running closely after them. I came stag and there were plenty of choices peruse. I'm a male-watcher. If I wanted to watch whales, I would be in Monterey Bay or at the local dive bar. This is neither. OK, so I found parking in front at 8:10 PM on a Saturday night. I didn't valet but this place definitely has the glamour points to warrant it- but if the parking gods smile upon me, I don't turn it down and make them frown. Open the double glass doors into a stark ,modern, chic yet tiny entry/lobby of the hotel. Take elevator to 6th floor. Then take another elevator to the roof- voila! You're instantly transported away into the roof walkway entry where there was no one at the maitre'd station. I whizzed over to the bar (I can always sniff one out at any locale) which was tiny but had seats. I ordered the cucumber, mint refreshing vodka cocktail- ordered mine with Goose. Why ruin a perfectly good cocktail with shitty vodka? They said I could smoke there. So I lit up. Then the bartender kindly clarified, "OK, anywhere but at the bar..." Oh, NYC sophistication went out the door. I really miss bars that let you smoke. Oh well, more impetus to survey my surrounds. Oh, what surroundings! The pool glistened under a nascent moon- big, clear and lemon yellow filtered from our perpetual smog. The city gleamed with vivid colors reflecting from our shiny modern architecture, the skyline was just perfect. The weather was just so right on- not too cold but with a cool breeze to remind you that we live in a desert where it does cool off significantly compared to the sweltering days. I sighed with heavy breath as I fondly gazed upon this plain Jane of a town, which under these drastic makeover environs, looked like a billion bucks of glittering gems piled and strewn across a thick, ashen, black velvet backdrop. David Yurman doesn't have anything on this dazzling, illuminated gemstone of a city!My girl showed up a few minutes following with exact cue as I had just completed my lap around the roof passing the pool, the sunken deck complete with outdoor cozy furnishings and a giant, ubiquitous glass beaded gas burning fire pit the size of an impressive aquarium. Back up a short set of stairs to the masses around the pool, sipping their cocktails elegantly as they could barely contain the same appreciation I had for this magnificent view. My friend and I sauntered around for a bit as I was more than gleeful to show her just what I had seen a few second ago. We sat at a few high boy seats with a table away from the throngs of nocturnal beauties, it was perfect for the coterie of appetizers that we wanted to order and the miles of conversation we had ahead of us. We had the spicy sweet chicken wings (not our fave), baked potato fries (our clear favorite) and the charcuterie plate. She had a fruity drink which was winning my heart but alas, I had already fallen for the tart, refreshing drink in my hand. It was just the perfect amount of food for 2 girls catching up on decades of memories over a few cigarettes and libations. Staff was attentive and sincerely courteous. I plan to make this home base this season. Oh and they have brunch here- already dreaming of it. Highly recommended. This is what LA is about.	1
2 for $20 is still a great deal. A lot of TVs made it nice to watch the Badgers in the Big 10 championship game. Aubrey P. was a great server. Overall a great meal out!!	0
Sat at table for 15 minutes while the three waiters stayed behind the bar and kept their backs to us and the entire restaurant, occasionally turning around to stare right at us and still not take our order. I waved my arms enthusiastically at the three of them whenever they turned around. The place was not busy at all...they just didn&#39;t care. They didn&#39;t even see us walk out.	0
Mike the manager was very rude to one of his employees. He yelled at her and everyone could hear him	0
Manager directed employees to release hundreds of New Years balloons onto the street for someone else to clean up wherever they land. Regardless of the food or drink, this is a shameful way to run a business.	0
Kalgooksoo here is legit!<br><br>There are several varieties, but it seems the seafood and the chicken knife-cut noodles are the best. You can get the super-sized version, which can feed more than 4 people. If you want to try something other than kalgooksoo, the teji bulgogi isn&#39;t a bad option either. <br><br>Prices are inexpensive and food is great, but service can be lacking at times and banchan is limited.	1
UDPATE: I gave this restaurant another try and the mussels were raunchy and rancid and I found hairs in my french fries!!! Gross!!!<br><br>I so so wanted to give this restaurant a 4 or 5 star rating, however, I simply cannot based on the poor level of service I recieved from the moment I walked in the door to the moment I left.<br><br>We had an 8 p.m. reservation for 3 people and when i had called to make the reservation, I had requested outdoor seating. I was told that the patio outside was on a first come first serve basis only, so we might have to wait a little. No problem. We arrived, and were told our table was getting ready. We wait 20 minutes; it&#39;s going on 8:30. I run over and ask if we can just sit outside to make it quicker and the hostess explains that there is a private party and the patio is reserved all night. I was a confused because I was told something earlier on the phone, but let it go.<br><br>We were finally seated at almost 9 p.m. Our waitress was unattentive. She stopped by once at the beginning of our meal to take our orders. She did not run the food to our table and she didn&#39;t stop by at all to check in for drinks, how our meal was, etc. When she did finally make it around, she did not ask how our meal was, she did not offer us coffee or dessert and she was in such a hurry to get away from the table. She dropped off our check and another 20 minutes passed before we waved someone else down to actually take our check to run it. I think it was the manager, but he was mousy, didn&#39;t ask how our evening was and just took the check and ran off in an instant. <br><br>On a brighter note, the food is well prepared and very delicous. The goat cheese fondue was fantastic and to be honest, this was one of the better burgers I&#39;ve had in Los Angeles in general. Also, the Mojito cocktail was out of this world. My friend had another Luna Park speciality cocktail and it was fantastic as well. If I was rating on food/drink alone, they surely would get a higher rating. <br><br>The atmosphere is something I really enjoy - low lit, loud&#34;ish&#34; music and a happening bar inside the restaurant. I don&#39;t enjoy disturbing other diners with my conversations or vice versa in a quiet restaurant. Luna Park delivers in food and atmosphere...If only they could find a semi-friendly staff to match....	0
I used to love Canter's. I live in San Diego and it is kind of a long drive to get there. Took my nephews out to eat and had the worst service EVER! I tried to call Lynn this morning and was told "she comes in later" and the guy that answered the phone just hung up! Huh? Our waitress was rude, slow and was saying snarky remarks when we were leaving. Seems like the service is definitely something they need to work with. Never saw a manager so no on really helped us when we waited 30 minutes for refills. When we wanted her to put our order in for a sandwich she told us we had to order that upfront. So, I am going to eat my meal and then wait upfront for 15 minutes for a sanddwich. I paid $40 ffor two meals and drinks. If I am going to pay that much I sure as heck don't expect to deal with a waitress that is miserable and rude. It was obvious.My sister wanted to go to another deli but it was closed. Don't know if I would be back. It's sad because some of the servers are really nice. There should be someone walking around to make sure tables are taken care of....	0
I love this place! I have been to Jaks several times and have always been more than satisfied with what I order. 	1
Jesus christ what a $#!T#0!3. Enter at your own risk and be prepared to be trampled by the high horses of ex-frat bros and sorority girls who never grew up, then have your body carried away in a sea of entitlement, along with your wallet if you order any of their overpriced fare.	0
Great BBQ flavor. Their faux chicken is remarkably close to the real thing.	1
Great Beer Selection, Great Wings, Mostly Bad Service, Horrible Management.	0
Has this place gotten better? Just a tad bit. The employees are still very friendly, but the food still lacks flavor. The pita was better this time.	0
AMBIANCE/ENVIRONMENT: nice evening view of downtown LA skylines, similar to Standard.<br>SERVICES: good<br>FOOD: drinks are good/decent<br>RECOMMENDATION: a weeknight spot for a date, weekend spot for group hanging out, classy get together spot.	1
Try their new summer menu, cho gae gook soo, it&#39;s the bomb! Loved their pa kimchi and jji gae the jji gae was awesome! Definitely going back there.	1
Cute little pizza and gelato shop at the axis next to what used to be the hoxton. Im not a big pizza fan but they serve up some good ones. Service is decent and courteous except there is a major language barrier. Unless you speak spanish, it is hard to communicate... You would think English would be mandatory since we are in the United States. Other then that they are nice.<br><br>Meat lover pizza (5/5) crispy yummy crust with yummy decent distribution of toppings.<br><br>Healthy and spicy pizza (4/5) no cheese light veggie pizza. it was good but I like it with more sauce.<br><br>pizzanezza for two (4/5) roommate loved this but I find it a heart attack waiting to happen.<br><br>chicken wings (4/5) pretty good and not overly sauced.<br><br>Calamari (3/5) crispy but bland<br><br>Gelato (4/5) creamy but a little too sweet for me<br><br>overall my pizza place of choice and they do have a good selection of gelato favor made fresh.	1
I saw this place listed on more than one list of the "best burgers in LA". So while I was driving around looking for something to cure a hangover and passed by it I knew I had to stop. I'm glad I did. First off the burger-it's good-it's really good. I don't know if it is in fact one of the best in LA but it's pretty right on-the bun and the onions are amazing. The fries however-are in fact nearly impossible to beat. The service was awesome and I have to mention at this point that they waitresses looked as if they were cast for the role of "hot hollywood waitress/aspiring famous something or the other"-all of them ridiculously hot. I know I know-it's not about hot waitresses it's about the food but damn....good stuff.	1
Stopped by today because they have frozen custard. Los Angeles needed a place with frozen custard and man have we scored! The frozen custard was sooooo good that I felt like a kid in the back seat of a station wagon on a Midwestern summer evening. The sandwiches looked good but I had just had lunch so next time will try one. But I am coming back for the frozen custard anyway.	1
The food, wine pairing, and wait staff made the entire evening pleasurable and extremelya wonderful dining experience.	1
I would compare their food, service, and presentation to that of a concentration camp. <br><br>I went because of the long lines I would see, and it was probably the worst decision I ever made.<br><br>Save your money, time and appetite, and go to Denny&#39;s or IHOP instead.<br><br>Or for the best breakfast in LA try BLD, hands down the best!	0
In the 3 weeks I was in LA I went here twice and came out both times satisfied and full. They served me up a perfect reuben that was good enough for two meals (it was still excellent 4 hours later). The second time I had an excellent mishmosh soup. I love how huuuuge their matzoh balls are! My mom's were never that huge. I wish their prices weren't quite so steep, but hey us Jews gotta paid too. If I ever get to go here again I'm going to buy some of that delicious looking rugelach!	1
Me and my husband are staying the night at the double tree hotel for our last night on our honeymoon before we fly back home tomorrow afternoon. Both of us love sushi and we&#39;re excited to order out and get back to the hotel room with a bottle of wine. We placed a to go order in the, compared to the alluring outside dining area, run down takeout area and made our way back to our hotel room. $37 for four typical rolls (2 cali, 1 spicy tuna, 1 volcano) with a proclaimed sushi chef in the kitchen- we just knew we were getting something good... When we opened our sushi the first thing we noticed was the smell, a mixture of BO and a sub shop worker after a long night. But, they served other things besides sushi, so we plunged forward. My new Husband poped a roll in his mouth, looked at me, and spit It out. I laughed at him, and asked &#34;It can&#39;t be that bad?&#34; But the answer... Was it was not bad. It was terriable. The imitation crab tasted more imitation bad, and the absolute worst I&#39;ve ever ever had. The worst part was that every single item that made up the sushi roll tasted like it was imitation down to the sesame seeds they topped everything off with. My husband ended up throwing up all night. Thank you, NoVo Sushi for the epic ending to my honeymoon. <br><br>There are alot of good reviews on this place, which is why I&#39;m confused. We may just be Sushi Snobs, but this place... the answer is just dont. The Burger King down the road would have been a safer bet.	0
ughhhhhhmmmmm, interesting. friend of a friend suggested this place cuz it is his favorite, and he lived a really long time in tokyo, so he must know right? um, no, not really. we ordered shoyu and spicy garlic tonkatsu...with additional veggie toppings and sides of fried chicken... and it was just super duper disappointing! the broth is kinda bland and not thick like i expect tonkatsu to be.. BLEHhhhhHh. oh then, the fried chicken is very super duper lacking in flavor! so sad, cuz i was really looking forward to it since i ran a lot in the morning to eat it. MEEPS. will not be coming back, especially making the trek from soma..	0
So I&#39;ve been here a few times since I live down the street, and it&#39;s been usually a very delicious experience, but the last time my boyfriend and I were there we saw a rat behind the bar. Told one of the workers, who spent all of 2 seconds looking for it, and then kind of brushed us off. So that&#39;s pretty disgusting and we probably won&#39;t be coming back.	0
Super slow service, mediocre tacos and the worst cole slaw I&#39;ve ever had :/	0
Why are they so poorly run? Always out of the biscuits, can't get orders right, it seems like this is the first job any of them have had? The service is horrible. It is so odd because it is hugely successful as it is packed. I am happy they are here because I am local and we are desperate for something like this here. Just want them to please get their act together so hoping this yelp will wake someone up. Please? I want to love you Precita Cafe! Please whomever owns this place help!!!!!!	0
My boyfriend's favorite type of food is French, he also has an affinity for LA sky lines. When I heard about Perch... I couldn't help but think it was a PERFECT place to take him for his birthday! Let me just say, it was a little far from perfect. I made reservations about a month in advance. Only to get there and have them tell me if I want to sit outside I have to wait an hour. I guess inside it is. So we sit down at a coffee table with two huge chairs on either side of it. More of a longue- drink- bar hour feel to it. Wasn't exactly the "nice dinner" experience I was going for. But it wasn't a big deal, I was going to make the best out of it!Then comes time for food...We order the Lobster Bisque and Baked Brie. Lobster Bisque--not good. At all. I literally think I could probably prepare a better Bisque. Baked Brie on the other hand- DELICIOUS! And I know for a fact I could never emulate that. So as for appetizers, it was definitely and HIT OR MISS. Not really what you expect for the price.As for main course, I ordered the Salmon Caviar and my boyfriend ordered the Braised Short Rib. My salmon was just okay. I would never ever pay 30 dollars for that again. And the Braised Short Rib wasn't anything to rave about either. It was boring, I think I could have ordered it ANYWHERE. We both came into the meal expecting A LOT and left.. feeling disappointed. I honestly would not recommend this place if you are looking for good food. If you want a view of a gorgeous skyline, sure. Just make sure you're willing to wait a while.	0
I&#39;ve been here a couple of times and it is great if you want to get something good and fast. You stand by the bar, so do not expect to spend a lot of time here. They cook right in front of you so it is a pretty cool experience too. The restaurant is owned by the same people that own Basta Pasta.<br><br>We have literally tried almost everything on their menu and everything is so good. The service here is also pretty good.	1
I went there Sunday early evening and had an awesomely delicious meal! I had read all the reviews listed and decided I had to give this place a try. 	1
I normally don&#39;t like giving a 5 star review off the bat but WOW! <br><br>At first I was kinda nervous about the food since it came out within minutes after we ordered. But the food looked fresh, colorful, and tasty so we dug in. My head started nodding in agreement with my gf as we were inhaling the food, without even speaking we both knew that En Hakkore is a new Go-To spot. <br><br>We ordered the Bi-Bim Bap with Korean BBQ Beef and the Paratha Tacos with Spicy Pork. The Bi Bim Bap serves two easily. Squeeze some of their homemade hot sauce in the bowl and mix and mix until everything is coated then dig in! The bowl has so many flavors going on that compliment one another it&#39;s fantastic. The tacos also have a ton of flavor going on with the kimchi, onion, sesame seeds, cilantro, and pickled radish. The &#34;tortilla&#34; is similar to a scallion pancake minus the scallions. Thicker than a tortilla and very tasty. <br><br>Great place for delicious food at a very reasonable price. You order at the cashier then they bring out your food within minutes to a table of your choice. Nice staff and clean place. <br><br>I may move to the area for this place...	1
Dotty's is famous for their burgers in Madison, Wisconsin. A simple recipe burger consisting of a beef patty, crispy bacon, cheddar, and a sesame bun focuses on the trifecta of meat, carbs, and cheese. The burger will definitely satisfy a burger craving (or the college appetite), however it lacks the polish to make it famous too much further than Madison. A softer bun, juicier beef, and a more mouthwatering combination of flavors with some punch from sauce/salt/vinegar could put this simple burger on the national map.	0
A Caracas this is NOTTT. <br><br>Came here for dinner once with five others, and therefore sampled a mixture of drinks, arepas and entrees. I crashed this party late, and therefore do not know the names of the food I tasted... but names are not necessary!<br><br>Cocotero is your typical Chelsea haunt, with colorful walls and dim lighting, almost DARK, at night (though I&#39;ve walked by this restaurant many times before and noticed that it is rather dark and empty inside during the day.)<br><br>The drinks are okay. The drinks were not too strong; the sangria was almost sweet, and the mango/rum thing my friend had - well, what rum? But the food was sadly average. The meat served with the entrees was not worth it; the shredded chicken over rice was bland, and the beef and pork belly in the other entree was extremely tough. The arepas were unremarkable as well; the saucy chicken especially one was overwhelmed with sauce, as if the cook just slathered sauce over some chicken cubes without bothering to cook. <br><br>All in all, mehhhh. Quality of food isn&#39;t worth a return trip.	0
Much needed in belltown!	1
1 star is too much. Just had the most negligent service. Hostess had to serve us. No menu for food was offered, we were COMPLETELY ignored. Shame considering the price of the drinks warrants a modicum of service. Won&#39;t be going back. Good luck, Stark.	0
Not too much going on. I chose it because it was busy. Hot tea is included. For $9.50 I got miso ramen with tasty broth and one piece of pork, 3 thin pieces of bamboo, half a hard-boiled egg that was still a bit cool, green onions, and noodles. Didn't really seem like much for the money. Waitress indifferent and didn't check in with me after delivering food. I wouldn't bother.	0
This place is a bit schizophrenic.I am staying at the hotel for a week so I am here enough to say that they serve a good breakfast with a friendly breakfast staff.	0
I LOOOOVE this place. I would give it 5 stars, but sometimes the service is a little on the slow side, so I&#39;m holding out on my 5th star. The wine selection is great and the sandwiches are yummy!	1
Nice chill bar with great beer and good food! Great for happy hour. It's outdoors, and you walk through a small alley.There isn't a huge sign so not that easy to find. Across the miyako hotel. The parking attendant was very nice to let me park there for cheap since I told him i'd be back before 10. Very cute and intimate. Bring a sweater if you get cold easily. Been here a few times with bigger groups and it's still not too crazy crowded. (and this place is small) Great mix of people, nice music sometimes live. I went 2 months ago on a wednesday, had the HOTS buger and wasabi fries both delicious! Love the spice! Though I think I kept tasting that garlic wasabi the next day too!	1
Why so serious?	0
Great pie. I walked in to the friendliest lady behind the counter. It was the nicest greeting I&#39;ve ever had in my life. I didn&#39;t ask for her name, but you will know who she is when you come in. My pie was great, just right. Wasn&#39;t too sweet, wasn&#39;t sloppy, right moisture, perfect crust. Had a conversation with the owner, and he sorta taught me a little about pies. Great experience. I wish i had a bigger appetite, i would have bought more. I just went there to kill time and eat something sweet to satisfy my pallets. No regrets.	1
We went to Perch last night. It&#39;s definitely more of a social, bar-type place than a real restaurant. We had made a reservation a week in advance and when we arrived we were seated outside, but had to ask to be re-seated twice because the waiters kept walking by and hitting our table ( nearly dropping HOT food on us!) <br>They forgot to give us bread, which wouldn&#39;t have been such an issue had the food not taken an hour to arrive. We ordered the asparagus salad, the steak frites and the Beouf pot au feu. The salad was nothing special. The steak frites came with frites with truffle oil but they were completely soggy and while they tasted fine, they really were a nasty texture. The pot au feu was nice, the horseradish mashed potatoes were STRONG and the peas were super dry, most defiantly frozen. We had the pot au creme and berries with whipped cream for dessert which was lovely. Overall, it was pretty disappointing. It gets very loud and crowded after 8ish so enjoying dinner can be tricky. Overpriced, overrated. Best recommended for drinks..although those weren&#39;t amazing either. Put simply, your paying for the view. <br><br>**the decor is sort of wonky, a little bizarre the restaurant floor looks more like the cafe in Friends than anything French...a bit cheesy<br><br>Try the bar at the Standard for a more refined experience, or the Water Grill for an amazing meal!	0
Long wait outside and another long wait for service of a mediocre meal. The chicken was too salty, the Catfish was lost<br>somewhere inside of the overbearing breading, with a dollop of Tartar sauce on top. Seriously? Mac and cheese was served with a dash of hot sauce on top. Who does that? One of our party ordered Chicken biscuits and deserts to go, only to find that the deserts were not included in the take out order. They don&#39;t remember if they were charged for them or not. As far as I&#39;m concerned, the entire meal should have been comped.	0
Five stars for the truffle burger. It's is so flavorful and juicy and everything a burger described as umami should be!!!~Came in for the happy hour, grabbed a beer and the trio sampler of mini burgers. I LOVE mini things, they are just so damn cute. And what better way to sample a few of the different burgers Umami has to offer? So since the truffle burger is definitely number one on my list, I would say next out of the three is the Hatch burger, and then the manly burger. All three of them were tasty, but that's only if I HAD to put the min any particular order heehee.	1
Service and food was excellent the spice was just right. We had a little of everything chicken, goat and beef . We will most definitely be back!!!!! Rice pudding was awesome!	1
Staff is stuffy to the point of rude! Very unpleasant experience.	0
While I was walking around downtown la looking for food to have for my lunch.. And this guy seen me looking at the menu and said come to our place its very good and all the things that he was naming sound great.. So I had tried chicken burger wit the side of fries.. Once I bite into the burger it was soo amazing I just couldn&#39;t stop eating until when it was all gone.. I like that they had the pics of the food next their was the name of it.. Really good	1
Went here for the 1st time looking for the best chicken soup in Midtown. Sadly to say it wasn&#39;t the best chicken soup but it was good vegetable soup. There was literally a shred of chicken in my soup. Although I was disappointed, I had to admit the broth, rice and veggies were tasty. I figured since I trekked 4 ave&#39;s down, I&#39;d go all out and order a soup, sandwich and dessert. So I ordered the rotisserie sandwich on a whole wheat baguette and added spice. It was sooo good! The bottom of the bread soaks up the juices nicely while staying crusty on top. there was plenty of chicken and potatoes packed in. Its a nice clean flavorful sandwich and is worth the price. Lastly I had the carrot cake. I was a tad bit sad there was no cream cheese frosting but you can see that its a dense moist piece of yummy goodness. It didn&#39;t disappoint! I am writing this review fully content. Overall my order came out to $21.18 which is a bit pricey but the quality of the food at hand is unquestionable. Chicken Provence is a nice little spot. The food was prompt, well packaged and the service was great.	1
i love going here! they serve Eagle Rock Brewery beer (which i love) and are always pretty friendly.we usually sit at the bar to eat and usually get the same thing.we'll start with their bread plate- amazing!! then get the caesar salad- amazing!and then, the best of all- the pepperoni pizza! i go to a lot of pizza joints and this has to be one of the best out there. i've heard their brunch is good too but i just keep going back for the pizza!!see you guys again soon!	1
Great patio, service and chicken sandwich! Very stroller friendly as well - no surprise on Southport but still appreciated.	1
Almost every time I eat at Marigold, I walk away unsatisfied. It's one of those places that some of my friends love, but is simply just not for me.	1
Awesome service, Awesome food...you may call it the bomb, I call it NUCLEAR. .. I will be back...	1
I was really in the mood for some BBQ, but did not know where to go so I did a little Google searching for a place and found People&#39;s Bar-B-Que with a lot of positive reviews. Good reviews and the fact that it was in the hood, I decided to go there because those things must mean that they had authentic BBQ.<br><br>The reviews I read were mostly great, but it definitely couldn&#39;t be because of the service (the girl at the counter couldn&#39;t get my order right and had attitude) or the atmosphere (plain and basic), it had to be because of the food.<br><br>After a bit of a wait, I finally got my food (ribs and chicken, however I ordered only ribs). It was pretty average BBQ, although the sauce would not be described as a typical BBQ sauce. The sauce had a surprisingly nice taste and flavor though. I was just a little annoyed eating the ribs because they were randomly chopped (not by each rib) and the sauce was excessive (I got some on my clothes). The sides were pretty decent.<br><br>Basically it was good but I doubt I would ever go back. The unique sauce made it interesting, but other than it was pretty standard.	0
Some of the worst food I&#39;ve ever eaten. First let me start by saying that the wait time to order our drinks was approx 15 mins. My date had to go find menus and let the waitress know that once again we&#39;re here. The food awful. The greens were salty and tasted like they&#39;re straight from a can, and if they&#39;re not, I have to say that someone has a special skill if they can make a collard green taste that bad. The cornbread dressing was a stiff blob of something with once again gravy that appeared to be from a jar or a can. The cabbage was the saving grace but for the fact that it had very little seasoning. The fried chicken was inconsistent, the wings were a tad greasy but weren&#39;t dried out like the chicken breast. The mac n cheese tastes like it looks, like dried paste. Look at the pictures that are posted they will tell you everything you need to know. There is no love and definitely no soul used in making the food at M&amp;M. Don&#39;t waste your time.	0
About 3 months ago, I had to come out to LA for a work event and due to the insane hours we were working, there was not much time to go around LA and explore the eating choices. One of my coworkers kept telling me about this place and how even though it doesn&#39;t look much, this place has some amazing food choices, specifically the pancakes. So after listening to his recommendation, I went here a total of 3 times during my week long stay in LA, and every time, I felt completely full thanks to their generous portions and completely satisfied, both from good food and great service. Now, 3 months later, I still find myself dreaming of their soft and fluffy pancakes. I can&#39;t wait until my next visit to LA because this will definitely be a spot I hit up, especially since it&#39;s open 24 hours!!!	1
The service, staff, and quality of food is always &quot;outstanding&quot; at Cafe Fleuri!  I have been a loyal diner at Cafe Fleuri for over 10 years!  And, I will continue to dine and introduce this &quot;gem&quot; to friends and associates!	1
Beyond disappointed!!! <br>The sandwiches we ordered tried to be special but only succeeded in having distracting seasonings and mediocre flavor.<br>We ordered the meatball sandwich-- ehhh... Meatball seasoning was not particularly good, the sauce was mediocre at best.<br>We also ordered the Hot Chicken Panini.... The calabrese chile became overpowering to the flavor of chicken and bacon...<br>The drinks were all extremely overpriced cans or bottles... Not even a glass of water available:(<br>I will not be returning.	0
Ridiculously good food. A plethora of yummy food options and an extensive beer selection. Such a fun and tasty take on micheladas and popsicles for dessert. The place has great energy. And they have board games. No one rushes you to leave. AND, most importantly, the staff is really friendly. The last time I went, the kitchen was having an off day (my corn was served cold and it took forever to get my nachos), BUT the hostess and waitress came over to us separately and were so sincerely apologetic, and they offered us a round on the house to compensate us for the inconvenience. I really appreciated their responsiveness and the gesture. Diablo remains one of my favorite LA &#34;go to&#34; restaurants.	1
I was told not to review chain restaurants, but this one needs better ratings.	0
I only ever eat here for Taco Tuesday&#39;s! But their tacos and taco salads are really good and it is a great price too!<br><br>Since my work offices are right around the corner, it is a great cheap lunch to look forward too!<br><br>I believe it is 2 tacos for 99 cents and taco salad is only $2.99 (but don&#39;t quote me, you can definitely get out of there with a meal under $5). . .<br><br>I prefer the taco salad!	1
Gritz Cafe is great. Went there and tried the Fried Catfish...hmmmm ..good. One of the best soul food place around. Highly recommended!!!	1
I read a lot of the reviews before going there and was a bit nervous. After going, I'm not sure if I just went on a good day/time or what. Service was really good, the pretzels were amazing and the quesadilla was really good too. Being a fan of micro-brew beer i found the beer to be pretty good too. Overall it was a good experience and I will be back! One extra bonus is that on Sunday's it's happy hour all day, $3 beers and $6 apps!!!	0
This place is sooo dialed in!<br><br>The space is very unique. Walk up deli coffee ice cream part and the dining, out door patio part. Super cool concept, Only had a coffee which I&#39;m very picky and the dark roast was perfect!! Made on the spot. Menu still limited, But Hudson House has been in my top ten for years so I am sure thre ffod is up to par	1
My family and I are new here and we frequent Puerto Rico and the cuisine is a great reminder of all the memories made on the island. If you are looking for great food and wonderful service give this place a try.	1
Great happy hour, thoughtful dishes and nice decor. Brought the parents here after a successful date night. Love, love, love the Rose Sake.	1
Ugh, I had such high hopes for this place because of all the gushing reviews but I'd have to classify our dining experience as a FAIL! The service staff was cold and robotic, and the only person who asked us about if we were enjoying the food was the busser who cleared our entree plates. Our server couldn't be bothered after he gave his spiel about the restaurant and its decor changes. The food was ok but unmemorable (although I loved my smoked chowder), and the cocktails were good not amazing (my old fashioned was so overwhelmingly citrus it made me nauseous).I'm really tired of restaurants that rely SO heavily on the local buzz and their short reputations that they let their service fall by the wayside. Lame!	0
LOVE the service and the chicken bowl is delicious. The sauces and onion stuff that they have next to the sodas taste amazing with the food. This place has become my new obsession!	1
Amazing food and service, true to the BLT name...strange setting at the Bally's though.	1
After reading all of the latest reviews, we though to chime in about the service and just about the overall decor and vibe of the place. The food my boyfriend and I had (steak and a curry dish) were okay. Not out of this world.<br>Our friends with us had a sucky dish that was &#34;pork belly sludge&#34;. We tasted it to confirm it was gross and overwhelming and not what was described on the menu. <br>I could deal with so-so food, but for the price, they need to get some things seriously together.<br>For one, the Williamsburg transplant hostess was beyond rude. I&#39;ve been living in this neighborhood for 14 years kid, don&#39;t front people when you take the job of a hostess. Go back to working at American Apparel.<br>Also, I&#39;ve never been so annoyed as the waitress and the wierdo hostess coming outta nowhere, trying to take our plates away not one, but 3!!!! times, before we were finished. It just became obnoxious and the owners need to have a pow wow about service, booking, and the decor...which was pathetic. At least darken up the dismall foyer, entry way and get rid of the sad home depot mix of service stands at the end of the hall.<br>The place is half assed.	0
Great atmosphere and ambiance, I really liked that the bar is pretty spacious and they have those great big window/doors right in the of the restaurant by the bar, very airy, love that. <br><br>I had to give them 4 starts because of their limited menu and they are not very vegetarian friendly and do not have many food options. They do have a great wine selection which I can appreciate. If you are looking for a great place to just chill with a friend with a great glass of wine and some starters they are awesome.	1
Four stars? Five stars? Get real. This place was *not* good. NOT good.<br><br>I came here on the advice of reviews and it&#39;s one of the first times that Yelp failed me. I sat in the Garden Room, made reservations, ordered what people recommended. Total fail.<br><br>The service was brusque, the food was seriously terrible. Bland, poorly cooked, just bad. Maybe the Garden Room is better during the summer, but it was just horrible.<br><br>I honestly can&#39;t fathom how anyone gave this place more than 3 stars. Maybe I caught it on an off day (but I doubt it). Sure, it&#39;s cute, and it&#39;s nice to have a cute little restaurant in an &#34;off the beaten track&#34; location, but that cuteness doesn&#39;t make up for how much it actually sucks.<br><br>Sorry guys.	0
Loooove this place! The baristas are great and really know what they're doing and happy to talk about how they make they're great coffee! Can't say enough great things!	1
People, there is simply no such thing as an amazing panini. Americans demand oily sandwiches without too much flavor that might otherwise disrupt a quick, almost athletic ingestion. And that&#39;s why we tolerate such middling, cheesy-stuffed meats, a gooey business between two slices of grill-marked bread that bears no real difference in flavor from the cloth napkins used to wipe away the crumbs.<br><br>Let the airports have their greasy paninis and leave the rest of American cuisine alone!<br><br>There is nothing here that cannot be cooked more healthily and tastefully at home. The tomato bisque had far too much cream; the tuna crostini was served crudely with ingredients that tasted the same as their canned equivalents; and the arugula salad came drenched in rendered bacon fat. In all the dishes we sampled, I could not distinguish the flavors of the specific ingredients listed with each menu item from the heavy oil and milk-fat substrates that the chefs deemed necessary to make our meal palatable.<br><br>The only reason why I can imagine so many people write favorably about this place is that they&#39;re conflating the texture and satiation they feel while eating with the range of flavors they&#39;d expect from a &#34;casual&#34; but &#34;hip&#34; dining experience.<br><br>Il Bambino will make you feel very full, but only an army of Yelp reviewers will make you feel good about it.	0
The best pizza around.	1
5 stars for food. The food is excellent and the menu is diverse. We had causitas, which were interesting and delicious but defy explanation. Try them!! We also had pollo saltado and the chicken sandwich, which both used high quality ingredients and were presented beautifully. Seriously, the presentation at this place rivals the most upscale restaurant in any city. Obviously, there is a true chef in the kitchen who takes real pride in the food being served. It is amazing.	0
I paid $16 for a chicken burrito with a small side of guacamole. Rip off. Burrito was 80% beans and rice. And the chicken was chewy and hard. Definitely would not recommend.	0
A place of peace and quiet.. I had doubts of this place when I checked yelp but I&#39;m glad I came here. The waitress here is very friendly and believed to be family owned. Great customer service, you never have to ask for any refills And they even give alot of specials..<br><br>I really recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a Vietnamese And Korean fusion restaurant..best in ktown in my experience	1
I was in the mood for Chinese food and after calling a 2-3 other restaurants to see if they accepted Discover cards, I found that Canton Star did! I ordered Honey Chicken, Pork Fried Rice, Wonton Soup, Crab Rangoon, and an egg roll. Basically a feast. everything was delicious and the delivered the food to my house within 20 minutes so my hungry tummy wasn&#39;t complaining! i recommend this place highly! You can easily feed 3 people with a dinner combination.	1
Best Philly cheesesteak and whiz fries. Simply delicous. Big fan :) If you have a problem eating by the sidewalk, just take it to go. Tooo good to say pass .	1
Very homey restaurant have to say the food was darn good I had the pork shoulder jam I mean I wouldn&#39;t even think it would be that good but it was excellent my drink on the other side was not so great don&#39;t remember what is was but it was slacking on taste should of just got the coke and rum for desert I had the drunken toast which actually live up to its name it was soak in alcohol and I enjoy the crap out of it it the service was great no complaints there and it was good it was really good I will be back	1
Place was empty and food was mediocre, but worst thing was the online menu has lower prices than in the restaurant. This is very deceptive and its too bad there are no laws around this. In this day in age, it takes 5 minutes to update a website so this is clearly deceptive to get you in the door. $17 to $20 is not a huge deal, but principle of it bugs me. Pasta dishes were okay but I've had better elsewhere.	0
reviews deceived med-- especially those from californians who claimed to have found a good NY pho spot<br><br>the &#34;Meh. I&#39;ve experienced better.&#34; designated by the 2-star score is pretty on point.<br><br>will happily pick another potentially mediocre-to-good-enough vietnamese spot next time	0
I eat here every time I am in Seattle for work - the food has always been wonderful and the staff is pleasant and helpful. Great Indian restaurant!	1
Cool atmosphere! Yummy drinks. Worst toasted cheese sandwich I have ever tasted and unfortunately really poor service?!	0
The food tasted good and was a good value. The service was good as well.	1
This is a great place for lunch! The salmon was exquisite, service was impeccable and the wine selection was world class! Be sure to have the 19th hole chocolate peanut butter dessert. Fabulous!	1
I only gave two stars because I&#39;m certain that the food poisoning causing me to leave work early and miss out on done great money, came from here. I ordered the Caesar salad with Salmon, the toughest piece of salmon that I ever had in my life but best tasting Caesar salad I had ever had. That was the only thing I had eaten yesterday so it really disappointed me because as tasty as it was, I&#39;m afraid to go back. I thought I had found a nice little lunch spot but as I lay here with my tummy still haywire.... I simply just cringe. First impressions, hopefully I&#39;m able to stomach going back one day and give them another chance to make it right. Atmosphere and taste 5 stars	0
I love you church and state.. i really do. But the boy and i went to eat for date night there last saturday and what an unfortunate choice it was. We ordered a healthy round of food, including the escargot. big mistake. i popped one in my mouth and it immediately tasted a little funky and slightly foul. Which leads me to believe that it caused me my gastrointestinal pains the next day. gross. never again. Other than that, the server and the desserts were divine. So thank you and no thank you.	0
I've eaten here a number of times. Food is average but nonetheless typical for a large microbrewery. The beer range and quality is good. The outdoor patio is very pleasant on a warm summer day. 	1
Kariem and Millie are extremely kind, gracious, and passionate hosts at this authentic-as-it-gets Tunisian /Mediterranean eatery. Incredibly fresh hommous, BabaGanoush, home made Tunisian crouton bread, and the star of the show: world-class falafel made fresh and with a traditional recipe. Cosy interiors and warm service on top of the simple, homey cuisine make this place worth the trip over to Williamsburg for if you&#39;re from another part of town, and a regular haunt for anyone living in the neighborhood.	1
Very nice staff. Very blah food. I had the chilli and asked for extra sour cream, which I got. It was OK, but this is probably the spot at 2am and not really at any other time.	0
Oh The Wood, you bum me out. I WANT to like you SO BAD.

Really great sandwiches (actually it's all good). Been going there for over 20 years, and it's still good. Man, I could go for the Fairfax right now!	1
My boyfriend and I were just in L.A. on vacation for our anniversary. Our original plan was to go to Mexi Cali Tacos &amp; Co. but they were closed. And we stumbled upon this hidden gem instead. The service was good. The place is small with limited seating. They offer a nice, delicious salsa bar and have restrooms on the side. Now the best part: the TACOS! my boyfriend had their fish tacos, which they advertise as &#34;LA&#39;s best fish tacos&#34; and we agreed. They were amazing! I had the al pastor tacos and damn, so good. I can&#39;t wait to go back to Hollywood just to stop here again. If you get the chance, definitely check this place out!!	1
small combo is good for three people	1
Primo location in Fairfax village and once home of many a movie star like Jack Benny, Lizabeth Taylor, and Marilyn. Decent layout of booths and tables in two separate rooms but seriously requires a Hollywood facelift. Wish the waitresses smiled more. I pray you don't get stuck with the testy matzo ball with legs- Fran. About the corned beef & pastrami here- it's costly and won't curl your toes. Avoid the stoned homeless bums and cockroaches outside! For a supremely better meal try Izzys and Juniors on the Westside. Go Now! Open 24 hours except on Yom Kippur & Rosh Hashanah. beverly and fairfax, north of the Grove.The Kibbitz Room bar, connected to the diner, features local rock n roll talent during the week and end. Excruciatingly small venue where the audience is practically standing on the stage leaning on the guitarist.	0
This place is really cute. They have a great wine list and a lot of happy hour specials. I had the gluten free crust and it was really good. Now all they need is vegan cheese...and no I am not vegan!!Parking wasn't a problem either, can't wait to go back!!	1
Meh. Came back but sat at the bar this time. Ordered drinks which was poured instantly because well... we were sitting at the bar. Ordered a single appetizer (fries with curry sauce) and found the wait to be quite long despite being in the middle of the afternoon and not busy at all. Service from the kitchen was below average. The only thing they have going for them is guinness on tap. I stand by my original 2 stars.	0
Family Donut makes French Crullers which gives them an A in my book. Sure there's no seating or atmosphere and the place often looks deserted but the donuts are great and fresh and did I mention the crullers?	1
Best short rib and Kimchi fried rice. They have a great selection of banchan too. For under $20 they surely treat you like a king!	1
I&#39;ve been coming to the Pantry for breakfast since I was a youngin! This place is among the fondest memories that I have of LA grouped with Disneyland, Universal Studios, Hollywood, the beaches, the hikes, and good old USC. When I went to undergrad at USC, I became a regular on the weekends... either walking or biking to grab a bite. Throughout all of these years, the food has been consistently delicious despite it being always crowded. Dont worry...that line is always ridiculous but it moves fast. Best part is that it&#39;s cheap and it never closes. Definitely a piece of LA history that is a must. Make it apart of your LA experience.	1
Charming restaurant with a lovely outside space. Flavors were all on point! Tried the sunchockes, lamb belly and slow cooked lamb, all really yummy!! Checkitout	1
Oh yea, Paseo rocks.	1
Well I know what I&#39;ll be craving from now on. The Roost served up some crazy good chicken and sides to my friends and I. They got the spicy chicken sandwich, I got the quarter order of herb seasoned chicken. Both were fresh, bursting with flavor, and a good serving size. The sides were great as well. The biscuit is light and fluffy, the peach cobbler was sweet and crispy, and the Mac and cheese was too notch.<br><br>The prices aren&#39;t bad, and the service is a little slow but still easy. Will for sure be back.	1
Came here for the smores desert after a friend's recommendation... When we got there we were told the smores desert was taken off the menu because it was too hard for the kitchen to make. Really? Too hard for the kitchen to make? Don't give that excuse...thats just lazy.	0
Lemonade was watered down and had a taste that reminded me of store bought lemonade that is past its' prime. Steak sandwich and garlic fries were bland. Immensely disappointed!	0
So here we go, as a Food critic person I notice everything. Venue is great and wonderful, the venue looks very clean and maintained. The worker that greets customers and seats people in is very nice but at the same time stated to us that we were not able to sit on the tables because of reservations Two ladies came in and stated to him that they wouldn't like to seat in the stools but rather have a table and the worker walked them in and have them seated in a table. I felt really bad because I didn't get that option but it's okay I'm fine with seating at a stool. We ordered our food and I really can say the food is good. The only thing I would say is the customer service is not so good. We ordered limes and soy sauce and the lady did not show up with our items at all. I understand that a restaurant can be busy but the customer service part of a restaurant is important because lucky to us this place is busy. I will definitely be writing an article about this restaurant on our next newspaper episode.	0
Great service, atmosphere, and amazing sushi. Also, the fried chicken was phenominal.	1
My favorite brunch place in Madison. It is really really delicious food. Everything I order is always hot, and cooked deliciously. I usually get the scramble or a smoothie but seriously, everything here is so good.	0
portions on the smaller side but interesting and tasty! mellow. i would def go back.	1
Great food, good atmosphere, good beer. Would definitely stop by again. P.S. there&#39;s a back patio!	1
Marjorie relocated to Cap Hill and reopened recently but when I stopped by the place felt like it had been there forever. Like a neighborhood bistro where everyone's a regular and if that's not yet the case then the Owner is sure to stop by and welcome you like family.	1
The lomo saltado with french fries was amazing! Simple does not always mean easy. Sure, it&#39;s a beef stew with tomatoes and onions but there was a depth of flavor that only comes with a long stewing time and experience. The desserts were just as good as the main menu, the atmosphere was pleasant as were the waiters. What a gem!	1
We had 7 pm reservations and we weren&#39;t seated until 730! The food was very under seasoned.....the wait staff was non existing, but the busy boys were in pint with drink refills. Good thing I always carry tapatio in my purse!!	0

Amazing food attentive service and comfortable atmosphere; the squash gorgonzola pizza is incredible. A great way to end the day! Highly recommend!	1
I shoulda gotten the BBQ. Why, oh, why do I go to places like these and order the thing that is my go-to for Thai, but clearly not the house specialty? The Panang Curry sauce was fine, but the beef that was inside it was very tough (and just a note I like chicken in my Panang). I couldn&#39;t get through it. White rice is extra--whaaat? Just used to that being standard with the meal. Obviously, this is a place where you order the special and don&#39;t diverge from that plan. As it is, I&#39;m not much of a meat on a stick-type person, so I dunno if I&#39;ll be back. If someone else wants to go, I guess I will.	0
I came on a Tuesday with a group of four with a reservation and it was not crowded at all. We didn't even need a reservation , which is nice to know. You have a beautiful view from no matter where you sit and would recommend you sit outside as their heat lamps are VERY warm - I even had to take off my jacket! :) love that-you can never be warm enough outside. If you do have a table when you eat dinner, I would recommend you stay there to have drinks instead of go upstairs. We made a big mistake as there was no room to sit upstairs . The only issue I had was that there was not much variety with the dinner menu and I wish there were more options. This is definitely a perfect date night location though. Very romantic.	1
Really great burgers. Lots of nice menu selections with a Wisconsin theme and locally sourced ingredients. Well thought out beer list, again with a WI focus. Good wines too. We'll be back!	0
Felt like wings and dropped by for a take out. Place was PACKED and loudloud.<br>The wings tasted like spicy pieces of fried cardboard. Is this what everyone raves about?<br>Shame on you	0
Well. Well....well. Daikokuya. Me and Daikokuya, we&#39;ve always enjoyed each other&#39;s company. I&#39;ve been coming here to eat ramen for 9 years, and throughout that whole time Daikokuya has been at the top of my list for ramen. Deep, savory rich broth; chewy noodles and melt-in-your-mouth pork. So good. Heaven. <br><br>I haven&#39;t been by as often as I used to, but this last time marked a huge change. We swung by Monday at 11 am sharp to get a booth. My friend dropped me off out front while he parked. I went in, waited to be sat. There was no one ahead of me, everyone else had been sat, there was a booth and most of the counter open. I waited. I wrote my name down on the list, just in case. I waited some more. Waitresses came and went to the tables, taking orders and bringing food. My friend eventually showed up, having parked and walked over, and we waited some more. Maybe 12 minutes total of just standing there. They&#39;re not supposed to sit you unless you&#39;re whole party is there, but they didn&#39;t know that since they never approached me. Eventually someone wandered over and let us sit at the last booth. Not a good sign, but Daikokuya has spotty service sometimes, and I don&#39;t come for the service anyway. I come for the food. <br><br>We ordered and said food came promptly. I got the fried rice/ramen combo, friend got the pork bowl/ramen. Salad and fried rice was tasty and just as good as it always has been, but my friend&#39;s pork was half-burnt. Still tasty, but half of it was pretty crispy black. <br><br>Then our ramen came out. This is the source of my sadness. You can read the other reviews that attest to the deliciousness of Daikokuya&#39;s broth. What we got served wasn&#39;t it. The broth was thinner, tasteless. It tasted like salt water with some garlic thrown in. No depth, no hidden richness. Just murky salt liquid. The noodles tasted stale and old. They felt mealy and leaden, and there was no chew when you bit into them. They lay in the soup like dead worms. The bean sprouts were same as always, but I found maybe two pieces of bamboo total in the bowl. Sad. The pork was also reliably good, but we both only got two pieces per bowl. I&#39;m pretty sure the serving size used to be bigger. I&#39;ve always found the seasoned egg to be hit-and-miss too, and today it was a miss. Just the barest hint of taste, and the inside was dry, dry, dry. Sad. Also, the waitress completely forgot spoons, and it took a couple tries to get them.<br><br>It&#39;s usually a struggle to polish off a whole bowl of the ramen, and though I normally don&#39;t make it to the end, I put up a valiant fight, polishing off all the noodles and hunting around for those last bits of pork and bamboo that hide out at the bottom of the bowl, drinking as much broth as I can handle. We all waddle out the door and groan about how full our bellies are. This visit, my friend and I both ate half-heartedly till we were full, pushed the bowls away, and got the check. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be back until someone tells me Daikokuya is back as well. Frankly, now that Ramen Jinya has added their tonkotsu black broth to the menu full-time, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll even miss you, Daikokuya. I wish that made me sadder.	0
I am extremely dissatisfied with my experience. <br><br>I drove 2.5 hours to have brunch here with 7 other friends that were joining from out of town. We made a reservation a few days before on Open Table, and my friend called to make sure we would not be charged a fee for having a table of 8. He even called again a few days before to confirm the reservation. Everything was set to go. <br><br>We called the restaurant twice today to mention we would be 15 minutes late, as traffic was heavy, and were surprised that both times, no one picked up. <br><br>We all individually took a car service to the restaurant so we could have bottomless mimosas. We met at the restaurant just to find out they were closed this weekend. <br><br>We never received a call telling us of this inconvenience, and our very limited time together was wasted figuring out another restaurant that was available for a table of 8 within the time period we were together. <br><br>Quite an embarrassment when you have a large group together, confidently confirm plans are two separate times, and are then having to explain yourself when everyone came from out of town for a short reunion. <br><br>Seeing that my time was not respected and they were unorganized, I will be sure to look for other places for bottomless mimosas and delicious food next time I get a large group together!	0
A great place for Japanese food that's relatively affordable in the middle of Little Tokyo.We were seated promptly on a Sunday evening. The staff is polite and courteous, the fish was fresh (it easily melted in my mouth), and the environment is cool, right in Little Tokyo. It's not the best Japanese food, not the best sushi, and not the best environment ever, but within it's price bracket it's very delicious.Their special combos are excellent. I tried a little bit of all the items, including hand rolls, sashimi, rolls, breaded pork cutlet, and teriyaki chicken. I particularly enjoyed all the fish and teriyaki chicken (they made it slightly crispy, I'm a sucker for crunchy/crispy food).We stayed and talked for 2-3 hours, never feeling pressured to leave.	1
Such a great vibe! Jazz brunch was amazing. Staff friendly and helpful. Food was to die for. All in all I could not find one negative thing about this place!	1
I really like the view from the rooftop terrace. Service is a little slow but the view makes up for it.It was never too packed when I was there.	1
Uhhhhhbsessed w this place. Had a couple shrimp tacos ($3.50 each) and masa fries ($2). The other tacos (chicken, carne asada, and others were $3 each. Each taco is about the size of my palm. Guac is $0.45 whooooo! Was so good I went back the next day and ordered the same thing. I very well may go back tomorrow and the day after and the day after that as well. <br><br>There&#39;s enough seating for ~15 people along a wall w stools and a long table. You order at the counter and pick up your food on a tray or togo. <br><br>So yummmmmmmmy. This LA girl approves!	1
We were in Havre de Grace for one night and unfamiliar with the town.  We found the Vineyard on Trip Advisor, and the reviews were spot on.  This was a real gem in an unexpected place.	0
I am a very loyal Langer's patron, and I once doubted I would ever visit enemy territory. Well, I found myself craving pastrami on a Sunday. With Langer's closed I decided to make the trip. I arrived during breakfast hours, and decided on scrambled eggs and pastrami. I was hoping to find it far inferior to Langer's. Well, I found them to be almost evenly matched. Canter's pastrami is machine-sliced, while Langer's is hand-sliced, the superior cutting technique. However, the flavor was comparable, I felt. I also appreciated the "old school" decor, along with Langer's, not having been redone in years. Also, bonus points for being open 24/7 and having a bar connected to the main dining room. I may continue to visit on Sundays and evenings, only when Langer's is closed to minimize my guilt.	1
Best restaurant in LA!! I love this place. Great customer service. Great food. Everything in that restaurant is freshly made and homemade there isn&#39;t any premade bought from the store. Desserts are just mouthwatering. Celebrities don&#39;t come here for nothing! The Six is the place to be!	1
You know sometimes I wish Yelp would have a No star option because here is the proud owner of that option!<br>I do not care if this was the original or not the service was just incredibly horrible. Better yet it deserves all the crap your typical irate customer would say.<br>Down and dirty- took forever just to put 2 tables together to accommodate us even though it was empty. Took long to get our order in, the server had no clue that one of the items even existed... Then he waited to serve the whole table to tell me that they had ran out of my item. No apology- nada- ZERO customer service.<br>By then I just wanted out of that place asap! <br>Get your crap right for crying out loud.	0
Great staff. Simple but delicate food. Amazing buildout. This is definitely where the cool people go when they're hungry.	1
I LOVE the location of this place! It's in a small alleyway in Little Tokyo and it's as hipster as it gets. There's lights hanging everywhere and the brick walls and structure sort of gives it a New York neighborhood feel. You can dress up or down for this place and if it's a nice day outside it makes the place that much better! There was however a drunk lady pouring out her problems to this young man who seemed super uncomfortable and looked like he didn't want to be there and she was playing her own music via her phone...take that part out and it's 5 stars for the ambiance!The food was good. My friends and I shared the Chicken Sautee, Curry Dumplings, Far Bar Burger, and a sushi roll! My favorite was the burger. the bread was more light so it burger wasn't too heavy and the sauce they used was really yums! Everything else wasn't bad, but wasn't omg delicious status. In conclusion, this place is definitely about the ambiance!	1
THE BEST THAI FOOD IN L.A. And the best of all their locations. Been going here since I moved to L.A. 37 years ago. EVERYTHING is good. S-1 and S-2 never get old. Ever.<br>2nd favorites, equally, are their panang, sate, chili squid, tom yum, pad thai, chicken noodle, mee krob, wings of angel, lemongrass mint beef/chicken, shrimp fried rice.... Not fancy, not pretentious, affordable, and great for catering parties.	1
Wonderful soups, big salads! Love it for lunch!Fast service, energetic and polite servers, very popular even in off hours.	1
This place is my favorite! It has a great energy and the perfect laid back cafe environment I'm always looking for--perfect for doing some work or meeting a friend for a bite and coffee. The coffee is delicious and made to order by a knowledgable and charming staff--not to mention good looking! Also, once a month they host an awesome comedy show in the studio in the back with great stand up comics. You can always spot the owners walking around and making sure everything is up to snuff. In one word, this place is SPECIAL.	1
My friend and I came in to BIG &amp; little&#39;s on a day when Chicago was being typical Chicago, i.e. cold and windy (and interspersed with rain and hail). Thankfully, the restaurant was cozy and warm. We&#39;d spent a good deal of time earlier that day reading through the menu and having a hard time deciding what tacos to get (since there are about 20 kinds and they all look amazing), but we were prepared by the time we walked through the door.<br><br>The person taking our orders at the counter was neither BIG nor little (he was wearing a shirt with the word &#34;HUGE&#34; embroidered over the pocket, though), but was very friendly and helpful. I decided to go with the Japanese beef short rib, the al pastor, and the shrimp tacos. For the shrimp, you have an option of getting it either fried or grilled - honestly, I can&#39;t even remember which I got, but it was amazing (and after my experience I trust that whichever the other option was would also be great). Also, pro tip: the tacos usually have two layers of tortilla as a shell, but they are pretty overstuffed with filling, so you can take one of the layers of tortilla and move some of the filling into it. Boom, two tacos that you can eat without spilling all over the place, for the price of one.<br><br>We were wondering how the tacos would compare to Big Star - another favorite taco joint of ours - and the verdict was that while the food was on par (i.e. awesome), it was very different. Even if it was the same taco (I&#39;ve tried the al pastor at both locations), the taste was distinct. What this basically means is that you need to go to both. BIG &amp; little&#39;s has the edge over Big Star for me because it&#39;s both closer to me location-wise and less expensive, but both are great. I have no beef with more restaurants on my list of favorite restaurants. More good food = everyone wins. Yes?<br><br>Swing by BIG &amp; little&#39;s for your taco craving (and really, your burger, banh mi, sandwich, and various other foodstuffs craving)! Bring cash, come hungry, and try everything - I know I&#39;ll be back, maybe for the Phil&#39;s fries or the pork belly po&#39; boy next time.	1
Not many sushi bars open on Sunday afternoon so we gave this place a try and we were pleasantly surprised. Everything was really fresh and the standouts were the uni, toro and spicy salmon roll. The servings were generous and yummy.	1
Saturday lunch: great $15 bottomless mimosas and the food was great.Food: amazing (chilaquiles & veggie burger)Seating: booth/window - super comfortableService: fantastic Overall: must visit!! Great owner, staff and the parking was easy (just visit the street around the back or valet).	1
When I think of thai food near Wilshire, this is the spot. There are others like it, but this one is up in my "yay! I'm a fan" spot.Customer service is VERY friendly and every time I've gone has been an enjoyable experience.Food in general is good, but one dish is just...amazing. The S-1 (their popular Thai BBQ Chicken) is a must-try for every first-time Yelpers here. Their other dishes are meh and can definitely be found in the same amount of "wowness" elsewhere.PARKING: Don't bother waiting around the small lot (you'd think midgets -er, little people-- park here) if you can't find a spot. Just head down the street in the residential area to get parking. This way you won't have to spend forever and a day waiting to get out.	1
From the first bite you can tell that they use really high-quality ingredients. The mozzarella is fresh and chewy. The dough has a great bite to it. Even the olive oil is flavorful.But the thing is, this place ONLY does pizza. No appetizers. No salads. No desserts. Just pizza. And only about 6 different kinds. You can only get an egg and meat (only salami) on Saturdays. What's up with that?!?Oh, and one of the first things you read on the menu is "no substitutions, no slices, no extras". No, no, no. I was a little put off at seeing this.The pizza was good, really. But $25 for a 12-in with just cheese, olive oil and 3 basil leaves was not worth it IMO.	0
Yes, it&#39;s cash only.<br><br>Yes, sometimes the wait can be horrendous. (Even an hour!)<br><br>Yes, sometimes the service can be a little yes or no.<br><br>But it&#39;s worth it, smelling those burgers. When you get your fried fries with ketchup, your hickory-sauced hamburger, and cold soda in triangle cup... only to lead it up to BANANA CREAM PIE!!!<br><br>Oh no, now I&#39;m craving it. XD	1
I meet with a group of friends every Monday that insist on going here....why???? I get sick EVERY time I eat the food...everything is loaded with salt. Now I'm just reduced to eating the fries or the blintzes...BUT I still feel like crap afterwards. I gave it two stars only because of the service and because it has parking.	0
It was a Friday night and I was excited to be going out to dinner with my wife and two close friends. <br>One of our friends recommended The Park and made a reservation for us. The restaurant is clean and the menu is pretty interesting *not amazing but definitely worth checking out*. The issue is the customer service and the saddest part of all is that it is not the staff with the poor customer service, it is the owner!<br>One of the people we were dining with ordered the steak and he was very clear with our server that he likes his steak rare. When his steak got to the table he cut it open to find that it was much closer to medium then to rare... He called over our server and politely let her know what the problem was. Our server took the steak and then returned shortly with a new steak and this time the steak was literally cold inside (at this point I was over all the back and forth but I get that it is difficult to cook meat and so I tried not to be annoyed at the restaurant or my friend for that matter!) what happened next was shocking and uncalled for and I would say that even if I was not a restaurant owner myself...<br>Our friend asked to change his order to the fish, assuming this would be a dish that the kitchen could prepare to his liking. Our server looked like she was going to faint and said just one minute please. The owner of the restaurant came over to our table and proceeded to tell my friend that she could not (really it was will not) allow him to change his order. <br>I know how hard it is to please everyone all the time and I also know how difficult it is to get every staff member to be 100% amazing every minute they are working but I do not have any empathy for someone making such a short sided decision as the one this woman made that ruined my Friday night dinner. It sucks to have to comp a meal but it sucks so much more to lose a table of four who would have ordered more wine and even come back if she had just handled this situation with excellent customer service instead of an embarrassingly low level of customer service.	0
Ray&#39;s is my joint! The charcuterie is second to none. Went there for the &#34;wurst&#34; night and ate an incredible sausage all night. Will definitely go back.	1
I'm very picky when it comes to Mexican cuisine and Cantina Laredo just meets all my expectations,  from the service to the food and the atmosphere,  it was just great!! I truly recommend this to anyone looking for a great place to just relax and enjoy some Mexican food.	1
My daughter told me about this place a few months ago. 	1
I&#39;ve been here a few times - the first time, they were closed...at 8:30pm! What restaurant closed around dinner time?! This!<br><br>So, we went here at lunch time hoping they&#39;d be open. The restaurant is rather small with a bar-stool area and maybe 7 tables. They have fried chicken fingers and grilled chicken. They have sides such as rice, veggies, fries, seasoned fries, dinner roll, etc.<br><br>Mochiko Chicken Bowl:<br>Grilled chicken and rice. I asked for veggies and sauce on the side. The chicken itself was flavorful enough and I didn&#39;t really need the sauce. The sauce was good though. It was like a Hawaiian version of Cane&#39;s sauce. The veggies were a good mix: carrots, broccoli, mushrooms, baby corn, snap peas and red bell pepper. 4/5<br><br>Srirachi Chicken Bowl:<br>Grilled chicken and rice. Veggies added. The sauce was mildly spicy and tasty. 4/5<br><br>Lychee Lemonade:<br>If you like lychee, you&#39;d love this drink. I don&#39;t so, I don&#39;t really have an unbiased opinion about this drink.<br><br>The fried Mochiko chicken fingers look good and huge. Seasoned fries also sound good since I have a weakness for fries. I&#39;ll give them a try next time.	1
I had a savory chicken crepe, and my wife had a sweet almond, chocolate, and pears. <br>The chicken was pretty dry and the mushrooms were from a can. Pretty disappointing. My wife&#39;s: her chocolate was good; her almonds, almost nonexistent, tiny slivers, and her pears hard and unripe.<br>Overall: disappointing. Service was very nice, with a slight caveat: being asked whether I want him to bring me back change wasn&#39;t very nice of him. I left a nice tip anyways. The wait staff should never be punished for the chef&#39;s poor ingredients.	0
I'm not one to review a place but after being sick all night I had to. I took a client out to lunch this week at The Brixton. I generally enjoy this place for cocktails and beers and thought lunch would be a good idea. I ordered a chicken salad. It was fried chicken and sounded pretty good so I went for it. Halfway though it I thought it tasted a little funny so I stopped eating it and wrote it off as just a bad dish. I'm not one to make a big deal and send things back. Later that evening I began throwing up and all the fun stuff associated with food poisoning. It was a long and torturous night reminiscent of my travels in Indonesia. I had meetings all day the next day and had to cancel everything. I was laid up for the entire day and then some. Normally I wouldn't write on Yelp about this. Instead Its my standard to call a Business and tell them whats up. I called during their business hours and left a message. Expecting at least a call back. Nothing. So naturally I thought I would spread the word here. They may be a nice place to visit but I wont be going back nor will my friends. If a business cares about their service then this should be top of the list before any more people get sick. Its obviously not. I'm still not out of the woods yet and I can imagine I'm not the only one. If you want to have a good night and enjoy some great food this is San Francisco, do yourself a favor and go somewhere else.	0
Mickies Dairy Bar is a Madison must-do. Generations of UW-Students, alumni, football fans, locals, athletes and their families all frequent Mickies.	1
2 for friendly service. reasonably clean but the soup was so boring and bland.	0
Man, let me tell ya. My sister lived in Argentina for a year and a half and she is obsessed with it. So, when we found this place she was very excited to go and show me some of the food she fell in love with while there. When I first went in I was terrified cuz, lets be honest, its kind of a grungy dark place. But we sat down and got some bread with the chimichurri sauce and I was hooked. I cant tell you how good that stuff is. If I didnt think that I would get a horrible case of the runs I would pour it on my ice cream and stir it into my drinks.<br>We got some milanesas and empanadas and they were AMAZING! The empanadas were so delicious that I often find my mind drifting to the wonderful moments where I placed the fine morsels of food on my tongue and remembering how my tongue had never felt more loved than at that moment. <br>I recommend this place to everyone. The owner is amazingly nice and the food is fantastic.	1
My fourth visit to the newly redecorated location.  A comfortable ambience.  The food is great...they make their pasta from scratch which is good for lots of points.  They know how to cook calamari properly.  Friendly and knowledgeable wait-staff.  This visit was with four friends for a birthday get together.  They loved it .  My new go to place for lunch.	0
I strolled in here because we were close by. First off, there was a Looooooooong line. We figured the food was good. We were really hungry so we stayed in line. It took forever to get to the front of the line. <br><br>It also states that people should not sit until they have paid. Obviously, people do not follow this rule and the business does not enforce it. <br><br>The topping to the cake was when I finally got to the front of the line and the cashier ignored me. Did not even bother to acknowledge me. A nice &#34;I will be with you in a moment&#34; would have been appreciated. Finally after refunding someone&#39;s money and ignoring me she finally took my order. As I gave her my CREDIT CARD she points to this TINY sign that read &#34;CASH ONLY&#34;. I got sooooooooo pissed because it did not have this sign at the entrance.<br><br>Waste of my time! If you don&#39;t mind poor customer service, long lines, and people to tell you &#34;only cash&#34; once you&#39;ve waited for a million years, then this is the place for you! Otherwise, go somewhere else. I highly encourage people to go elsewhere!	0
Was in Madison for a wedding and was staying at the Hyatt downtown which was across from this restaurant. Reviews were good so decided to try out the lunch buffet and I was not disappointed. They had a bigger than normal selection of items and most importantly it was all fresh. A lot of times indian buffets have food that feels like it is a day or two old but this place each and every item was fresh. The goat curry was da bomb, the meat was tender and the curry had the perfect zing to it. The tandoori chicken was extremely good and fresh and so was the chicken tawa tikka. They even had one indo-chinese item, i.e. chicken manchurian which most indian restaurants screw up really badly but this one was by far one of the best I've had (probably second only to the restaurants on Oak Tree in Edison, NJ).	0
Amazing. Delicious. Fresh!	1
Expensive for a burger and fries (and sometimes pie, too), but ohh so worth it.<br><br>I really enjoy the hickory sauce they put on the hickory burger--so much so that I order a side of it for dipping my fries.<br><br>Don&#39;t come here and expect to get a friendly service. Ever see the Seinfeld episode with the Soup Nazi? The guys behind the counter are his brothers.	1
Tried A LOT of different stuff - Oysters, Shishito Peppers, Salad, and Cheeseburger...they were all great. I prefer their Burger over Umami any day. Great design and surprisingly friendly staff - not what you might expect for a stereotypical hipster spot. I will definitely be coming back.	1
Went with a good friend. We both enjoyed this place. Presentation, flavor and portions sizes were all great. Staff was friendly and accommodating. Had the fried appetizer plate. Veggies, shrimp, a piece of lemon (odd) but so good. The mac n cheese was yummy. I had the skirt steak and potato salad. No knife needed to cut the meat. Super juicy and tender. Will definitely be back. :)	1
I absolutely loved Perch! It has a beautiful view overlooking downtown LA. I went for brunch and the food was delicious and reasonable in price. My plate was about $14 not bad at all. However the drinks are definitely a bit more pricey. I believe I paid about $15 for a cocktail drink. So if you want to avoid paying a high bill I would stay away from the cocktail drinks. <br><br>Last but not least make sure you make a reservation. I went this past Sunday and it took about 20min to get seated so I can only imagine how long people without reservations have to wait. <br><br>Tip: The restaurant is located on the rooftop so look for the name on the building or a security guy outside and you have found it. He will then guide you to the elevator so you can be on your way! (It&#39;s on the 18th or 17th floor I think ) - not sure	1
Heard so much about this new restaurant, so we gave it a try during our thanksgiving visit in LA. Glad that we did it! The food is super YUMMY and Authentic! Very impressed with their special menu featuring unique and rare dishes hardly seen in any other Thai places. Totally love it and will be back when we hit LA again. <br><br>Food we ordered: <br>- papaya salad: my favorite dish! Must try and Very tasty <br>- kua Kling pork: spicy minced pork. my mother in law favorite <br>- Zeed noodles: yumm! <br>- fried chicken: Must try. <br>- crab curry: they put real crab in. Hands required <br>- Thai tea pudding :) <br><br>Venue: thumbs up for easy parking. Though a bit small place but the food is totally worth it. <br><br>GREAT and Friendly Services!	1
Freds is my favorite spot to grab some food. I'm not sure if it's either because it's located in a cool area, it's open 24 hours orrrrr because the grilled cheeses are amaze-balls! There have been many small changes made in the diner over the years, like the menus and the uniform shirts. As far as the menu change goes, i know that you have to ask for a side of fries for your food as opposed to before the fries came with your order. The old uniform shirts were hilarious with witty and interesting expressions written on the back, but i guess they changed it because people got offended.... but, c'mon it's not Fred 62 without those cool shirts!I normally order the club or the grilled cheese and both are to die for! i'm a simple gal and this place is the best to satisfy my simple taste. The banana milkshake is a must try! soooooo yummy!	1
I love this place! I have been cheating on the LA Brewing Co. with you guys for a while now, and you guys have me hooked! I am absolutely adored with the ambiance and design of the place, hidden in between alleys in Little Tokyo. I was first taken here on a date, and was reallly sketched out when he suggested we walk down a dark alley -_-. but then the alley lit up into this amazingly beautiful outdoor patio with lights strung all over the place. Besides the amazing ambiance, they have a great drink selection! I have been searching everywhere for authentic Japanese alcohol and I finally found a place that can provide that. <br><br>Also, the bartenders are very decent looking. I suggest everyone go here, every weekend!	1
So good! I still dream about their burgers and apple pie.I can't wait to go back!!!	1
So so food with poor service	0
Maybe the perfect weather for a Friday night dinner outdoors influenced my rating, but we had a great experience this weekend. I wasn't expecting a lot for a chain.Three of us dined at Francesca's for the first time. With a great view of the Capitol from the outside tables, it made for a great setting.	0
Fried food, while delicious, is not my go-to choice. So when we were heading here I was questioning the decision. Really? We&#39;re going to yet another low quality place that deep fries the cheapest meat they could find and serves it with rice for $10?<br><br>Wrong. I did not know this place was legit. Prices are a couple dollars up, but what you get is much, much better than your run-of-the-mill fried meat spot.<br><br>First of all, there is a little container of sesame seeds that you can crush up and mix with katsu sauce to make a very savory and rich dipping sauce for your katsu. It is delicious. Get it ready, because you&#39;re going to have some of the best katsu you&#39;ve ever had.<br><br>Our dish of pork was served with a high pile of shredded cabbage (?), some rice, and a dressing for the cabbage. The pork itself was breaded and cooked absolutely perfectly. Seriously. The pork was extremely tender and juicy. The crunch on the outside was perfect because it wasn&#39;t too hard, or too greasy. Just right. I couldn&#39;t believe I was actually enjoying it.<br><br>I couldn&#39;t give a bigger endorsement than that. Give them a try.	1
Terrific happy hour, decent beer selection, a huge whiskey list and wings that'll knock your socks off!This place seems a bit hidden in the tiny alley-way entrance, but it is actually attached to the old Chop Suey place next door, and you can get in through there too.But nothing beats the experience of crowding into a narrow alley that opens up onto the luminous and magical area that is Far Bar.	1
My wife and I were in the mood for pizza today and based upon all of the wonderful reviews on Yelp that we had read about Pizza Johny&#39;s we decided to give this place a try. I was surprised when I arrived to find that I had met Johny last year when he was a partner and chef at another Italian restaurant in town. I had enjoyed his food in the past and knew right away that we were going to have a great meal. We ordered a veggie pizza with tomatoes, garlic, black olives, and roasted peppers, plus some garlic rolls. The pizza was honestly the best I had in many years. The dough was amazing and the toppings were very fresh and plentiful. The garlic rolls were baked to perfection and were as tasty as can be. Johny is a very gracious host and made sure that we were well taken care of. He even brought us a little bowl with some extra roasted garlic cloves to add to our pizza. As a special treat Johny remembered how much I had liked rainbow bars in the past and presented my wife and I each with one for dessert. Thank you Johny for the great meal and we look forward to coming back in the near future to try some of the other items on your menu.	1
My girlfriend and I went there for her birthday dinner. I was gonna get the steak but she told me the grouper was excellent. I'm not a big seafood person but I was blown away. The fish was lightly battered with a huge crunch and the fish was soft and tasted great. The shrimp and rice were really good and I don't care for shrimp. I would recommend this to anyone looking to treat someone to a nice meal or just want to get some great seafood.	0
To be fair, the food here worth 4 stars.<br><br>However, I don&#39;t think the service here(if there is any) even worth tipping.<br>Impatient waitress.<br>Have to get yourself drinking water using plastic cup in the middle of the room.<br>Cash only and no bills larger than 20$...<br><br>Seriously? <br>I have got better service in a sandwich stand, which does not require tips at all!	0
Recently, I needed a place in the neighborhood to have brunch with 18 other people, and Bluephies was the choice. We made a reservation weeks in advance. The service and accommodations were beyond fantastic. Our meals came out at about the same time; beverages were refilled in a timely manner. We were able to stay as long as we wanted and the 18 of us had a great time. HOWEVER, the food was Perkins-grade greasy average-ish. Someone was repulsed enough to send their meal back and just stick with the coffee. Still underwhelmed with the food and cannot justify adding any stars.	0
There's not much that's memorable about this place aside from the long line you're going to be waiting in to order and the community seating that will likely leave you a little frustrated. Why will it frustrate you? Because the local yokels will resist sharing the space around them. Don't rely on anyone being decent. You're going to have to elbow your way in. The food, well that was just... meh.Maybe two visits isn't a large enough sample to draw such conclusions from, but that's how I feel after my two times here.	0
My girlfriend and I went here for the first time for our anniversary, and we had a great experience! The food was delicious and the service was impeccable. If anything, they were a little too over zealous in how frequently they checked on us haha<br><br>The food was incredible, and I would come back again only to order the calamari steak and the braised short rib again! Both were unbelievable. <br><br>The place is newer, and they are very clearly eager to please. At times it was too much, but when is wanting to be great restaurant a bad thing?<br><br>It&#39;s a great addition to the area, and I hope to god it is successful as it seems to be the only Moroccan in the area that serves such high quality. I would argue better than a ton of restaurants on the strip, and much more affordable too!<br><br>The decor was also beautiful and we enjoyed seeing the belly dancer while we ate!<br><br>Thank you William and the rest of the team for giving us a wonderful anniversary dinner!	1
Don&#39;t waste your money. The food I got was fine, nothing outstanding though, and definitely overpriced. I spent $8 for 10 small beet cubes. I&#39;m very surprised they charge so much for so little! If it tasted amazing, it might be worth it, but honestly, it was just standard bar food. See photo of beets.	0
Open on New Years Day 2010, they will soon be opened 24hrs. Excellent Chipotle Chicken Wraps and Panini are both savory and sweet and enough to be eaten at once or split into two meals for lunch and dinner.	1
After having to endure a lot of really bad burgers in L.A. it was great too find Whiz. Located at a anonymous corner, this small place offers tasty and original dishes. No pommes was included however and there wasn't much space to stay around and eat there.	1
I guess if I had ordered the sushi maybe the experience would be different. Came in on a Thursday evening on a recommendation from my hotel and the place wasn\u2019t really busy. Asked for a table but the wait staff said they had reservations coming in and would I mind sitting at the sushi bar. Not great but a basketball game was on so I could manage. I was not in the mood for sushi so I ordered some yakitori and yakisobi. And I waited and I waited. 	0
Very elegant space. Delicious raw/vegan. Had the cheezy lime popcorn. Sweet + savory. The Chinoise salad (I still have no idea how to pronounce this) was crunchy and delicious. Finished the night off with the choconut x-tasy which reminded me of a Hail Merry tart or macaroon. <br><br>Excellent list of organic booze and organic and biodynamic wines. <br><br>Great spot to go before a show at the Ahmanson.	1
This place reminds me of large porions of slop on a plate. I got a salad and yes it was huge. the quality was gross and they chicken tasted frozen. The food here years ago was much better. Also I went in a few times and the bread on my sandwich was stale. PASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS	0
The food was okay. Nothing very special. There was not much space to sit. Two tables in side and two out side. My boyfriend and i had no space to sit and it was too chilly to be outside, so we decided to eat in the car...	0
Gertrude's on Tuesdays is THE place to be as many of the entrees are $02.00. Crab cakes are outstanding  &amp; fried chicken is the best in town. The cream of crab soup is filled with back fin crab and very rich. Wait staff is knowledgeable and attentive. Sitting outside in spring, summer and fall can't be beat, over- looking the Baltimore Museum of Art's Sculpture Garden. The owner, John Schields, is a serious and knowledgeable foodie and that is reflected in his menu.	0
Pretty on par with your average Indian buffet. Except the portions are really small and the hostess was incredibly rude.	0
I had been to G and the Goat and found the food to be so oversalted that it was nearly inedible. Sadly, my experience there was twinned at the Little Goat. The decor of the restaurant is adorable, and the boisterous diner vibe is nicely conducive to meeting up with your pals. So I was hopeful. I ordered the root vegetables and boo boo baise. The vegetables were cold and seasonless, and the boo baise while a nicely generous portion was so oversalted that I ate trepidatiously. My friend ordered the tempura mashed potatoes which were just ok though I admired the weirdness of trying to fry a mashed potato. Another friend ordered the Japanese pork item--and was surprised to find it unattractively sandwiched within white bread. I tried it and the pork was chewy and...salty. At some point I began to feel ill...I don&#39;t know if it was the salt, the quality of the mussels (which on first gulp tasted &#34;off&#34; to me and I only ate one), but later in the night I was ill. I actually had to leave early because the smell of salt and grease and bad acoustics were making me feel worse. I have to say, I think Chef Izard&#39;s personality from watching her seems very warm and full of great energy, but I have never felt that translated into her food. I think the biggest perpetrator is the SALT but also the presentation of the food...just slopped onto the plate with no real artform. I later explained to another friend why the experiences at these restaurants turned me off, and he offered Avec as a great example of a small plates restaurant that uses interesting meats and combinations but it&#39;s always artful, beautifully prepared and presented and you feel really connected to what you&#39;re eating. I can&#39;t connect to food when it is so doused in salt.	0
The late night food selection in LA is for the most part pretty pathetic. I can&#39;t even remember how many times I found myself at a Denny&#39;s or Norm&#39;s at 3am wondering why I was eating a dish I would never think to order sober while sitting in a depressingly sterile space. <br><br>I like Canter&#39;s because it obviously caters to a drunk crowd looking for a nosh post-bar but it still has a lot of character and yummy selections. After perusing the ginormous menu for a long time, I settled on the potato pancakes last night. You can choose a side of apple sauce or sour cream but of course I went with both and was not disappointed. I liked the flavor but I didn&#39;t think it seemed super fresh and piping hot. Those who got Canter&#39;s famous pastrami sandwiches seemed very pleased with their selections, especially the warm chips, although we were told that they&#39;re not homemade as we thought. <br><br>The late night service was very friendly and efficient, though it did take a little while for our stuff to come out. The guy at the cash register up front was very chatty and cool as well, and even complimented my dining date Katie B on her lovely pink onesie pajamas. <br><br>It&#39;s a comfy and cool place to go when you&#39;re starving and don&#39;t want the night to end yet!	1
I have always appreciated the service here. And I like the vegetarian options too.	1
First time eating here and I was very pleased. Turkey salad on challah bread is very good. Matzo ball soup is hot and delicious, though I would like to see more veggies in the soup and the option of a smaller portion. Tomato pickles are delectable too.	1
I brought my brother and sister in law here from out of town because of the rave reviews for how good the chicken is. He ordered the grilled garlic soy ones and she got some of the crispy variety. The verdict: they were "alright". The potato wedges were decent for potato wedges. I mean you can basically get the same quality at KFC or some fast food joint. The exceptionally bad thing was the service. It was downright the worst dining experience I've had since maybe high school denny's late night. We place our order. It seriously took like 45 minutes for them to bring it out... well, part of it out. After asking 3 times for sauce for the wrap we had to get up and go to the front and get it ourselves. they never brought the rice balls, the broccoli salad or one of the drinks. Mind you, this is maybe one step above a fast food joint. There were no other parties dining in and at least 9 people working behind the counter. The buzzer on our table was broken. They never brought the check. They didn't apologize. We finally got up and went to the front and asked for the check THEY CHARGED US for all of the items they didn't bring! Then they took forever to take it off the bill and as we were leaving one of the employees leaves for a smoke break and is blocking our exit. My worst experience dining in LA ever!	0
Had a good...nice place...would go again. The only thing I would criticize is the crab cake was delicious but had a spring summer kinda flavor to it	0
The only reason to come here is for the view. The food is not worth the price. It actually wouldn&#39;t be worth the price if they dropped it by 10%. I would guess the happy hour specials would make the price for drinks more reasonable. The only way I am going back is if I just plan on having drinks.	0
Love the murg bahar!	1
Dear Greeks,<br>Your food is far from the Best ever, Turkish food trumps Greek, hands down. Your wine is borderline wretched, and don&#39;t insult me by telling me you don&#39;t carry Baklava, when a. I was addressing my bf with what texture I wanted for dessert b. Don&#39;t tell me what to order, when I know more about your cuisine and my bf knows more about wine pairings and yes that includes your wine and lastly, c. your desserts are not so delectable that you must pressure me to order one every 2 min after my entree. <br><br>Ya, skip this place, go Turkish! ;)	0
I&#39;ve been meaning to do this for a few months. We have ordered about 4 or 5 times and every time it came quickly and the food is amazing! ( delivery guy is very sweet) <br>We always order cheeseburgers and either regular fries or onion rings- all AMAZING and the fries are crispy when they arrive. <br>Don&#39;t hesitate, order right now... We are! <br>PS. Their brownies are worth the splurge :0)	1
The food is very good.  Gourmet quality.  Portions modest, which I think is good.  Service was very good:  attentive, without being overbearing,m and pleasant.  My only negative is that it is exceptionally expensive.  If it is four stars for the food and service, it is five stars for price.	1
I am a big acai bowl fan, and this is by far the best acai bowl you can get in southern California. In Southern California alone, I&#39;ve tried Banzai, Earthbar, Liquid Juice Bar, Birdie Bowls, etc. They don&#39;t really come close to preserving the delicate flavor of the acai berries.<br><br>I scooped a generous spoonful from the bowl, took a bite, and fell in love with the fact that I could taste the individual ingredients that were put into the mix. The bowl was good to the end, unlike bowls I&#39;ve had at places that use apple juice to sweeten the bowls (Banzai). Their bowls tends to taste more and more like apple juice as I get to the bottom. The bowl I got was lightly sweetened with agave. I asked them to put in less agave than the amount they usually put in, and the staff was very accommodating and friendly.<br><br>Also, If you have had an acai bowl, you will agree that fresh toppings really add to the whole experience. I took a peek inside the truck, and I saw them peeling and chopping the fruits themselves, so I knew the toppings were fresh. Overall, I am very excited that this truck&#39;s gonna be coming around my work. Come more often to West LA, please!	1
I didn't get to eat there but the drinks, decor and view of downtown was great! I love it! going up two elevators was a little scary for all of you scared of that sorta thing..... It's super frenchy and beautiful establishment. Doesn't open until 4 or 5pm I believe. Only thing is drinks and descriptions all have fancy names.... They had another name for bitters.... Kinda felt dumb asking what all the different words meant.... Regardless, the drinks all tasted great! Would def go back and try out the food!	1
Best meal I've had in a really long time. I'm visiting from new york and the food was better than most places in new york. My boyfriend is from key west and is very critical about key lime pie and he thought dom's key lime pie was really good. The hanger steak and ricotta gnocchi was excellent. Service was ok. Atmosphere was good.	1
really old furniture and not in a charming way but in an unstable way. the bubble tea with raspberry i had was bad. i politely asked them to change it to something else and i think it was the manager who told me i'm sorry we don't do that when the customer doesn't like it. it has to be a defective product......i just gave her the drink and walked away. 	0
The food is pretty good! Great atmosphere and a great location but it was disappointing because their staff forgot everything even when we reminded them twice.. Staff are friendly but by the end of our night we still didn&#39;t get what we asked for.	0
Fairness b. stay home and watch the voice please. The world will be better. In fact, just stay home always.	1
Great watering hole for east side yuppies that serves up wonderful frozen margaritas. Try the swordfish tacos or the chicken mole. Reasonably price but book as a recervation for Thurs through Saturday nights as it can become crowded.	1
It pains my heart to write this update but my husband & I ate there last week and the food was WACK. Like I can't even talk about how awful each dish was (we ordered 2 apps and 2 entrees) Plus it took over 20 mins to get us our first drink. I asked the waitress nicely what was going on... She didn't really have a good answer. There are so many places to go in this area just keep it moving.	0
Been here twice, once during their busy nights, and another after a workday.The place is nice, easily missed, but that adds to the exclusivity of knowing about it.Pretentious LA, I love it already.Decent food, wasabi ranch fries are bomb. Full bar, good music (electro-house mixes), and a projector of random movies play against the brick walls. The servers are attentive and Far Bar is one of those places you'd expect people to bar hop through. Space gets cramped by the bar easily so bear with it.	1
Popped in for a quick bite. Decent neighorhood hangout. Food is basic french fare but nothing particularly stands out.. Coquet Monsier was fine but felt it needed a better cheese and was under-seasoned. Would try again but only if I'm in the area.	0
Excellent place. The food was outstanding! The sangria was a little disappointing. We sat inside where it was cozy and quiet, but they had a group playing outside for those who wanted a more lively environment.	1
Came here with a friend yesterday for Brunch. Amazing!We both did bottomless mimosas - YAASSWe shared the Waffle Sliders - Bomb!I had the Will's Pan Scramble with Turkey Sausage and Toast - Very good!She had the Short Rib Mac 'n' Cheese grilled cheese with Fries - She was in HeavenService was great, staff were friendly and for brunch it was awesome.There is parking across the alley way behind the restaurant - Free all dayI will definitely come back for lunch and dinner.	1
SOOOOOOOO happy this little gem has moved into the neighborhood. Everything I ate & drank were outstanding!!!	1
Okay, so we went here during summer restaurant week -- so I feel a bit bad scoring so low. But, we went on Thursday night...they had 5 days to perfect the food right? WRONG! The food did not taste remotely good. Everything was so bland, no flavor at all. I was so disappointed that we spent $50 on our meals. Every course was disappointing I had the Gazpacho to start as an appetizer while hubby had corn fritters. Mine was bland and tasteless, said it had avocado in it...literally like 2 small chunks. The corn fritters were globs of grease, just gross. Dinner I had potato dumplings with veggies..just bland, nothing exciting. Hubby had olive oil poached halibut..again nothing to write home about, and very small portion. Desserts were no better, which we were expecting to be since La Brioche does in fact have a great bakery. The best part of the meal was the bread basket...how sad. Our server had no personality or charm -- I even asked her if she was sick of restaurant week or what...she just grunted something back. La Brioche True foods = Truely disappointing.	1
So $90 for 2 people... That&#39;s with 2 glasses of wine that were already half off for happy hour. That&#39;s fine... But when you&#39;re approaching nearly $50 a person... The food better be incredible. The escargot butter parsley sauce was under seasoned and bland. Not once did a server quality check with us in them. The French onion soup was way too sweet... Maybe too much brandy. But no quality check once again. Then the cheese board was fine... But our server(s) did not explain what cheese was what... So it&#39;s just lackluster and lazy... Or just not caring. I hate eating soft cheese with soft bread... It&#39;s so much more enjoyable with a crostini or toasted baguette... I asked a few times and was not warned but charged $3.50 for 2 small baguette slices that were toasted. <br>My partner and I live right here in this neighborhood.. We will not be back.	0
Sorry. Looked super cute. But after waiting 50 mins for a slice of cheese on a plate for $15, we gave up. Thanks for the comped wine, but seriously. Why does it take 25 mins for toasted sliced bread to accompany our cheese, and another 45 mins for hamachi (code for uncooked fish!)? Not our game baby. Not our game!	0
First I just want to say that this review is actually not about the food but the awful service I experienced last Sunday when I stopped in. So I walked in last Sunday with 2 friends around 4pm. The place was surprisingly empty, maybe 2 tables filled and a few people sitting at the bar. I&#39;ve been here a couple of times before and really enjoyed the food. As soon as we walked in the &#34;host&#34; or server not sure exactly tells us that they don&#39;t have a full menu. We say sure no problem since we really just wanted some tapas and wine not a full dinner. He leads us over to one of the main tables in the middle and I asked if we could sit in the corner booth since we had shopping bags. He said &#34;no, that&#39;s only for parties of 4 or more&#34; . I was annoyed since the place was EMPTY!! I would totally understand if it was packed but again there were only 2 tables occupied. But again my friends and I are tired and really wanted some wine. So we said sure no problem and proceed to the table, this is one of those big communal tables in the middle so my friends and I sat down but left the seat at the head of the table empty. The server/host man comes over and asks my friend to please sit at the head of the table. My friend was just confused and he kept insisting that she sit at the head. At this point, I was just completely annoyed at this man for trying to consolidate us into a small corner of the table instead of allowing us to sit comfortably. Again the crazy part about this was that the place was EMPTY!! At that point I did not feel that I should give my money to a place that would treat paying customers in such a rude manner. I was actually a fan of this place but will definitely think twice before I ever step foot in this place again.	0
I really like this spot. It&#39;s a little hidden gem tucked away off the street and it&#39;s a perfect choice as a low-key date spot or a chill first stop on a night out in Little Tokyo or DTLA. <br><br>They have an awesome selection of beer, whiskey, and scotch and they have a great late night happy hour food menu. The tacos are super good. <br><br>You really can&#39;t go wrong.	1
The burger was cooked well and tasted like something I could have made at home. Thus I am torn to give it two stars because the pies was excellent. (Apple &amp; Banana Cream)<br><br>Maybe if I was a BH91201 fan I would have rated this higher. ;)	0
Love this spot! Coca cola asada nachos are the biz! Super chill spot, staff is friendly, beers are awesome. Go check it put if you haven't yet.	1
The burgers here are nothing special, too much lettuce on my burger. Fries, mediocre. Service was okay.	0
Loved the atmosphere, prices reasonable. Nice service	1
This restaurant is in a neat little spot! We wanted to explore a little bit of our Los Angeles and wound up here for dinner. They started us off with chips and homemade salsa. The salsa was delicious! <br><br>The owner and everyone working there were friendly and they gave us the perfect time to think about our options. I ordered a watermelon juice with penne pesto pasta topped with grilled chicken and the boyfriend ordered an horchata with what they call The governor&#39;s plate. His meal came with steak, veggies, and either a small soup of the day which was a tortilla soup or a sald. He chose the tortilla soup and it was divine! His steak was medium well and it was perfect on how they executed it. Some places you say medium well and it comes rare or so. <br><br>I enjoyed my penne pesto and I could not stop munching on it. The grilled chicken was tender and juicy, not dry at all didn&#39;t have that microwave feel to it if you catch my drift. <br><br>Overall, this is a great location owned by a wonderful family! Definitely needs to be checked out by all of those who call LA home!	1
Five-Star taste with five-star service! The restaurant is a little dark but very romantic and you cannot get this great of service and food for this price in Seattle! Menu is about $15-$30/plate.	1
So I ordered take-out from 3 Chefs even after a buddy of mine told me not to ever eat there. I disregarded his advice and was craving chinese food at a fair price. I decided to order the orange chicken with white rice as it seemed safe. The chicken came in huge chunks of soft microwaved tasteless morsles that I immediately stopped eating after one piece. I asked my roommate to try a bite to see if I was crazy. But I am not crazy. That chicken was terrible. The rice was ok, but how can you screw up rice? I will not be coming back here every again. Even if its just for a diet coke.	0
For a person that really doesn&#39;t like fish (there&#39;s something terribly unappetizing about the smell of putrid seawater), I still enjoy an occasional meal at the Fish House. <br><br>The smoked fish spread is addicting and I could probably just eat that on those delicious captain wafers if given the choice.<br><br>The last time I went, I had the pasta with pink sauce (it wouldn&#39;t be fair to call it Vodka sauce...) and shrimp. The shrimp was cooked perfectly and the sauce was very tasty. Definitely worth having, especially when it&#39;s offered as a special.<br><br>Our pitcher of beer was a little flat and had a piece of foil from a wine bottle in it, but otherwise it was reasonably priced and not worth complaining too much about.<br><br>I think my biggest pet peeve with Fish House is the music. In one room they usually have some crappy live band playing terrible covers or even worse, original songs. And if the gods find it favorable and you&#39;re lucky enough to be seated far away from said crappy band, prepare to endure XM&#39;s Best of the &#39;60&#39;s station directly competing with the house music. Is this type of torture absolutely necessary, Fish House? <br><br>Anyway, aside from that, the place is really comfortable and relaxing to eat at so definitely give it a try. :)	1
Located at the top of Pershing Square, this is a quaint lounge/bar with a 1960's aura of elegance and sass. The waiters and bartenders were all super cute with their bow-tie outfits, pinstripe slacks and wing-toe loafers.I'd stay away on the weekends because it gets so damn packed, but the perfect weeknight spot for light drinks and catch up with the girls. Try duck, duck, goose with the French Cab as you stare off into the starry night, you'll forget you're in LA and think you're somewhere in Europe.	1
Haven&#39;t had the food yet because I&#39;ve been waiting for 2 hours when they said it would be an hour wait. They need to fix their management and learn how to seat tables correctly. It&#39;s not rocket science. Too bad as I had high hopes for this place.	0
Monday Night Supper! Love this place... They have the Monday special which includes appetizer, entree and dessert for $15. Everything on their menu is very good. The inside bar area is really cool with some nice drinks on the menu. I used to frequent here all the time when I lived in Los Feliz. Will be back for sure!	1
Placed an order trough GrubHub at Meat, order went through, money was withdrawn from my account, no food. Over an hour later I checked the status of my order, it said my food was being prepared. Sometime later I received a call from GrubHub. The representative provided a half-hearted apology and stated that the restaurant closed after accepting my order and taking my money... So now it&#39;s late, my money will not be reimbursed for several days, and I have no food... Poor customer service on the part of Meat to a first/last time customer, and terrible customer service on the part of GrubHub to a regular/former customer. Very disappointing and unprofessional! Shame on you Meat and GrubHub!!!!!	0
I always want to like this place because it&#39;s so convenient if you intend to go out after dinner, but quite frankly it&#39;s just not that good and the service is really not that nice.	0
I've just been there for lunch, but the soup was tasteless, I don't want to go anymore. Disappointed!	0
My girl had mentioned she had a certificate to the corner . We live so close by , that I decided to join her . The service was amazing . Thanks to terry , I was able to taste the pork sandwich (can't remember the full name.. Lol) but dammmm was it good . The only thing I would've like is to have a pitcher of mimosas vs the server coming every few times to refill on the bottom less . For that reason I give it 4 and not 5 . Besides that , all was dope ...	1
I was looking to a place to grab some breakfast in between classes and I soon as I walked in D&#39;oro I was welcomed by Luciana. She was really nice and explained the menu for me. I sat on the outdoors are which is really nice despite that is in the middle of Downtown. The food was delicious and the coffee was great. The price was reasonable for the food quality and the ambience. I would totally come back to D&#39;Oro.	1
I try and go here once a week; they literally have the best pastrami ruben I have ever had, and that's coming from someone who lived in a few hassidic areas in the past (typically these places breed great delis). Seriously though, they are infinitely better than Langer's and all the other places that people seem to rave about in LA. There just isn't anything better if you are looking for something reminiscent of an NY deli and are prepared for one of the best sandwich experiences of your life. Oh, and their baked goods and bagels are pretty good too.	1
On a recent visit with my family to Local 360 we were asked to wait 10-15 minutes for a table because of a server shortage. After 15 minutes we were seated only to wait another 20 minutes with no service. The restaurant was not that busy. Without rambling on the concept here is good. The food is not too bad. The service is terrible. We even wrote to the management staff and never received a reply. There are plenty of great restaurants out there folks. Don't be fooled. Try Tilikum Place Cafe if you want to be in Belltown. Great food and service!	0
I had been wanting to treat my partner to his first pho experience for a while now and could not wait any longer to do so. I searched up places at 11 pm hoping for a place to be open and read that they offered Thai food here as well, how amazing! If he did not like pho then I knew he was a huge Thai lover just in case. Even though it was a bit out of our way we went and now it has become a regular spot and we love coming here. I have had better pho and more specifically Thai food at other places but for the price and the hospitality we always get when we go there, you can&#39;t beat it.	1
My overall experience was terrible. Not only did the waiter give me the wrong fries, the ketchup bottle was disgustingly dripping in ketchup with a weak pouring spout that fell off and spilled all over my food. Not to mention there was a fly in my water. Disappointed but I guess everyone else has different experiences.	0
The salmon is always amazing!!<br>This place has a great vibe for the after work crowd. <br><br>The Bulldog is my favorite drink, just enough sweet and just enough spicy. <br>The servers are attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. <br><br>One thing to watch is the valet though. Had something stolen from my car and they refused to return it. Annoying because there is no real street parking, so make sure that your stuff is locked up. <br><br>-Bryan	1
I&#39;m giving 2stars b/c I&#39;m happy to have a bar near my apt. and the atmosphere was nice. But the food needs some serious help. The lemon pepper poached shrimp was ok, the andouille sausage po boy was average but the blackened catfish po boy was inedible. I&#39;m chalking this one up to first week jitters. At least I hope that&#39;s all it was.	0
It is to be expected that a place in this locale would be touristy, and indeed it is. However, the vendors here put other food courts to shame. Can&#39;t make it to Smorgasburg? Want to try some of the most popular businesses in the city, in one place? Hudson Eats might be the choice for you.<br><br>Num Pang, Black Seed, Mighty Quinn, and Dos Toros are all here, churning out the same quality product you get at their other locations. <br><br>There is plenty of seating, whether at a booth, table, or high-top, and it is all super clean. <br><br>Unlike a traditional mall food court, this is a bit more high end, but not unaffordable. <br><br>I&#39;m a fan despite the slack-jawed clientele, simply because I can get a bagel, some brisket, a cupcake, and a hoisin meatball sandwich without having to travel to four separate brick-and-mortar joints. Viva good eats and gluttony.	1
Very chick, modern little place downtown LV .... Love the open space and the food is absolutely good!!!! Don&#39;t miss out on the pasta with currants, anchovy almond dish, it&#39;s really good	1
Hmm I guess Hunters just wasn&#39;t a great match for me. I found the cocktails to leave much to be desired, especially with Clover Club being directly across the street. I expected more from the food as well, given the great reviews. I ordered the Kale salad to start, followed by striped bass with faro, wanting to dine on the healthy side. The Kale salad was excellent, though heavy for a salad. I would have been happy if that were my entree, even shared. Then came the bass. I was expecting it to be prepared light and fresh, yet instead found a bass masked behind way too much butter, salt, and cream. I could hardly eat half, and a week later, I still feel a bit sick thinking about it. Yes it is winter, and the theme of the restaurant is a rustic, animal heavy place. But I found myself searching with my fork for a bite of something less engorged in fat and salt, which is never a good sign. In my opinion, good food should not have to hide behind the flavors of fat and salt; they should rather be used to highlight the flavors of quality natural ingredients. I am not butter-phobic by any means, but I left here feeling heavy, and could taste the cream on my tongue for the next hour after my meal. Unfortunately, Hunters was not for me. But if you&#39;re looking for a heavy meal with huge portion sizes and interesting food, maybe it&#39;s your kind of place.	0
Authentic Mexican restaurant with high quality , fresh ingredients from local farmers. Eric is very thoughtful and passionate about his restaurant. His recommendation scored high with me and my 10 year old girl. It&#39;s a fun, unpretentious place with a pool table and cool vibes. Really delicious food and creative menu. You should try the Asada Fries and get a taste of Heaven!	1
Right, first off let me start off by saying that this rating is for my most recent visit to the Blue cow, and if I were to exclude this I&#39;d give Blue cow about a 4 1/2 star rating overall. That being said, my last visit was a pretty big and long series of blunders on the part of Blue cow staff and management. <br><br>I went to Blue cow on Oct 21st to get a burger (mario style). I had called ahead to order to go and walked over. The food was ready when I arrived but unfortunately the payment systems were down. No biggie I thought since my server Paul was rushing around to different stations to get it done. However, it took over 20 minutes to finally pay for my food, and of course, by the time I got down to eating my burger, it was cold. I was offered an apology but nothing else. Well, not really the restaurant&#39;s fault and I was pretty much ready to forgive this one transgression.<br><br>Unfortunately, this was not the end of it. Checking my credit card statement online a few days later, I discovered that I had been double charged for my burger. I promptly called Blue cow to get a refund and was assured by the manager (John) that it&#39;d be taken care of and that I&#39;d receive a phone call back once it was done. A week later I&#39;d still not gotten a call or a refund. <br><br>I was once again eating in the Water Court so I decided to pay visit in person and asked to speak with the manager (think her name was Michelle) to get a refund. Wrote down all my credit card information, and once again, was promised a phone call and refund. Once again, nothing.<br><br>Finally had to call my credit card company to dispute the charge and congrats Blue cow, you finally made me sign up for yelp and post my very first review.	0
LOVE these guys!!! The soy garlic wings are fraking WIN.	1
Horrible waitstaff, they barely responded at all. The food was abysmal, the authentic chinese food was awful, and the american-chinese food was tasteless and both are expensive. Do not go.	0
We were surprised to learn that Bouchon has been in Vegas for 12 years. The food and service were excellent. Much better than Bouchon in Beverly Hills. Our wiatress Arlene was great and made our dining experience even better.	1
Fortunately, I don&#39;t rate foods on authenticity. Unfortunately, I still wouldn&#39;t recommend this restaurant to anyone in the middleteranean or elsewhere.	0
I am ambivalent about Paper or Plastik. --On the one hand, the inside looks a lot like Colectivo Coffee by the lake in Milwaukee (the old flushing station), which made me feel very at home. (Other reviewers are calling the decor "hipster." I think that's cute--what is normal to Milwaukeeans is hipster to Angelinos). --On the other hand, the prices are outrageous. A cup of coffee for over $4? Really? On what planet is ordering a latte over a cup of coffee a cost-saving measure? Oh, Los Angeles, you kill me. --But the blueberry pop tart pastry is yumtastic. --But the breakfast plate, while good, is $12, and a bowl of soup is $11. (The guy next to me ate only a little bit of his soup because it reminded him of baby food. I didn't try it).--But the sweet potato & French feta sandwich is tasty and unique. I wouldn't have come up with that combination, and it really really worked. See why I'm torn?	1
Spectacular food, the best Gnochis ever. The food was amazing fresh and delicious. As for the service it is not run of the mill family restaurant the owner is running around and relatives are making sure your food and dining experience is good. Would recommend hands down..	1
Great. Old school. Jewish Deli. I came here for lunch and got a Pastrami sandwich to go, so I can't attest to the sit-down experience. Up front they have a deli counter and pastry counter for people getting food to go. Then in the back they have a big dining room with an old school counter. The Pastrami sandwich was very good. Soft, flavorful rye bread and thinly sliced meat (much thinner than Langer's). The mustard was good and the sandwich was pretty stacked. This sandwich is a little bit small overall (diameter-wise) compared to some others. This isn't my favorite in town, but I'd take it as a solid lunch option.When I was waiting for my sandwich, I was captivated by the pastry counter. In a moment of incredible sugar-induced weakness, I ended up buying an enormous apple turnover and a Black and White cookie.The turnover was ABSOLUTELY incredible. Possibly the best turnover I've ever had. Apples were tender, crust was flaky. Sweet but not too sweet. And there was possibly an entire pound of butter in my turnover alone. Thumbs way up. However, as a connoisseur of fine NY-style Black and White cookies, I can tell you: this one sucked, haha. It was really dry on the inside. Hardly the scrumptious yellow cake cookie that you expect. The frosting was okay, but without a solid cookie base, what do you have?	1
Really!? that's how many chips I get? Really!? So, basically I have to order seventeen orders of chips and salsa to get what's normally given as one order. Anyway, I'm in the hood and ate here like twenty times and though always thought it pretty good, but nothing special, I was always annoyed at service, which was done with an indelible frown, and their 75 percent screw up my order rate. Just competent unauthentic Mexican food, who screw up my to go order and seem to have severe chip shortage, I mean your only job is to make like five different meals that consist of the same basic six ingredients, I can't imagine it's that hard, but somehow the meal is always wrong??!!. I now go to Chihuahua's in my hood, but really, the Mission is still the place!!	0
I eat here at least 3 times a week. I work close by and it&#39;s my immediate go to. Everything is affordable and great quality food. The guy Manuel that runs it makes you feel like you&#39;re at home. And you can&#39;t beat 99cent tacos after 5pm	1
So freaking good and Authentic. Service with a smile doesn&#39;t come naturally, a little of attitude is served on the side, BUT, juicy burgers compensate for the lack of courtesy anywhere I go!	1
Regardless of the criteria by which you judge POT--food, service, value, ambiance--it will woefully let you down if you have ever been to any half decent Korean place before. My dining companion described the experience as being forced to ride a child's tricycle, after already completing the Tour de France. Every flavor is muted. The personalities of the staff are muted. The lighting is muted. The bill, however, screamed: $73 for lunch, no beverages. Avoid at all cost-there isn't enough concrete or pretension in the world to save this place.	0
I'm really a fan of this place. Not only is it open 24 hours but it's also got a crazy good selection of beef broths, soups, jigaes and more. We ordered the oxtail soup, the beef shortrib soup (galbitang) and the spicy pork neck stew (gamjatang). All of them were hits. I could eat here every week. I think pricing was somewhat on the higher side however, which is why it's not a 5-star rating in my book.	1
Delicious, I love the food, the vibe, the people, this is a great place to eat a burger, relax, and take a quick pause before heading back out into the LA fray.	1
It's ok. Nothing spectacular, nothing horrible. Ordered salad, pate, and pork belly apps-nothing really blew us away but it wasn't terrible. Steak frites and rabbit leg again meh, I've had better, I've had worse. I'm not sure if I would go back.	0
A good break from the norm, The Original Big Tomato serves up some of Miamis best deep dish pizza. Most the pies are in a personal size around a twelve inches and also a medium pie if you want to share. They have a wide selections of toppings and specialty pizzas to choose from. They also have a bunch of soups and sandwiches on the menu and some good drinks like Dr. Browns soda. Its mostly take out here but they have seating for about ten people. <br>If you feel like you need a break fron NY style slices and want some good deep dish this is the spot	1
Good coffee, good sandwiches and all day breakfast.	1
I had the Dynamic Duo- a 5 oz crab cake and 3 jumbo shrimp. I love shrimp, it is one of my favorite things to eat so I was excited to eat jumbo shrimp. The shrimp, however came out butterflied and flat. This can be great for cooking them faster, but for me, it almost always results in over cooked, rubbery, tasteless shrimp. So that was a disappointment. The crab cake, was however, the best one I have ever eaten.  My husband, who is allergic to fish, indulged me by coming along. There are non-fish options, more than at some other seafood places we've tried. He got a steak and, while it came out to his specified done-ness, the meat itself was bland. The atmosphere is nice. We chose to avoid the toll way, so the drive from PG county was a bit long and the area looks kinda questionable at night (we had to drive through an industrial section to get there). There is free parking and the restaurant itself and the parking lot is well lit and attended, so that was a bonus.  All in all, I wasn't angry that we chose to eat there but I don't think we'll be going back.	0
This space delivers on service and food with portions to please all. The staff has a sense of humor and are helpful as you navigate a menu with so much to choose.  The asparagus fries are crispy, steaks tender, salad plentiful, so don't over do it or you won't have room for dessert as I did. Oh well next time for the sweets!	1
The burgers are pretty tasty, however, the service here (as at the other Umami I have been to, in Toluca Lake) is chock full of pretension and rudeness. I ordered three burgers to go and the bill came to over $34. The prices are truly exorbitant. The restaurant was deserted when I came to pickup my order, but it still seemed like I was inconveniencing the bartender. After establishing that mine was their sole order at the time. He slammed my bill down as he went to shove my burgers in a brown paper bag the likes of which my mother used to pack my PB&Js in when I was five. He then took my payment and didn't give me a receipt (which I needed since I was ordering for work). When I asked for it he said, "I gave it to you, right?" Wrong. Of course this irritated him and after sighing loudly he managed to do his job and print the receipt, which was also slammed down on the bar. I took my sack of food and got the heck out of there as fast as possible.My manly burger retained the lingering taste of rudeness. The food probably would've been better if I hadn't had to deal with the diva bartender. I guess no one told him he works at a burger place. He reeked of entitlement (like every other Umami employee I've ever had the misfortune of dealing with) and it tainted my lunch.There's a Jack In The Box nearby I would recommend going there instead, at least their food isn't overpriced, you get speedy service, and it usually comes with a smile.	0
REALLY GOOD!! Pizza was great, staff was awesome, wings are crazy good (grilled, not fried which is amazing!) and that&#39;s pretty much all there is to say. I think the prices were decent, I had a medium pizza and 5 or 10 wings (can&#39;t remember) and I paid like $20.. That really isn&#39;t that bad considering the quality ingredients they use and the prices of other pizza places.. Definitely worth trying. I love the fact that the this is probably the healthiest pizza place ever.	1
This place was recommended by a few friends so I thought we should check it out. Once we sat down and looked at the menu's I realized we were basically in a Chili's or an Applebee's Plus. Friendly waiter made it better. The food average and cost more than it should. About an hour after dinner I had to run to the toilet. Not good. Something I ate there is dying to get out. Totally sharted a few minutes ago. WTF! We spent $60 on one beer a kid's meal, a steak, and a burger with fries. And I have diarrhea now. Don't think I'll be going back. Seems popular though. Not sure why.	0
Very nice place, great atmosphere but the services was not good at all and very pricy	0
I REALLY like this place! It is a great lunch spot and the hummus ROCKS. I like the sausage dishes the best and have not expanded my choices. But my dining companions always seem to enjoy whatever they order from the menu as well. It is a bit chilly in there sometimes, but well worth going to. Since things are made on the spot it can take a bit of time to get your order....but it is worth every bite!	1
Favorite all time deli. The food & bakery all very good!	1
One word: delicious!	1
man oh man, this place was a disaster. made a reservation for this past friday night - the host and hostess were very nice, but swamped; we were seated about 30 minutes late. attempted to get a drink at the bar while we were waiting and were ignored. the host intervened and got the bartender&#39;s attention, and even then we still had to wait.. oh well.<br><br>the service was totally abysmal, though our server was very nice. waited over 20 minutes to place our order for dinner, and my order arrived incorrect despite being clear with our server. waited another 30 minutes for a round of drinks which came out AFTER our food.. after we had asked 3 different people what the status of our drinks was since our server was MIA. the food itself was fine, but the place was so dark i could barely see what i was eating. and then once we finished dinner ANOTHER repeat round of drinks came out which we thankfully got comped because it was a miscommunication.<br><br>and the icing on the cake.. once we got home, i was sick all night and well into saturday with food poisoning. great date night! needless to say, we will never go to this place again.<br><br>i&#39;d give it 0 stars if i could, but the hosts were doing the best they could with the tables, and the head waiter was very courteous and got things done. the view is very nice but the table we had was practically in the pool. i&#39;d like my money back, please.	0
How do you rate or review an experience like this? It almost seems sacrilege to criticize someone who has invited you into their literal home for dinner. But I&#39;ll give this review my best shot. I usually hate esoteric food reviews, but I&#39;ll probably end up drifting that way anyway.<br><br>Craig and company really care about what they do. This isn&#39;t just some grind or cash-grab they&#39;re doing. He&#39;s described Wolvesmouth as wanting to put together a band and it seems that&#39;s exactly what he&#39;s done. They harmonize and make a great experience together. I&#39;ve never been so close to the action. They invite you to walk around while they work, look at what they&#39;re doing, get as close as you want without being an obstruction. It isn&#39;t so much of a dining experience as it is an education into what goes into a three-star quality meal.<br><br>I had a 6:30PM seating and we were treated to nine courses. The long dining table accommodated about 20 people. I got to know some really interesting guests and share conversation with them. It seemed as soon as our meal started, it was nearly over. Where did the time go? Trust me, you will ask yourself this same question. Three hours flew by and we were treated to some gorgeous and delicious platings.<br><br>I&#39;m not much of a sweet or dessert person, but the dessert courses were among my favorite. The cookie/biscuits they created and integrated with my peanut-butter and toasted marshmallow panna cotta were phenomenal. The way they coax a soft, but firm crunch out of the cookie without being overly moist or dry. It&#39;s airy, but dense. It&#39;s toothy, but not abrasive. It really is one of the top dishes I&#39;ve had in my life.<br><br>It doesn&#39;t make sense for me to give a play-by-play for all these courses we were served. They were diverse. They had range. They didn&#39;t necessarily follow any pattern I could detect, but that is not a criticism. They were all incredible and packed full of innovation.<br><br>The people were great. I wish I had more time to get to know them better, or exchanged contact information. The food was satiating and amazing. The earthquake was slightly jolting but unifying. The decor was one of a kind and intimate. <br><br>Strongly considering buying myself an early June birthday present in the form of a ticket to their Cut Your Teeth collaboration with Matthew Bone. I have full trust in Craig and his team and would love another opportunity to get to know them, their passions, and meet other types of company they keep. A truly unique dining experience.	1
Good looking place, with decent apps - but the service was awful.  The waitress literally walked away mid-drink order, twice.  My date and I had to focus on what we were going to say before she came back, because she was on a comet-like cycle.  Seemed like years.  And when we did get her attention we needed to get it ALL in, or else we would have to wait for another trip around the sun.  Very nerve wracking.  Looking around at the other waitresses I figured it out - they were all busing as well as waitressing.  Clearing plates, wiping tables, setting tables.  Plus the waitressing.  They couldn't keep up; something had to give.  Having said that, I've never had someone walk away mid-order like that before - much less do it twice.	0
The food is really good here. Been a couple times. Each time I come, I have a different experience, but overall, I'd have to give it 4 out of 5 stars. Their food is good, but not always consistent, so I can't really push for that 5th star. Nevertheless, worth coming here to catch up with a friend, or a casual lunch with someone.	1
I&#39;m in love with this spot! <br>It was simply by chance that we came in. Needed to get away from the blistering cold and it happened to be close to the L train. <br>We ordered the Shrimp-Po Boy Sandwich, Kale salad &amp; plenty of yummy beer. <br><br>The food was scrumptious. <br>The service was friendly, fast and enjoyable. <br>Our server was such a cool guy. <br>The decor had a WOW factor. The art work, light fixtures, booths, cute random gnome, was interesting and conversation worthy. You can tell a lot of thought went into <br>each and every detail. Loved it! <br><br>I think I&#39;m coming back again for brunch tomorrow. :-)	1
We have ordered several times from this place.... its good and reasonably priced. Yummy boba and the sandwich combos are ideal for lunch.	1
I am a huge fan of this place! Their portions are huge and prices are reasonable. Their kimchi jjigae is my favorite. There is tons of meat in the jjigae (best part, in my opinion)!<br><br>Their juns (Korean pancake?) are also large and cheap! <br><br>Also tried their LA galbi (short ribs). They were good, but I would stick with their jjigae and juns for the most part. I have yet to try to boodae jjigae but it looks great.<br><br>Only reason I give it 4 stars is because I wish they had more servers! The place is getting more popular than when it first opened. Today was like fourth time there, and it was the busiest I&#39;ve seen them. With only two servers running the place, it was hard to get their attention and service wasn&#39;t too great.. <br><br>In any case, would still recommend!	1
The gumbo had no flavor and the Cajun fries were undercooked.	0
Solid.I wasn't extremely impressed with their drinks (I tried the mango mojito...eh), but the fun atmosphere, friendly service and good food made up for it. The homemade s'more dessert is such a great idea, and they were delicious and messy just like s'mores should be!	1
Great service from Jonathan ! The grill chicken cartilage , beef tataki , bacon wrap mushroom , gizzard , are just a few great appetizer ! I Definitely <br>will come back with good friends for great food !	1
The coffee is distinctly different from most other places which can either be a plus or a minus depending on your coffee pallette. I personally don't care for the flavor but I could see others enjoying it.	0
I went here to meet some buddies on a Sunday evening. We went here due to all the good yelp reviews and overall, we weren't disappointed. We got there around 7:30pm and sat in the outside part of the bar. The bar itself is pretty large with a large indoor section and an outdoor section with heat lamps. It was cold outside but the heat lamps worked well and sitting outside was worth it. Although it was Sunday, they still offered us the happy hour prices which was really cheap. Their happy hour food options were really cheap as well. However, I'm lowering it one star only because the food wasn't especially great, but I can't say it was horrible for bar food either. Overall, the service was good and the vibe was also nice. A really mixed crowd with some young and older folks. If I lived in the area, I would definitely go here more regularly. I will definitely head back if we're looking for a place to hangout in the area.	1
I went here once before and loved it. It was the best meal I&#39;ve ever had in New York <a href="/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FCity.so&amp;s=5afffd5227ded5ed072ece0de8b60ac77761a6e159abfd34ed58e0b165c4d945" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">City.so</a> I bought my friends from Perth here in their four day stay in nyc. <br><br>We came on their first night, and unfortunately for all of us, three hours after the meal we were violently ill. It took two full days to recover, and I called to let them know because I think it is such a fantastic restaurant. However no one bothered to call me back. I really wanted them to because I desperately want to like this place again.<br><br>I hope it was a one off and never happens again as my first experience was brilliant.	0
Surprisingly small venue but a nice enough place for a sunday brunch. Imagine a nighttime view would be nice with lights but daytime was pretty much meh.<br>Service was smooth and friendly, we enjoyed eggs and biscuits that were tasty. The carafe of mimosas won us over though.<br>While reservations are recommended we didn&#39;t find it too busy at 11am on Sunday. Oh and it&#39;s a bit of a hunt to actually arrive at the rooftop; I know you&#39;d think that would be the easy part. :)	1
I've found myself at Doughroom quite a few times when visiting a friend in Palms. I love the food, the beer list (both draft and bottled) is pretty solid, and the ambience reminds me of many places I love in Brooklyn. It's a great neighborhood joint and is the perfect little date spot.I've had a few of their pizzas - Bianco and Flying Pig were both pretty great. I had the pappardelle with bolognese on my last visit and that was super delicious. I hear the calzones are to die for and I've heard great things about the garlic knots. Definitely a well balanced menu executed right.I think I'm always up for a visit because of their rotating craft beer list. I just had the Drake flight, which was a variety of five beers for $16. A bit pricey for a flight, but it did not disappoint :)It seems like they are trying extra hard to boost the service too, so kudos to them! The manager (or owner?) was extremely attentive on my visit last night. I already know I will be back!	1

In attempt to make up for leaving his dirty socks everywhere (I finally reached my limit) my husband and I had lunch at Gramercy Tavern today. <br><br>Just as I do not understand why my husband can&#39;t put his socks away, I do not get the hype about Gramercy Tavern. In any case, my husband now has two things to make up for: leaving his socks everywhere and taking me for a sub-par lunch for leaving his socks everywhere.<br><br>Ambiance: Let&#39;s start with the good. This place is beautiful! The decor is really just stunning, kind of like Tavern in Brentwood, CA (maybe the same owners?) but less packed. Open, airy, spacious. <br><br>Service: Can&#39;t complain. Servers were on it at all times.<br><br>Food: Mostly terrible.<br><br>*Warm Lobster Salad - The lobster was very chewy and the portion was tiny for $18. I was utterly underwhelmed with the lack of salt and flavor.<br><br>*Cauliflower Soup - Not my thing at all. The soup had a strange bitter taste. My husband seemed okay with it. Or maybe he was too scared to say anything?<br><br>* Smoked Arctic Char - This entree was almost not edible. The smoked flavor was just too much...it tasted like smoked salmon (which I love) but magnified 10 times. It was just wrong.<br><br>* Halibut - Finally something tasty! My husband ordered this as his main and it was nearly perfect. I loved the tomato water and the potatoes. The eggplant was a bit greasy but I&#39;m splitting hairs here.<br><br>So maybe my palate isn&#39;t elevated enough or something but seriously, I wished I was at Chipotle during the entire lunch, where I could have had 5 burrito bowls for the price of my chewy lobster and too-smoky char.<br><br>Obviously I&#39;m the only one on Yelp who feels this way but I (and my husband) have no plans to return to Gramercy Tavern.	0
It was our daughter's 21st birthday and she selected the restaurant as one of her favorites.  Our table chef was very entertaining, with swift knife skills and amusing routines.  We had the basic chicken teriyaki with various additional proteins, eg, i had scallops, husband had beef and shrimp.  All was delicious and plentiful!	1
Try the resturant week menu, the food is good. Love the cheese cake, short rib and pasta.Chicken is ok nothing special.	1
Cute place right in the heart of LACMA.<br>Service was good, but food/dessert was overpriced and HORRIBLE! Really, I literally wanted to stop at one bite... <br>If I ever go back, I will just have to get their drinks!	0
People here are extremely nice, which is the reason why I upped this an extra star. Poke here though is a bit mediocre. I do have a quick little theory though about the fact that this place wasn&#39;t as good as the other Poke I&#39;ve been too here in Vegas, well the thing is, we came in here about 10 minutes before this place was about to close. But if you own a poke spot you&#39;re expected to have fresh fish all the way up to when you close, so I can&#39;t really use that too much of an excuse. Just like I said this place is great though, people that run this tiny poke spot are really really courteous, nice, and everything else that goes along those lines of words.<br><br>We ordered the usual stuff just more of it because we just came here right before we left back home to the bay. We came here to bring a bunch of poke because we don&#39;t have anything like that around the bay. Anyways we had the squid, ahi garlic, and pretty much all the other ahi flavors. I might come back here and give this place another shot just because how awesome the owners are here and my theory about coming to this place late might be right.<br><br>Owners keep up the friendly service. Service really matters when coming to any place!	1
Finally! A great sushi restaurant in LIC. look no further. They are best in class and take great care in bringing high quality product to the customer. Thank you for coming to LIC.	1
I&#39;ve been to downtown several times but never thought of eating around the area until now. It seems like the only area to eat around here are the street hot dog carts and the McDonalds until my friend pointed out a sign that said food court. Being that it&#39;s Good Friday and we can&#39;t eat meat we thought we&#39;d try to see if they had something to offer that didn&#39;t contain meat. The guy at the counter offered a vegetarian burger. <br><br>The burger contained a fried potato patty with lettuce, tomato, cheese, and grilled onion. It came with a side of French fries with basil sprinkled on it. The best part that really gave it a kick was their basil garlic sauce. Whenever I&#39;m in the area I&#39;ll def come back to eat here again but on a day where I can eat meat.<br><br>Also my friend ordered a strawberry banana with whip cream. She had me try it and it was good.	1
I went there for brunch at the service was TERRIBLE. The food was ok. I would describe at best as a glorified Squat and Gobble. There was a line but empty tables. We waited over 15 minutes for our drinks and where never asked again if we wanted another one. I had heard so many great things about this place. And while I would like to give it a 2nd chance I can no longer tolerate bad service in this city. There are too many gems to hang out in the rough	0
The best Indian food I've had. Service was excellent. This is our new go-to place. EDIT Went back a second time and had the buffet and I advise against it. Only a couple of items and it wasn't replenished while we were there.	1
We love coming here when we prefer more specialised items than the unimaginative platter of American-style carbs for breakfast/brunch. Of course you&#39;ll be paying a little more than boring diner prices but it&#39;s worth every penny! Their food is cooked hot off the stove and nothing tastes like it was a day old or has been reheated from a frozen pack.<br><br>Because I dislike greasy sausage and eating eggs in the morning, I was happy that I could order a much healthier lean chicken paillard at 9am and not get strange looks at Theresa&#39;s. Yep, I&#39;m one of those people who likes to order the offbeat things that don&#39;t go with the normal flow of the schedule or house specialty. The chicken paillard of course was delicious and admittedly, quite a lot of food for the price. Tea is not complimentary since they serve better name brand tea flavours besides Lipton but that&#39;s fine with me.<br><br>Everyone comes here like they know each other but that shouldn&#39;t be a deterant for newcomers--the waitstaff still treats you with the same warmness and attentative service they do with the regulars who are also superfriendly themselves. The place attracts a lot of couples which makes for a good spot for romantic breakfasts or brunches. It&#39;s quite amusing how popular this place is with the gorgeous neighbourhood, which also is a visual treat in itself for a scenic stroll.	1
Their main dishes (esp Jun-Bok-Jook) are all really good. Also they only give you 3 or 4 ban-chans but they are all sooooo good, esp jang-jo-rim :)They only have few tables so you may have to wait.	1
Great place. Really good food all around. Best mexican place in this neighborhood so far. I wish they closed a bit later.	1
I probably come here 2 times a month. I come here when I want a sure thing, or a place to drink with friends (byob). Service is usually really good, food is always great, minus the tamales.	1
I would actually give them 2.5 stars, but rounded up...From the moment we walked in without reservations, we never once felt particularly welcome. After much sighing and carrying on by the hostess- and eventually the manager- we were told they would 'squeeze us in.' We're talking 5p because we had a toddler in tow and only one other table had patrons...Anyway, we loved the idea of ordering various small plates. Not one single dish was amazing. The mixed greens salad and the flat iron steak were both very good. The saffron chicken and the fiery prawns were good, but nothing special. Same for the Alki pizza- the crust is very good, but the toppings are just meh. The biggest issue we had with the food is that it came out in stages, with two of the items arriving after we'd completely finished the rest of the meal. No apologies or anything. It's obvious that the place is understaffed (just the manager and 2 waitresses- all of whom are spending ample time socializing). Everything is overpriced, even by Seattle standards. $3-4 for a soda from a can?! The menu states that most diners order 3-4 small plates, but at a minimum of $9 a pop, that's just absurd. The charcuterie small plate, for example, is $16! When we asked the waitress if they offered a half portion, she said, 'oh, it's already really small...' Again, some of our food items were pretty good, but won't likely return...	0
This place is ridiculously priced. I'm from San Diego, so I know good Mexican food, and didn't expect much from this place but this was even worse than I expected. I got a crane Asada quesadilla and it 1) cost ten bucks and 2) was tiny! I can get a way bigger and way yummier one for less than half the price back in SD. And even if sd is closer to the border, this food here just sucks and is way overpriced for the little amount you get. One good this is the hot sauce that came with it and the chips. Weird to dip chips in because it's not exactly salsa, but the flavor was good!	0
My go-to spot. Food, booze &amp; service are great. Feels like home. Outdoor seating. Go.	1
Terrible service. People that got seated after us and ordered after were served first. We waited for a long time for our food. The appetizer we ordered was amazing. It was cheese and bread basically. Then we got to the pizza. It was the most bitter thing I&#39;ve had in a very long time. It made me cringe, I would not go to this place again. The only thing that I loved was the interior design.	0
Went to lunch with some other mail carriers Saturday to try this new place out. The five of us each ordered something different. I got a steak sandwich. My other coworkers got a grilled cheese (which I tried and was very flavorful), chicken panini, pastrami panini, and I can&#39;t remember what that other sandwich was! There was not a single complaint! Everyone enjoyed their meal and the owner took care of us, which we were all greatly appreciative of! I brought a couple menus back home with me to tell everyone about Great American Food. Can&#39;t wait to try something else there next time!	1
after reading several reviews, I was looking forward to dining at BLT. upon promptly arriving for our 7:00 PM reservation we were greeted by the hostesses and had about 10 minute wait for our table (no too bad for Christmas night). while being seated, I noticed we were pretty close to the neighboring tables, a bit uncomfortable to have a romantic dinner, but okay. our server for the night was Juan (could have been Jose) and he was pleasant. I being a meat eater ordered a bone-in NY Steak and my wife being a seafood lover, but wanting to try their meats, ordered their bone-in Rib Eye. we both ordered our steaks Medium. for our sides (all entree' are ala carte) we ordered the &quot;Fingerling Potatoes&quot; and an order of their creamy spinach. we were given a &quot;compliments from the chef&quot; toasted baguettes with a duck liver pate/glace which was delicious. after quite a while (maybe 45 minutes) our main dishes arrived and needless to say we were very disappointed. first off, my steak arrived well done (no pink) and dry, and also without a bone. I don't know if it's their way of serving the NY steak, but mine was also &quot;chopped&quot; into 5 chunks and like I mentioned, it didn't have a bone. going on to my wife's meal, the rib-eye did come with a bone and her's came med-well (very little pink) just to mention; both steaks did come with white plastic &quot;Medium&quot; cow shaped picks. my Bearnaise dipping sauce (for an up charge) was good, but my wife's &quot;Peppercorn sauce&quot; was bland. as for the &quot;fingerling potatoes&quot; they were basically over cooked fried baked potato wedges with some kind of sauce drizzled on top. the only items we enjoyed were the spinach and the complimentary Pop overs. in my opinion for the price, I would skip BLT and go to Ruth Chris or Morton's... stay away!	0
Trendy, ridiculously crowded, service is a little uneven, and kind of pricey. Ridiculously crowded needs to be emphasized, as there&#39;s ALWAYS a line for a table.<br><br>It redeems itself, though-- the food is quite good (The Oscar, the Protein, two create-your-own-omelets, and something else were all quite good) although the bread is rather ordinary, and the people watching is excellent if you&#39;re too young for the crowd at Urth Cafe or some other spots.<br><br>Not to mention the outside seating, well, we were seated right by the entrance, so we had seriously good people watching position. It&#39;s not somewhere I would go regularly, but on a beautiful morning like this morning to a place I only rarely frequent, it was worth a visit.	1
I had really really high expectations because i loveee korean fried chicken and this place did not disappoint. Ordered the bool dak with cheese (obvs) but because i have a kind of weird stomach i went with level 1. It wasn't really spicy and i wish i went for level 2, but it makes me wonder how the levels can jump so much??? Also ordered the chicken wings and man oh man. So good!!!! They were so crispy and juicy (also extremely hot) and delicious... Definitely felt a little overpriced. This place definitely goes better with beer and than any other types of alcohol imo. Only downside was that they were put of hoegaarden :(	1
We had a very frustrating experience tonight and will never visit again.  To be fair to the establishment, we had been told that we could bring a bottle of wine and it turns out that that is against their policy.  So, no big deal, right?  Hell, no.	0
Great place. Great food. Good pricing. Very nice staff. We are more than happy to come back. Great veggie options. Nice salads. Silent lounge music. And they have Gibli movies on three big screens. What more could u ask for?	1
Cute cafe! I love their display of pastries and to-go meals. Their yogurt parfaits are definitely one of my faves. I wish they were closer for my morning coffee runs. <br><br>I will definitely be back for more :)	1
This place is excellent. The atmosphere is welcoming and the staff are very personable. The steak frites is always great and there is a very nice selection of french wines by the glass. It is refreshing to see a small by-the-glass wine list that is not dominated by blunt dumb new world wines- very sophisticated and on point. In addition to the addictive Eggs McBlackCat, Sunday brunch features an excellent psyhe-folk-krautrock DJ set by the one and only Greh Holger (of Vacation Records fame)	1
I had a great maiden voyage with Canter's. I went to Langer's a couple years ago when I heard about the great Jewish deli tradition in LA and was pleased, so I decided to make it a point to try the equally important historical delis in the area.The decor and vibe is as cool as it gets. Old school NY deli vibe, but with a diner flare that only the west coast can provide (since we have more physical space). It's important to note that this old school vibe is not tacky, nor is it like walking into a dusty mausoleum. The place is not old, rather, it is classic, meaning they have faithfully preserved the fundamental character of the place, while still maintaining a modern restaurant.Food: The pickles are spot on. Crisp with just the right amount of spice. I had the Brooklyn ave. w/ corned beef and potato salad, while my guest had a pastrami Reuben w/ fries. My sandwich hit all the right notes---corned beef, slaw, Russian dressing, Jewish rye. I had a couple bites of the Reuben and was equally as pleased. The potato salad has an interesting sweet side to it that contrasts really well with the smoke of the meat and bite of the dressing and pickles. The only thing I am sad about, is not being able to take advantage of the bakery. There are some amazing looking things in that cabinet.	1
Lucky enough to attend a Yelp event here last evening and had an opportunity to sample some of the best items here: <br><br>Kegged cocktails - I had the Dark &amp; Stormy and Gin Fizz. Both were strong &amp; tasty. <br><br>Burger - Incredible. They use grass-fed beef and it was obviously fresh and quite juicy. I was wow&#39;ed by this one. Try this. <br><br>Wings, wonton, risotto ball appetizers - all worthy of ordering<br><br>The service was great all night, and everyone I encountered was professional. Really hoping this place does well going forward.	1
Brio has two locations in  Las Vegas. We have eaten at both, but this review pertains to Tivoli Village location. The ambiance is very lively and people are eating outdoors, indoor at tables and in the bar area. The tempo is upbeat and the noise level is contagious. The food was very good and one out-of-town guest praised it several times during dinner and later in an email. Our service was very good from most everyone, but our server was having a slightly off night... her focus seemed somewhere else but it was still good and not troublesome. Prices are reasonable... $70 for two including two glasses of wine, cappuccino, tax and tip.We enjoy Brio and other off-Strip restaurants in Las Vegas and frequent them more than the overpriced casino/hotel restaurants.Brio at Town Square and Tivoli Village are with the visit and recommended.	1
Wow on so many levels. Came in end of the night on a Thursday. Two cool dudes were working and took car of me and a friend. Very nice and helpful and gave us some SAKI to go with our late night snack. They made us a order of the pan seared and steamed dumplings and they were delicious. Had a unique green chili oil dipping sauce that paired nicely with the sweet flavorful ponzu dipping sauce. Great food even better service.	1
I was very lucky to find this place. Amazing subs and great salads. The Rotisserie chicken and the Roasted Turkey is excellent, both are cooked in house, so pretty much guaranteed fresh. I went three times in the first week of them opening. The salads aren&#39;t as good as the sandwiches but definitely still great. It wasn&#39;t expensive and was very clean. Definitely a staple for anyone living in the area! Excellent franchise with a lot of potential. <br><br>The employees who were working were also extremely helpful and willing to answer any questions I had! Overall excellent experience every time I have gone.	1
My dad use to bring us food from Thai Deli when I was in high school (long ago), always the #1 with double macaroni salad. I went recently and it still taste so good!	1
The first thing I spied when walking in was a predator. A baby one. Like in the movie only wrought from metal sitting on an end table by the door. The second thing that caught my eye was the shuffleboard table. I felt so much at home that I was trying to figure out where to put my bed. And I hadn\u2019t even made it to a table or looked at the menu yet.	1
I don&#39;t know about this place. I went once and I think I thought it was good, but went back again and maybe I just outgrew it. The banana cream pie is the best part. The fries with ketchup were good. The burger though was just blah, the sauce wasn&#39;t anything special and the meat wasn&#39;t either.	0
Great place! Food was wonderful, service was top notch!	0
The reviewer who wrote that &#34;Lazeez and its literally home-cooked meals are absolutely the best I have had, not just in Miami&#34; really needs to get out more. Either that, or things have dramatically changed at Lazeez in the 18 months since then.<br><br>I tried their meat samosas, lamb korma, and chicken tikka with naan on a recent visit. The samosas and the naan weren&#39;t bad, and they were the best part of the meal (note that the samosas are very small, only about a quarter the size of the typical samosa you would be served at most places). The other dishes were just fair, certainly not worth a drive across town.<br><br>The prices were a lot lower than what you would find at most South Asian restaurants in South Florida, but I&#39;d much rather pay higher prices and get some food that tastes good.<br><br>The man who took my order and later brought out my food seemed very brusque when he brought out the order, but it&#39;s hard to know what to make of that after only one visit to the restaurant.<br><br>One plus is that there is a Pakistani grocery store just a few steps away.	0
I've been eating and drinking at Glass Nickel for many years. The waitstaff is wonderful, the food is delicious and the drinks are strong. These days we order delivery about once a week and are never disappointed. Our order is always received in a much faster time than we expect!	0
My husband and I had a really good experience at Crush. We ordered the date &amp; artichoke pizza and a kale/mushroom salad for starters. The pizza was different and tasty (I can&#39;t remember ever seeing a date on a pizza before) and my husband, who is vegetarian, could not get enough of the salad. Also my husband was SO EXCITED because they carried Innis &amp; Gunn beer and he hadn&#39;t seen it in the States before. I had a glass of Chard. I thought it was pretty terrible but I&#39;m not one to complain about wines so I sipped it twice before my husband asked me if I liked it. I told him I didn&#39;t so he tried it. He thought it had gone bad so he asked the waitress to replace it with a different one. She was very kind about it and the new glass was quite nice. For entree I had the shrimp risotto and my husband had the roasted cauliflower. Both were great. We ended the meal with an odd sort of chocolate dessert with mangoes. It wasn&#39;t my favorite dessert ever but small enough that we still managed to finish it off easily. The waitress was great and attentive. It had a very European feel inside. You quickly forget that you are just inside a casino!	1
Interesting menu and were able to accommodate my gluten allergy with no problem.  Service was very good and waitress seemed to have many tables to cover.  Salmon was very good as were the grilled brussel sprouts and nice fresh salad.  Only real complaint was the valet parking service was very poor.  Waited out front in the area marked for valet for almost 00 minutes without a valet attendant ever coming out so we had to drive around and find street parking.	0
Terrible terrible attitude the lady over the phone sounded annoyed whenever I would ask her a question Mind you I ordered over the phone . Also took an hour to get delivered and I&#39;m less then a mile away . What is going on ?!	0
Yesterday was my second time trying this place. The first time I remember the food being SO great! Yesterday however I did not have the same experience. I feel like this place was too busy for its own good. The waiter who served us was a really attractive, kind guy, but.. He had so many tables spread out that we only saw him about three times. I ordered some french toast coffee cake style and a side of breakfast potatoes. When they arrived the potatoes were really over cooked (half of them so hard I couldn&#39;t eat them. My french toast was NOT the one I ordered. It took me about 5 minutes to get the waiters attention, he recognized the order was incorrect and then returns about 1 minute later WITH THE SAME FRENCH TOAST the only difference was at this point they threw on top the mix for the coffee cake french toast. :-( so with all the time those particular toast sat out they were cold. I was so disappointed with my meal. Even the french toast wasn&#39;t cooked all the way through. By cutting into it I found that only the top and bottom had a slight egg batter over them. The middle was regular uncooked bread. UGH! I don&#39;t think I would go back to them again.	0
great food and setting and staff. nice mix of drinks	1
I&#39;m not sure how this place got a 4star rating all around. Like other reviews here, i came because of rating but not worth it. To be honest, i like the ambiance here but not the food. Salsa tasted like some chili pepper, water and manufactured sauce taste. In other words MSG added sauces. Burrito had small portion of meat. Tostada salad bowl was greasy because they didnt fry at proper temperature. Tortilla bowl ate up all the oil from the fryer. It was greasy salad. Carne asada fries were okay. It was same salsa they had. I expected something better. I had to finish everything because i was starving. One funny thing was that the server came out with a pen and asked me if i left a pen at their restaurant. I dont think i eat with a pen and theres no reason why i shouldve used one. And after i told him it wasnt mine he said the owner asked me to write a review on yelp about my experience. So here you go. From what i saw, the owner left before my table left. I wouldnt recommend here to any of my friends.	0
I went here for brunch on a Saturday and it was pretty empty around 11:30am, but overall I really liked the place. The portions were enormous; I had some sort of pancake breakfast with eggs, toast, bacon, and potatoes- all very good. My wife had the fish tacos which she enjoyed. An added touch was that they brought out a bowl of cereal as an appetizer, too funny.	1
&#34;GOODBYE SEX. HELLO BURGERS AND FRIES FROM THE APPLE PAN!!&#34; <br><br>I heard some freak announce that upon exiting this fine dining establishment not too long ago.<br><br>Hmm...perhaps it was me...<br><br>One of the guys who works here kinda looks like Charles Bukowski, and I&#39;m sure if good &#39;ol Hank were still around, he&#39;d hit up this joint for sure.	1
Dishes tried (partly from Restaurant Week Menu + standard menu)	1
*This review is not about the food, but rather the service*<br><br>Though Barboncino doesn&#39;t take reservations, I called yesterday to ensure that they could accommodate our party, as one of my girlfriends recently broke her hip. The host I spoke to was incredibly accommodating -- ensuring me that the dinner staff would be made aware of our situation and to call 30 minutes before arrival to ensure we were seated immediately.<br><br>However, when we called the restaurant that evening, the dinner hostess could not have been ruder. She was unwilling to accommodate our party, and refused to acknowledge the conversation I had with the brunch host.<br><br>Needless to say, we were completely put off by the service and will not be returning.	0
Chose this restaurant based on the recommendation of a friend. The food was excellent, but the service left much to be desired. After our food was served our waiter never checked back in at the table so by the time I had a chance to tell him that I had not received a part of my dinner it was too late. We also had to make some simple requests multiple times.I found it strange that the amuse bouche at a seafood restaurant contained beef... I think that would be more appropriate at a steakhouse. Since I don't eat beef, I have no ideas whether it was good or not :)That said, entrees, soup and appetizer were all amazing! If they improved their service, this would be an amazing place for dinner.	1
I wanted to like this place, but was fairly disappointed.We ordered for delivery and were told on the phone that it would take about an hour, which is fine. But the food showed up after 90 minutes, not an hour. When I called the restaurant to inquire about the status of our order, I was treated politely but offered no apology for the lateness.The driver wasn't carrying any change when he got to the door, and since he (for some odd reason) didn't park in front of our building, I had to wait while he ran down the block to his car to get change. He also offered no apology for the long wait.The food was just so-so. One member of our group ordered the pork rice plate and two of us ordered vegetarian dishes. Nothing was bad, just rather humdrum and unimaginative.	0
HOT! HOT! HOT! HOT and very great Chinese food!<br>I order the &#39;fish head&#39; or something, it was DELICIOUS but HOT! Home style of meat is the best &#39;smoked meat&#39; or looked like &#39;bacon&#39; but not real &#39;bacon&#39; I ever had. Steam egg also is the one I highly recommend. <br><br>The location is kinda hard to find out, cross street Chinatown and behind or next Korean Queen yogurt (sorry! my friend take me there).	1
Toast, is a mediocre place, with a high tagged reputation. It&#39;s a few notches about Denny&#39;s, and a few notches below Dough Boys (who is currently getting rid of termite infestation).<br><br>The only thing I like about this place, is the smoked salmon platter, and the salade nicoise (although a heap of canned tuna in the middle of this salad, is a bit ridiculous (why not fresh tuna?). Oh yes, they have stevia available too, for my iced tea (even if the last time I went, the waitress didn&#39;t even know what it was). <br><br>The service is actually pretty decent, and I&#39;ve only eaten on the sidewalk. I actually have no idea what the interior looks like. I definitely don&#39;t go for the crowd. I could care less who frequents an establishment. <br><br>The food comes out relatively quick, but it&#39;s nothing spectacular. Everything they have here, can be found better elsewhere. I guess the only reason I go, is because of the smoked salmon. I really love bagels, capers, cream cheese, and smoked salmon. Otherwise, I&#39;d never actually go back. I&#39;m sure their overhead $$$ is ridiculous, so their prices reflect that. Also, parking is pretty much a hit or miss. You either get a spot, or you don&#39;t. The valet here is inconsistent, and street parking here is rare. Don&#39;t even PONDER parking in the neighborhoods. You WILL get a ticket. Just be observative of the posted street signs.	0
TINY place, limited parking. The dining area is basically the kitchen<br><br>but that doesn&#39;t even matter because after that first bite, all else fades into black.<br><br>This place really has some of the best tasting Korean comfort foods around. If you&#39;re debating whether to get chicken soup (sam-gae-tang) or abalone porridge (junbok-jook) GET BOTH!!!!!!!!!!!	1
Based on the food alone I would not say this restaurant is great! It is good certainly but for the price you pay I would expect better.<br><br>The service was not what I would have expected but the restaurant itself is appealing.<br><br>I went there twice with groups for my office and each time we were underwhelmed.<br><br>We got the pizza(spinach) it was nice but dry <br>The crab toast which was expensive for what it was <br>Mashed potatoes were good but general feeling was that we had better.<br>I did get a pasta special which I enjoyed though so overall that did save the meal.<br><br>Long story short- between the staff and the food it was not worth $140 a head.	0
Side dishes are almost non existent!!! Kimchi and duk bok Ki!!! No salad instead only onions!!! My group was told we wouldn't be able to order unless all the meat was consumed beforehand ... 2hr time limit ??? WTH ?!	0
Great food and a really nice place. I tried a steak with mushrooms and potatoes and I liked it a lot :) Will try something else one of these days :)<br>Also, hookah is pretty affordable and if you are there, try their home flavour.<br><br>You&#39;ll see me again very soon! :)	1
Great pizza amongst the multitude of pizza places Johnnys the best! Margarita extra basil add pepperoni well done yummy good job guys!	1
We were so glad to see a sushi restaurant in downtown Las Vegas. The atmosphere was very pleasing. However, the service did not match. It took us about 15 minutes to receive our first dish (a few pieces of nigiri sushi). After receiving many dishes, such as the yellowtail yuzu ceviche and screaming orgasm, we thought to ourselves &#34;what was our favorite dish?&#34; and we couldn&#39;t think of it. This place has potential, but the server did not know much about the product she was selling. This place needs some help if it is going to survive. Le Thai will definitely be funding this to stay open for the next year (since it apparently is the same owners).	0
The service is poor. Waiting more that 15 min only to order something to drink. I can&#39;t say anything about the food because I leave the restaurant before order something. Pretty bad, because the menu looks delicious	0
This is a no fuss place. It&#39;s a hidden gem of a place. It&#39;s a counter nestled in the rear of a market. If you&#39;re looking for a high end frill filled place; go somewhere else. If you&#39;re looking to have a good sandwich and a laid back experience come on by, but don&#39;t tell all your friends just the cool ones.<br>Erica makes top notch sandwiches!<br>Personally I didn&#39;t like the fries but the potato salad made up for that and that nah have been top 3 chicken sandwiches I&#39;d ever had.	1
Entrees so devine<br>Your patio is Paris<br>Models everywhere	1
We went here on Valentine's Day and we had a great time.  The atmosphere was very nice and romantic. On the bar side of the restaraunts they have a lounge area with a fireplace and a television. The food that we ordered was pretty on point and I would definitely recommend trying this place out.  Our waiter wasn't great but all of the other employees made up for him.	0
Mediocre at best. While the service was phenomenal the food really just wasn&#39;t that great, especially for the price. Tough calamari, dried out chicken. There is far better Italian food in NYC so I would advise you keep looking to avoid disappointment.	0
I went in not having much of any expectation and I was pleasantly surprised. Their burger was awesome and we had a great dinner.The prices were affordable. My friend ordered the tuna appetizer and he said it was pretty amazing. I will be back.	1
The first and only time I visited this celebrity bakery, I was waiting for my 2 loaves of bread, a batard, a couple of baguettes and an olive bread. What shocked me as I looked at their display case, is how much people are willing to spend for a small container of calabatta olives. Away from the glitz of the bakery, came the taste test. Having lived in France, I had memories waiting to be rekindled. But alas, memories are not meant to be rekindled. Just not at this place.The crust was as hard as coconut shell. While it is true that the crumb had those irregular large holes, the hallowed signs of a well rested European loaf, the tooth shattering texture of the crust creates an everlasting imprint in the psyche. Could this be Crust Shock?I wondered just how long those loaves had been left around. And to this day, it still manages to keep me awake (sometimes).Later, after eating bread from ACME and Semifreddis, I became and am still convinced that the bread basket of West is definitely the Bay area.	0
I&#39;ve given a two star rating because of my last visit to AR. It seemed like they were purposely sending out the most horrible and cold food they possibly could. Sad part is that I have had a delivery from this place and it was pretty good. I took 3 friends to eat here and I looked like a moron for picking this place. Even the tater tots and soup was cold. How is that possible?	0
In a city full of gourmet burger places, this has been one of my favorite so far. Too many places charge over $10 for a small burger that doesn't even come with fries. I've been here a few times and have almost exclusively ordered the p dub burger with bacon, but it's probably the best burger I've had in Los Angeles. The sriracha mayo is what really sets it off and it comes in at a decent size for about $8 ($9 with bacon). No fries, but I can live with that. There is only outdoor seating, which is kind of annoying. Other than that I would probably rate it 4.5 stars or so.	1
Meh. Describes it completely. My friends adore this place but even with a massive menu... The dish I selected was nothing to rave about. I got the breakfast dish with links and eggs with toast. The service was slow... and my food didn't make it up for that. My links were a little rubbery and eggs ( i got egg whites) were buttery and saturated with fat or something. I tried to eat a little healthy with the eggs but they made it fattening and it didn't taste good. I had 10 times better experience at Dennys. The reason I actually didn't give it one star coz my friends love it and it's not like I will not go here again because frankly they love it here. however, they ran out of matzo ball soup. A jewish deli ran out of the best dish... And this was the second time. And then lo and behold two minutes later we saw another waiter bringing soup to the other table. Our waitress said Oh, I guess we did but shouldn't have anymore. Wow. I mean it's pretty bad for me... but I will give it a second chance. Maybe I ordered the wrong dish.... But avoid the breakfast food!	0
My boyfriend and I needed a nice romantic night out with just the two us since our schedules have been hectic lately. I chose Luna Park because other Yelpers gave high remarks and the menu looked appetizing.<br><br>Needless to say, we weren&#39;t disappointed at all. I made reservations on <a href="/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fopentable.com&amp;s=897c359bd752b4f5407d5ea86453c82be2d1913c8d0b51b18d81fc58f52a6497" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">opentable.com</a> the same day and when we got to the restaurant we were seated within five minutes. At first the hostess was going to place us at a two-seater table, but I asked if we could be placed in a booth and she accomodated our request.<br><br>We started off with the goat cheese fondue with apples and grilled bread. All I can say is yum, yum and yum! It was a nice appetizer portion for us to share without making us full. I would have never thought to pair granny smith apples with goat cheese, but it works!<br>For our entrees, I got the Onglet Steak with Chile Verde Sauce and instead of fries, I got mashed potatoes. My boyfriend ordered the Breaded Pork Cutlet with mashed potatoes. My steak was cooked perfectly, medium-rare and tasted delicious. My boyfriend&#39;s Cutlet was yummy and paired perfectly with the apple-cranberry sauce.<br><br>To drink, I ordered their White Sangria..Very tasty without overpowering with alcohol or sweetness.<br><br>Service was excellent. Food was delicious. Ambience perfect. A very enjoyable dining experience. I would definitely dine here again!<br><br>We finished off our dining experience in L.A. with dessert at Mashti Malones!	1
I was working at a restaurant on North Bay Village and I was looking for a healthy/vegan alternative. After looking at the reviews, I took a trip to the website and I must say it&#39;s amazing!<br><br>All of the menu choices looked delicious! They do have a $30 delivery minimum (which I was happy to oblige, I was desperately hungry). <br><br>I ordered the hummus and pita bread (comes whole wheat), black bean soup, veggie wrap with tofu, and a quinoa veggie salad. The person who answered was very happy and made my order a breeze.<br><br>Everything came in about an hour (rush hour traffic) and it was absolutely lovely. I will be telling everyone about it and definitely ordering from here again.	1
really, really good :)	1
If this place wasn't on the lake/channel it would be out of business.  Crap food, blah service. Avoid. Nice outside deck. That is why it gets a star.	0
As promising as it seemed, this bar was a tremendous disappointment. Upon ordering, another bartender asked what we wanted and we said that we just ordered vodka tonics. When the bartender brought is our drinks, another brought us the same. He accused me of &#34;never ordering a drink before&#34; and literally grabbed my drink from my hand and dumped it. Meanwhile, I was charged AND TIPPED the other bartender. When I asked the other bartender about my drink, he purposefully ignored me. Only when I went to a sever to explain did the situation get better. Never before have I been SO insulted by a business.	0
The patio of this somewhat hidden restaurant directly next to the 99 cent store on sunset is really pretty, and is a nice comfortable place to have a meal.The food is sometimes really good, and sometimes just okay, you usually can't go wrong with the filet mignon with blue cheese sauce and an order of the frites with the roqueforte dipping sauce. decadent and tasty. the pannacotta for dessert is a nice finish.$40-60 per person	1
Went here with my mom today and had half original crispy chicken, half sweet and spicy chicken. The chicken was decent, but fried a little too long. The salad that came along with it had thousand islands dressing on it, which wasnt great, but hey- at least there was salad^^The bathrooms are pretty gross, ad water comes out only if you turn the left handle of the faucet. The service is good, but it took a long time for the chicken to come out. The interior is cozyish. Don't know if I would come again...	1
My husband and I went to Canter's for the 1st and last time last night and we weren't too happy. They didn't have the desserts the menu offered. We settled for something else but dessert wasn't great. The floors were disgusting. Seems like they never cleaned. If it's not clean on the outside don't want to think about how filthy it must be in the inside.	0

5 stars - nightlife3.5 stars - brunch/ lunchI came here 2x in 12 hours! So I'll break up my review into 2 halves.NIGHTLIFE:When I first drove by, I saw a massive line at 10:30pm (or so), and I started freaking out. According to our Korea study abroad reunion plans, we weren't planning on going in until 11:30 or 12ish. Luckily, one of my friends knew the owner/ was a regular patron, so we were able to skip the entire line (with a group of 12, no less!).As this was my first time, I had no idea what to expect. We went up the elevator to a small room, then into another elevator which actually led to perch, and then started taking it all in. It was hard to tell what was exactly going on in the dim lighting, but it seemed like a pretty poppin place. We headed out to the patio area. It was a bit chilly that night (so ladies, def bring a jacket. There's no coat check, but it's worth keeping warm). Drinks are pretty decently priced. Maybe it's cuz I've only been clubbing a lot in DTLA, but I was pleasantly surprised when drinks were like $10 (i.e. 1 Macallan 12, 1 vodka soda with a splash of cranberry, and a beer = $30). This isn't really a dancing spot, more bar/ loungey - lots of people talking and drunkenly making out in the corners haha Regardless pretty cool place. The view is great, venue is classy, a great place to go out!Last call was at 1:40am. This might've been my only point of irritation. Too early.~~~~~BRUNCH/ LUNCH:Luckily, my friend's AirBnB was literally just across the street from Perch, so we eventually got up with a hangover and decided to go to Perch for food (just 2 of us by this point). This was on a Sunday morning/noon.It looks really good in the daylight. Almost everything that was a wall with windows was now open, so there was so much air and natural light flooding into the place. We got pretty lucky and got a seat right away (if you have a bigger party, def get ready to wait). We sat "inside" but it was right next to an open door/window, so it was basically like sitting outside but in the shade! Here's what we ordered:- bloody mary: it's pretty big, didn't ask me how spicy I wanted it, but it was still pretty good (not spicy though)- mon petit cheri: my broken French translates this into "my little friend" and it comes in a little glass bursting with so many flavors. It's really an interesting drink. There's goose cherry noir, creme yvette, ginger, champagne - I don't even know what those first 2 ingredients are. Not sure if I'd recommend unless you want to try something completely random. It gets stronger as you get to the bottom. - perch burger: to be quite honest, this was like a gourmet IN-N-OUT burger in terms of seasoning and dressing but with a fried egg on it. It was a really messy burger but obviously tasted pretty good. Got it cooked medium rare with a side of fries (you can choose salad if you want). The fries are regular (not sure if you can upgrade to the truffle ones). - #13 benedict: your standard eggs benedict (they have other options as well with salmon or crab). These were ok although they were a bit salty for my taste. These came with a side of house potatoes. Overall, while the service was good, the food tasted ok. It wasn't bad but it wasn't really stunning. If anything, you're paying for the ambience and the view, which are awesome.	1
The food here is very good! We have been back three times this week. Mmmm. Get an omelet and a doughnut!	1
Reservations for 1:15 and seated 20 minutes later. Took 45 minutes to get a glass of water and some menus. Overall experience: Shitty service, poor staff communication, and unapologetic. Fuck this place. Waste of time and money. This place needs a staff that compliments the menu. That shit isn't working in harmony.	0
Very nice, clean place. Excellent service and great food. Will be back again with more friends.	1
Terrible. First time eating Cuban food and went over the specials with the server. Asked for one item and received something else that was almost double the price. I didn&#39;t know what I was eating so I didn&#39;t send it back. Also charged me a different price than what&#39;s on the menu for domestic beer. Server would not correct any of the charges until I asked to speak with the manager. First Cuban experience... worst Cuban experience.	0
The best burger I've ever had. The onion rings are also fantastic. Love it here.	1
Another Madison favorite.	1
Plates too tiny and not so many choices <br>Don&#39;t go there if you&#39;re hungry ! Disappointment for us..	0
I came here because of the yelp reviews. <br>I had ordered the burger and pulled pork. <br>The pulled pork had way too much sauce on it. <br>The burger was average but a lot better than the pulled pork.	0
I had dinner with a girlfriend the waiter was so rude! he was pushing us to get alcohol! when I mention I want water...he was very upset....Not going back ever again	0
I love this place for three reasons:<br>It&#39;s totally gluten free which is great for my celiac family members<br>The food is delicious and plentiful <br>The place is a classic intimate east village restaurant. Very classy and zero pretentiousness. <br>The only draw back is that it is BYOB <br><br>Even without the gluten free thing I would recommend it highly.	1
My wife and I just happened to be in the Little Havana area and we searched Yelp for a close restaurant and found our way here. First off we just moved from Los Angeles and we have had years and years worth of good Mexican food. However we have never had El Salvadorian food so we were kind of excited to try it. The place is fairly small and its in a little strip mall so be warned there are only 15 or so parking spots which were all full so we circled the block a couple times to find parking. <br><br>Once seated we were given menus that had tons of dishes to choose from all with pictures which is always a plus. My wife ordered a Carne Asada plate and I ordered the Caldo De Rez and we both really loved our meals. The Carne Asada was served fresh off the grill with steaming rice. The steak was huge and my wife couldn&#39;t finish it and my BIG bowl of Caldo was as good as any I&#39;ve ever had. The beef was perfectly tender and not rubbery as you will get from time to time. Overall our first experience was absolutely perfect.<br><br>Before we left we decided to order some chicken tamale&#39;s to take home since we&#39;ve never had El Salvadorian tamale&#39;s. Now this was the game changer, the next morning we ate the tamale&#39;s and they were just incredible and by far the best we&#39;ve ever had. They were very moist and not all dry and they were just stuffed with chicken and bursting with flavor. They were so good that we went back a few days later and ordered 30 more and took them to a party at the park where they went quick. Having lived in Los Angeles our entire lives we&#39;ve eaten a million tamale&#39;s but these were hands down the best we&#39;ve ever had. <br><br>I might add the place is not expensive at all.	1
I called ahead for a reservation for a friend and I. The person I spoke to on the phone recommended making reservations, and they had openings a few hours out. I made a reservation, left my name and number, and we showed up promptly.<br><br>After checking in, we noticed the host had already crossed our name off. Either someone already checked in or they marked us off, even though we showed up on time. He did try and hide the fact that he screwed up, by highlighting through my name again. He told me the wait would be about 20 minutes. After we showed up on time for our reservations. He didn&#39;t admit a mistake or anything, just told us to have a drink at their bar. We sit down at the bar, no one is behind the bar, so we aren&#39;t offered water or an alcohol menu or anything. At least give us a cup of water if you messed up.<br><br>About 10 minutes later, a loud Asian lady starting screaming at us to follow her and guides us to a table. She then starts yelling at everyone being seated that we need to sit shoulder to shoulder to each other since they are fitting two more people than the table normally holds. This indicated to me that they did give our reservation away to someone else and trying to shoehorn everyone into a cramped space was the last straw.<br><br>Me and my friend got up and told her that she could stop screaming at us, because there would be plenty of space with us gone. We ended up going to Ohjah, which had excellent service, great food, without having to deal with a host screw up and an old Asian lady screaming at us.	0
Food AMAZING ! Service AMAZING ! Good restudent ... The nicest foood .....good service and great setting	1
We came here on Father&#39;s Day for brunch. I left feeling like I picked a great place to take my dad. <br><br>The restaurant has a clean, modern decor inside and the outdoor seating feels like a secluded garden. The views are beautiful. For a city with so much water and scenery, there certainly is a shortage of good restaurants with a great view. <br><br>I can&#39;t speak for dinner, but their brunch was pretty good and they have a $15 bottomless mimosa/bloody mary special. They have an a la carte brunch or a buffet for $27 with a spread of eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes, fruit, pastries, etc. I thought the a la carte items that my mom and dad ordered tasted better than my brunch, but I definitely got more for my money and after a few mimosas, the quality didn&#39;t matter as much. It was good, but it was your basic 3 or 4 star hotel quality breakfast buffet. I was mostly enjoying my morning beverage and the view. <br><br>I&#39;d definitely come back for drinks and appetizers or dessert. This place really seems perfect for that, and would probably be a great date night spot. Service was a bit slow, but very friendly and we weren&#39;t in a rush. <br><br>Look for parking nearby and walk over to the Viceroy. The parking was around $12 and they don&#39;t validate or do a discount if you eat there.	1
This is the best shawarma in Los Angeles - HANDS DOWN! Their quality has gone down recently but its still pretty good!	1
Banzo falafel is good - no - excellent. Really freaking good. I am happy they exist and deliver. The tabouli was weird - like eating a mint plant. But back to the falafel, so good.	0
First time at this location. Super intimate good for dates. Great food- the fried plantains were amazing. Good cocktails.	1
yum yum yum!!! food was great, service was great!!!	1
I just went on my first ever visit to the Diamond Knot Brewery today. Been thinking about going here for a long time and I finally did it. I have had their beer at brewfest and pubs in Seattle. 	1
So it&#39;s Korean and it&#39;s barbecue but this isn&#39;t your usual Korean bbq. Small&#39;s does a bit of a twist on classic american bbq with a Korean flare. This is most evident in the sauces, sides and specials. I personally really appreciated their take on bibimbap. The brisket and pulled pork were solid and I am looking forward to going back to try the cooked to order chicken. Only complaint was the portion sizes for the platters. They could really use to double the meat for the price.	1
The food is great! Really busy, fun atmosphere. Had the Dojo burger with a fried egg, the ginger slaw is great. Only downside is the sewage smell when dining outside on the street as I don't think there is indoor seating.	1
The best part of this meal was the Andes mint on the way out. Was so excited for this place to be great and it was just awful.<br><br>What a beautiful restaurant space. I took a peek in the kitchen and it looked amazing too, with a smoker and everything. Upstairs the gf and I got a table for two and sat down near the corner.<br><br>Cue the fifteen f*cking minutes until someone noticed us, which only happened after I started staring at a group of four servers talking amongst themselves. Our server came over and said there was a section switch or something that explains how we were forgotten. Meanwhile, we&#39;re extremely thirsty and watched the table behind us get seated after us, get waters and put an order in before we are even paid attention to.<br>So - strike one - the service is crap. On to the food!<br><br>Did we order the wrong things? We didn&#39;t go crazy and get frog legs or shrimp beignets...got two sandwiches (the Brisket Dip which according to our server is the best sandwich) and the Lobster RollBoy or whatever it was called. Side of Gumbo Fried Rice. Fried rice was pretty bland, we were hungry enough to eat it all though. Brisket dip was the best of the three, but not enough au jus in a ramekin too small to actually dip the sandwich in it kind of defeated the purpose of having it there in the first place and ruined it for me. The lobster roll was bland as hell and for $18 was a total rip off. In fact, all the food was priced at the same price points as small plate gourmet restaurants like Son of a Gun and the food here is NOT anywhere close to that good. Overpriced, bland food... On to the drinks!<br><br>We each got martinis. They were made well and I enjoyed them. Yay. We got two little daiquiri glasses to bring to the bar downstairs to get a little drink on the way out. Classy. Cute. Very nice. However the bartender downstairs looked all like &#34;UGH how can I be troubled to pour what is basically an icee into a little glass instead of making drinks for customers who are paying for theirs and are actually going to tip me&#34; when I did tip her, just after we had our drinks.<br><br>This place is crap and if it were cheaper - it wouldn&#39;t be such a big deal that it sucks. Definitely avoid, or just come here for drinks. Hope they get better.	0
So many things went wrong that I&#39;ll just begin in chronological order.<br><br>1. Hot water for my chamomile tea was lukewarm. The tagless tea bag was brought to me with someone&#39;s bare hands.<br>2. The tables were sticky, there weren&#39;t enough place settings and I had to ask for food menus (keep in mind, I made a reservation and even arrived early...there was no reason for our table to not be set up properly).<br>3. In the group of 7, only 2 people enjoyed their meals (potato croquettes &amp; chicken n waffles). My order of two eggs (over-easy) with bacon &amp; homefries were terrible. The eggs were cooked over-hard, the bacon was simultaneously raw and charred and the homefries were the color of cardboard. <br>4. The fritatta of the day was so tiny and came with the same weird potatoes. <br>5. We had to ask for butter when 5 people had toast with their meals. They brought us one spindle of butter to share.<br>6. My father-in-law&#39;s chair slipped from beneath him and he fell on the floor (b/c the chairs were wobbly and the floor was dirty). The staff didn&#39;t try to do anything to compensate for this.<br>7. The staff didn&#39;t refill our water glasses.<br><br>This was just the worst place.	0
Dinner at Ugly Kitchen was mediocre.<br><br>Two friends and I came and were squished into a tiny table even though we had a reservation. The table was so tiny that we could hardly fit two entrees on it at the same time.<br><br>The drinks were the best part of the meal - we made it in time for happy hour and their spicy mango drink was yummy.<br><br>But really, the food was so &#34;meh.&#34;<br><br>The dumplings tasted like pizza. The brie/apple bruschetta was more of a dessert than an appetizer. The chicken adobo was extremely salty and the pork belly entree was 3/4ths fat (I know that pork belly has a lot of fat on it but this dish hardly had any meat). I was definitely disappointed. <br><br>Would come back for drinks but not for food.	0
Visited the new location this morning and had the raw oatmeal and coffee. Coffee is from Panther - enough said on that. Oatmeal was creamy with a nutty flavor and just the right amount of spices. It was served with fresh berries and shaved coconut - yum. The location is larger and has a better layout.	1
man I wanted to love this place since its so close to home, but then again it's probably for the best (i would be getting ramen way too often!) a little background on ramen places I love in order of top favorite first: shinsengumi, santouka, robata jinya, daikokuya. My usual order is spicy miso. I will say the broth is a thick buttery and complex so plus on that but was a little on the salty side. The noodles were thick and a bit too chewy for me, the chashu was soft but had this smoky flavor that didnt balance out well with the broth and is in this huge circular shape that to me was overwhelming. didn't finish the chashu. or my bowl.I don't like giving "ok" reviews :( but i felt like it should be done because I was really looking forward to it because of all the great reviews. Also a little bit pricey, itcame out to $11.40. but it is very new and hopefully management takes these reviews in a constructive way i'd like to try this place again in the future.	0
This place definitely has THE freshest ingredients on their pizza that I have ever been to. Although the pizza tastes fresh and the place is not touristy at all, I would not recommend it for families because it seems to be more of a pizza joint for the younger crowd. It is very expensive for personal size pizzas (but one has to account for the quality of the pizzas).	0
Just hellllllll yeah!!!	0
I splurge at 51 Lincoln five or six times a year because it's the perfect splurge - pretty much guaranteed to be a great dining experience in every respect.  This was a Valentine's evening special, in the early stages of a February blizzard, and the ambiance was warm and inviting, the food as spectacular as ever, and the service highly professional without being the least bit stuffy.As long as this restaurant is open, I'll be eating there.	1
Ordered take out and was ready in 15 minutes. I couldn&#39;t wait to taste all the goodness I ordered. I have to say the mac and cheese is a must! I also ordered the dolphin and the miami vice both were amazing and the icing to the cake where the pieces of candy.	1
Terrific ambience makes for a great spot for any occasion. Food is also excellent - warm pretzel bread, shrimp pasta, braised short rib were standouts.Service however is spotty.  While attentive one minute, the next they disappear.  For the last half of our meal not a soul came to check on us or refill water.  Restaurant was not overly crowded.Still a good dining experience.  Four stars.	1
This place rocks! Great food, good vibes, drinks, & awesome inventive food! This amazing new place is a must stop!	1
Fancy French fantastic rooftop. You feel transported to another city, if not another time.Nifty decor and potentially original tile-work. A little hard to navigate your way to the damn restaurant and bar. I didn't eat here, but I did drink. It's a little snooty in tone, but I think that's why people come here. "If you're not paying $12 a drink it must not be good." is the attitude. I guess that's part of why they pump in the All-French pop music throughout the night.And while their "lemonade" was sweet and smooth, it didn't pack a punch and it wasn't so novel in the taste department either. The other mixology drinks didn't impress in their description, but I'm usually a straight up whiskey or dirty martini kind of guy. Now if they had some bacon infused whiskey, or homemade absinthe, or some unlikely mezcals maybe we could talk, but as it is, Perch has a DELIGHTFUL downtown balcony with amazing views, and that's the real reason to come here.	1
I've had gelato in a number of Italian cities. This bests most of them.	1
Full disclosure - I&#39;m a BIG fan of Dig Inn already, so when I found out that they had just opened a new location very close to my place of employment, I nearly flipped my lid. I love how easy Dig Inn makes it for me to eat relatively well, while still feeling like I&#39;m being indulgent by eating out. <br><br>The staff at this location is BEYOND FRIENDLY. I&#39;ve seen them regularly go out of their way to serve customers. <br><br>I also love that the refrigeration/food prep area downstairs is totally visible, so that the customer can see their fresh vegetables and other foods stored and prepared. It really drives home the fact that I&#39;m eating real, fresh food. <br><br>Love it! Will be back many more times, and am looking forward to when they finally get their wine/beer/kombucha taps going!	1
Brilliant sauce on baked oysters. Perfectly dressed salad with fresh lemon accent. Parsnip cake and sauce on snapper well done. Malted milk ice cream tastes just like the candy. Service is attentive but not overbearing. Great dinner.	0
Food: unapologetically rich. This could be good or bad depending on your tastes. I ordered the burger (honestly dear yelpers, I don&#39;t think you need an egg or the bacon in it, unless you want to bring yourself closer to a heart attack! It was already so rich in itself.) and the bacon on the side. The bacon I ordered because of yelp recommendations. I wish I didn&#39;t. It&#39;s bacon. The burger was good but hello, there was a strand of hair in it. Hurray. Not.<br><br>Service: good at first then terrible towards the end. We waited for the check for so long, I had to STAND UP and actually go to someone at the bar to ASK FOR OUR BILL. This was lunchtime on a Tuesday. I don&#39;t care if the restaurant was full. Service should still be good, especially for a place that is known for a 1 to 2 hour wait. Oh, maybe THIS is why there&#39;s a 2 hour wait.<br><br>Summary: good food but not worth the wait or the crappy service. Be sure to go work out before or after your meal.	0
Bratalian is our favorite! We go once a week and always look forward to eating there again, what more can i say?!!!	1
Bars range from $3 to $5. Good place to buy unique chocolate candy and bars. Perfect for gifts for those out of state.	1
Great Place and Vibe. Been here three times, once before a show, once for a sit down dinner, and once for drinks after work. Each time was a great experience. Being a Chef I am a fan of big, bold but simple flavors, I hate dishes that are overly complicated and take a paragraphs to describe. one maybe two exotic ingredient tops in each dish if any, please. RW delivers in the food Department with that criteria. Rich Smoky Meats. Twists on Classics, Fresh, bold and original combinations, making me say Hmm... why didn't think of that? and Oh... I am so Stealing this! The Service is always friendly and knowledgeable. Being in the Biz for over 25 years I can tell immediately if a place is squared away, and when the crew is genuinely having fun, and this is one of those places. I am also a HUGE fan of whiskeys, if there's one I see that I want, I'll usually order it before even thinking of the price. Se la vie. The gal who does the blending and infusing of the liquors does an excellent job. and comes up with what I call Real as opposed to Frou Frou Cocktails, they always lean towards the classics in the sense, i could see several being a regular drink of mine. They are most often reasonably priced when compared to super high-end whiskeys. not Cheap But indeed Fair. Overall A great and fun place to hang out with a bunch of character and soul. I love old Seattle Buildings. P.S. those bitching and moaning about no AC and it being Soooo Crowded, lighten up Butter Cup and learn a little patience, the world is really short on it these days.	1
Service was great but the sushi was very plain. Could use some special rolls on the menu as well.	0
This was my second time here.Not crowded. But the service here is ridiculous!My friend and I met up with 2 other people who were already here. We were sitting for about 15 mins and no one came up to us so my friend tried to get a waitress' attention but she ignored us. Another friend tried to get a waitress' attention but again we were ignored. So I raised my 2 arms up and waved it back and forth and yelled if we could get a menu so we could order. A lady rushed towards us. I had been sitting in the restaurant for about 40 mins with my tummy grumbling really loud! We finally received the ramen we each ordered but were never given napkins and chopsticks. Also at this point we found that the restaurant had a check in offer through Yelp of free daimaru or gyoza. So again we flagged for a waitress so we could order daimaru and ask for napkins and chopsticks.She came. With half of her attention to us and the other half trying to sit a group down we asked for the daimaru and then she immediately walked away. This didn't give us a chance to ask her for utensils so we just grabbed some from another table. I don't have a clue what was up with the people at Genki Ramen last Monday but I surely will not return here. The place was not busy at all and service was HORRIBLE!!! The first time I came here my waiter was very kind!! Very helpful and even took the time to describe to me what each appetizer was. But this second time was just horrible!!!	0
Big portions. With the price I paid, it served me approximately two meals.<br><br>Old-fashion breakfast. The menus of what they are serving for the day is listed on the chalkboard. Being not much of a meat eater, it was a disadvantage seeing so many dishes containing pork or beef. I did find a chicken dish --fried chicken and decided to give it a shot. My sister ordered her bacon and scrambled eggs. Our waiter was extremely attentive and did a lot to accommodate us. <br><br>According to my sister, bacon was extremely greasy and fatty. But I thought that is what bacon is really suppose to be. Scrambled egg was so bland she had to add in salt and pepper to even make it edible enough for her to eat. At least she like her toast since it was warm and delicious.<br><br>I had no complaints regarding food quality. But food quantity? Wowza. I was served with two big thigh pieces, a wing, and a drumstick. The fried chicken also came with sides of corn, mashed potatoes with gravy, coleslaw, and toast. I definitely do not dare to complain about being hungry after leaving the cafe since I was stuffed...like a chicken, ready to be fried up to be someone else&#39;s meal. lol	1
Hubby and I had a great dinner - lamb vindaloo was tender and at 3 stars just enough spice for me! The exterior does not look too appealing but the interior is nicely arranged and even with a big crowd the service is excellent.	1
Horrible service! Took the waitress forever to bring out a house salad and few appetizers. Food was whatever with not much taste. Took another decade to bring out a dessert.	0
I like the dated atmosphere, and the fact that they are open 24 hours. The last time I came here, it stunk like salted meat really bad from the entrance on. I can tolerate the smell of meat generally, but it didn't smell good. The food isn't amazing, but you have a decent amount of choices late at night, so it's not at all bad.	1
Was so excited for this from reading some reviews. Got food delivered, took a while but wasn&#39;t worried as I thought they&#39;re a popular place so wud be busy. Ordered chips n guacamole, pollo burrito, mexi sausage tacos, steak tacos and pollo tacos. Some of the blandest food I&#39;ve ever had, dry and no spice or flavour. The only saving grace was the mexi sausage taco, which was good I must say. The guacamole was overly bulked out with onion and tomato. The burrito was just plain bad. Good chips though.	0
This was the first place I went to when I first moved here a year ago, and have gone many times foolishly thinking it would just magically get better. Like when you have a crappy car, and you think "Hey, maybe if I just turn up the stereo and keep driving, I can just ignore the fact that my car is completely falling apart and on fire". It's like that. I keep going, thinking somehow it's just going to magically change. But it just magically gets worse.The straw that broke the camel's back, was when I went there in the early afternoon on a weekday. It took almost 40 minutes to get service to take our order. I ordered the mac and cheese with bacon. As we waited almost an additional 30 minutes, we looked around to see that there was one other table next to us, 2 firemen, and that's IT. In the WHOLE place.When I got my mac and cheese, it was in a small ramekin. I forked into it, to find watery butter and a bunch of bacon. I'm actually 85% sure there was NO CHEESE. IN THE MAC AND CHEESE. It was the most bland, awful, butter water soup i've ever had. for $8!!! What!I was so furious. I should have spoke up. I lay awake at night wondering why the hell I didn't speak up when I was forking over my money. I wondered why I ate that. I wondered why Firefly was cancelled so abruptly. Same with My So Called Life. Anyway...I'm breaking up with The Wood. It just doesn't satisfy me. In fact it just angers me.	0
Toast, as you might have guessed from the other reviews, is a place where celebrities and would-be celebrities congregate for chic and hip dining during the day. When I went, I swear everyone, including the staff, looked like they could be a model, a movie star, or some other celebrity. In short, everyone was beautiful.Ok, but on to the food. The food was very tasty and well prepared. I had the french toast with mixed berries while my girlfriend had the portabella mushroom omelette. Both plates were fantastic. And from the look of what other people were having, it seems like the food is generally really good. As for the service, it was indeed quick and were cheerful and friendly. It makes up for the long wait you will need to endure if you go during peek hours (9am-12pm on a weekend).Yay, four star review!	1
Pastrami sandwich: piled high with lean, tasty, pastrami on very good rye bread. Good selection of spicy mustards<br>Stuffed cabbage entree: sweet and sour. enormous portion. Hot and juicy. <br>Potato knish: not quite like I used to get in Coney Island but awfully close and just excellent.<br>Potato pancakes: spiced just right and fried to a crisp.<br>Corn rye bread from the bakery: the best I&#39;ve eaten in years.<br>Cherry phosphate for me: I&#39;m 14 again. Guiness for my wife: there are Jews in Ireland, you know. And there are Irish Americans eating pastrami sandwiches in Canter&#39;s who like Guiness with their meal.<br>I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve enjoyed a meal this much in a long time. 75% good comfort food, 25% nostalgia for my teen years.	1
My husband and I decided to eat at Bahama Breeze for our Valentine&#39;s Dinner. We were seated quickly, and our server was also quick to take our order. For the emptiness of the restaurant, our burgers took a very long 20 minutes. You couldn&#39;t tell there was any cheese on our burgers and the lettuce and tomatoes were old and soggy. We got our burgers at 10:10 and that was the last time we saw our sever until 10:40 to get our check. We will not be returning to this restaurant.	0
Amazing! Great prices. The neighborhood is sketchy at best but it&#39;s well worth it. Don&#39;t expect great customer service or even a smile but the curtido makes up for it. The only thing I don&#39;t understand is why they use pinto beans instead of black or red beans with the eggs and platanos which is why I gave 4 stars...	1
We went at vero last week and we try the special cappellacci beef and mushroom served with white sauce fantastic .. The service Was excellent .. I really love the place	1
Pho is good but on the lighter side. It was still good and definitely not bland. I added some of the chef&#39;s &#34;special&#39;s sauce&#34; in my broth along with sriracha and it gave it a punch that I enjoyed. <br>The owner is really nice and even gave me extra broth and noodles without me asking. <br><br>I would go back. The shrimp spring rolls and BBQ pork were really good and fresh.<br><br>The chef&#39;s &#34;special&#39;s sauce&#34; is a hit with all of the above. Yum!	1
Great chicken burger, brioche buns x secret sauce = good eating	1
I have now dined at 2 of these restaurants (Chicago and Boston) and I must say that BOTH times I've walked away impressed by the food and the service....even though I was expecting it!	1
Very fresh food and they give you ice cream at the end of your meal. Well, at least for lunch they do.	1
I would like to stop exercising and healthful living/eating and try to shack up in Canter&#39;s for a month. The results may not be pretty but I am ready. The place is a time warp with deep Jewish history that fascinates me. <br><br>The place is a 24 hr diner but I really am only able to comment on the fabulous chocolate ruggalah and sweet orange/cinnamon/raisin bread we got. Both were fabulous but I want to try it again. I will force my LA friends to take me there in a few months when I am back down. Fortunately they have parking next door with the friendliest attendant ever and he made up for the straight faced teen working the pastry counter.	1
Bleh - First time , today is Tuesday , and I order some tostones ( they were really bad )! With Maicitos , bad presentation ,the service was ok , the lady look pretty bored and tired . Not coming aging , somehow disappointed .	0
One of my favorites... <br>It is one of those places where &#34;everybody knows your nameeee&#34;... The sushi is not the best sushi in town, but it&#39;s good! I usually have the rainbow roll with brown rice and it never disappoints me... My husband always, yes always, gets the gyoza platter (5 steamed gyozas with salad and rice). <br>During Christmas they had a very nice gesture with their customers, they gave out 10% off coupons and a set of really nice chop sticks... We went like 4 times in December, so we are hooked up with 4 discounted meals until June and plenty of chop sticks to throw a Japanese themed night dinner at home. <br>I highly recommend this place for what it is... A homey, good sushi restaurants with very, very decent prices.	1
Went here with some friends for DineLA and the experience with mediocre. They were missing two of the items on the DineLA menu because they didn't have them in stock. They got our order wrong, we asked for no bleu cheese in "The Six" burger and their service was subpar.We asked multiple times about the status of our order and one of the waiters from the back said it'd be one more minute when we ended up waiting for another 5 minutes on top of already extensive wait. Some of the food was good but I wouldn't come back and I certainly wouldn't come back for the service.	0
while out for our evening stroll, my husband and I decided to stop in for a bite. it was their first day open and we had been anxiously awaiting this new restaurant. the staff were very accomodating (we had the baby in a stroller) and prompt. while there were two awful servers, the rest seem to have plenty of fine dining experience and soon eclipsed the bumbling amateurs, taking over where those two fell behind. I know it is common to overhire for an opening and then weed out the less talented, so those two servers are likely gone hy now. the food. wow. I was unable to spend much time at table, as my munchkin decided to become cranky right after we ordered. there I was, walking to and fro, bouncing my chubby little guy whilemy husband enjoyed what looked like black ravioli (made wih squid ink). he thoroughly enjoyed every bite, then took our baby for some play time at the fountain whilst mom ate her own food. I had the Other ravioli, which was delicious. next time we will make it a grown ups only event so that we may enjoy our repast more fully.	1
Denny's for the hip and hopeless.	0
Perch has got some serious style... and we didn't even go the rooftop bar. Came here for dinner and it takes 2 elevators to get to the floor for dining. Vaulted ceilings with low lighting set the standard. We also sat in a small table facing most of the restaurant and bar. Nice lounge chairs instead of dining chairs at our particular table. A basic heirloom tomato salad to start. Salmon for the main dish. Solid entree along with a few bites of risotto from Rachel's plate. The only downside was the dessert. The bread pudding was a bit dry and came out piping hot. As we stepped outside on our way to catch a flick, a massive line had formed to get in. Next time, I'll head up to the rooftop.	1
Best breakfast ever. Open 27/7 365. No locks on doors. A restaurant of restaurants!!!!!!!!!!	1
Celebrated my birthday here because it looked tasty and was near my brother&#39;s house and I&#39;m very glad we did. The service was enthusiastic. The wine and beer selection were small but well curated. The space was cool and unusual (it&#39;s pretty much a small, southern-style house). The food was delicious and reasonably priced. We had a bottle of wine and some beers along with the beef cheeks and hummus, lamb belly, roasted cauliflower and Jerusalem artichokes. Mediterranean comfort food. Everything was excellent. The waitress seemed a little frazzled but was super friendly and offered lots of menu advice. Will dine there again.	1
More like 3.5 stars. The chicken fingers here are not brought in on a truck frozen they are made fresh. The chicken is seasoned nice and I like to add their hot sauce to the sandwich combo they have. The coleslaw was not good in my opinion and the fries are good if you eat them right away but don&#39;t hold up well if you get your order from the drive thru and eat at home. Decent option from the usual burger fast good options.	1
My fiance and I went to Fogo de Chao for Valentine's Day this year and to celebrate his birthday.  We had an 8:00 reservation however, we were taken to our table as soon as we walked in the door (7:45 or so).  A waiter quickly came to our table to explain how the restaurant worked and offered us a wine menu.  The drinks took some time to arrive but that was fine because we were in  no rush.  The salad bar is fantastic, there were several choices and the food looked fresh and well stocked. Once we moved on to the meat portion, it took some time for the various servers to arrive but again, we weren't in a rush.  The check took an unusually long time to arrive. Aside from that, everything was great, the atmosphere was romantic and perfect for valentine's day.  I look forward to coming back.	0
Super awesome view of DTLA. Eclectic crowd ranging in age from mid 20&#39;s to early 40&#39;s (me, lol). No stupid attitude patrons, great staff, and not too crowded that you can&#39;t move. I&#39;ve been here on Saturday night a handful of times and have yet to not enjoy. Drinks are typically priced for the area (about $8 to $10 for a mixed drink). Do arrive early unless you like to stand in line for 45 minutes. It happened to me but the doorman and hostess were not snooty or anything like that. Totally professional pair of people. Also, the DJ that night was nice enough to explain her sound system to me while she mixed the tunes. How nice is that? Pros: No cover, the view, easy to get to, good bartenders, chill crowd. Cons: I can&#39;t party there as often as I would like :-(	1
Best Pizza in Seattle.	1
I am now officialy a hater! I&#39;ve never been so humiliated!! Went there a couple times with friends on Friday nights for drinks and liked the atmosphere. This Saturday for a late lunch I felt like going back for a burger. I stepped it with my husband, asked for table, looked in the room and was happy to see a few tables available by the window but the hostess told us with the most condecedent tone that they didn&#39;t have any table available before a half hour!!!!!!!!!!! :o What the F!!!!	0
This was my 2nd Anniversary and we wanted a 'little- special' nite.  Bacio was good, but not really 'what' I had envisioned my night being.  No fault of the Restaurant..just not really as Romantic and Quaint as I had hoped for.	1
There is no comparison, it&#39;s like a time machine back to 1920&#39;s Paris. My wife and I can&#39;t stay away from this place. The food, the atmosphere, the staff. We always ask for Carlina because she&#39;s just awesome. Can&#39;t wait to go again, and again.	1
Love this place. Needed a meal at around 11 PM, hadn&#39;t had time to eat much all day and I had to go to the gym afterwards. I assumed my only choices would be crappy fast food. Somehow I found this place on yelp and not only is it open till 3 AM, it&#39;s super healthy and delicious. The lady helping me was very nice, she made a great turkey sandwich, brought it to my table with silverware and the whole deal, all for 6 bucks! They have these protein snacks that looked pretty good, will have to try that next time.	1
Im sorry, I know many people think this joint is the business but No. <br><br>I ordered the Daikoku ramen expecting to have a Foodgasm but all I got was an <br>egg-y greasy tasting bowl of ramen. Would I give this spot a second try? I think not, <br><br>Can I have my 25 cent pack of Top Ramen Noodles? Thank You!	0
Excellent for lunch. A variety of items depending on how hungry you are. Only problem parking is ltd	1
I went to Tanglewood for lunch this week and it was great! I love the updates they made from the previous restaurant especially the bar around the kitchen to allow patrons to sit and watch the chefs work. 	1
OMWord.Went there because there was SUCH great reviews on the place as dog friendly. Your pet has to stay out on the "patio" which is tiny metal racks welded into the sides of the walls as tables back to back in the sidewalk area. The height of my dinning experience? The homeless woman who dropped her pants at the curb side drain and took a dump while we ate. Followed by two homeless men who did the same. 1:00 in the afternoon. Joy unconfined.The waitress was nice enough and brought out the standard paper dish of water for the pooch. same routine for all dog owners. Drop the water, pet the pooch, smile walk away. okay got it. dogs welcome. Outside of course.After going in to use the restroom (single male female toilet and sink;don't touch anything!) and seeing first hand how dirty, run down and need of repair the restaurant was the dog had the best seat in the house. Ordered the turkey burger 9.00 no fries said came with pecan coleslaw. At first I thought the patty was missing. then I found it. You know how the big mac patty is so much thinner and smaller than the bread.......well there you have it. Lots and lots and lots of bread. topped with coleslaw. Ate the patty left the rest. Waitress was kind enough to offer a doggie bag. no thanks.My guest got the fries and chicken strips he said the chicken strips were great but the fries were limp and greasy. I tasted a couple and they weren't cooked at a hot enough temp and absorbed quite a bit of grease. didn't eat the fries. Bring a doggie pad for the dog to lay on. I gave mine a bath after he sat on that sidewalk. After all the positive reviews I was very disappointed...and surprised at the 'ambiance' Most say it's one step above a Denny's. Even the very worst Denny's I've ever stopped at during a road trip has this place beat hands down.	0
What a special place for lunch! We sat on the Patio overlooking the waterfalls and golf course. Great food --- try the lobster Cobb--- and attentive, professional service.	1
CASH ONLY DINER. The set up is inefficient but nostalgic. The food is OVERPRICED and not even that tasty. The apple and pecan pies were two thumbs down. The old school waiter has his job down to a science. I tipped him 40% for being so dedicated but I&#39;ll never go back and drop $35 for a burger combo (one steak burger, one fry, one apple pie, one pecan pie and one big fat tip). 5 Guys burgers and fries are waaayyy better on all accounts.	0
I&#39;m not one to give a bad review but when a place really misses its mark, I am definitely going to share what I went through. <br><br>We went there on a Sunday afternoon and the restaurant wasn&#39;t even that busy, in fact I had the largest party (of 7) when I arrived. The server automatically brought out waters but took a couple of minutes for the menu to get to me after he was ready to take my order and realized I didn&#39;t have one. <br><br>I ordered the whole duck which came to my table room temperature, it wasn&#39;t even hot to enjoy that parts of the duck that contained a high portion of fat was too fatty to bite into. <br>The Shrimp &amp; Combination Fried Rice wasn&#39;t too bad but wasn&#39;t the best either. The ratio of noodle to veggies/seafood for their pan fried noodle wasn&#39;t well proportioned (lacked so much noodles) and finally when I ordered the pigs ear in soy sauce &amp; the spicy chicken feet, it would&#39;ve been nice to be told that these were cold appetizers. <br><br>My server was too busy catering to the other customers who were Chinese unlike me &amp; my party who were not. Even to get a water refill was almost impossible. I can guarantee you that this is definitely the first &amp; LAST time I&#39;ll be ever eating here &amp; I work for the hotel industry so I can assure you that I will spread the word to my friends that this place is by far a horrible choice to make! If I could rate it with negative stars, trust me, I would have!!<br><br>I was so disappointed because for the first time I went to a high rated establishment that was a total false rated place for me.	0
I love the food, but the service left a very bad taste in my mouth. I won&#39;t be back.<br><br>I work nearby and had a series of late nights at the office last week, so I ordered dinner from here twice during those few days. The orders were a little messed up -- two drinks were missing form the first one, and an extra item (well, a handful of tortilla chips) was added to the second. But both times I was made to feel like I was responsible for the mistake. <br><br>With the missing drinks from the first order, the cashier stopped just short of accusing me of stealing or hiding them. He told me that I had received them, and proceeded to search the to-go bag and look me up and down in an attempt to find me out as some sort of Orangina thief. I did eventually receive the two Oranginas I ordered -- because he was wrong and had forgotten to give them to me -- but not before I was made to feel like some sort of fast-casual restaurant swindler. <br><br>And with the second order, the cashier accused me of wanting freebies when I voiced my concern as she began to take my entire order apart. You see, some tortilla chips had mistakenly made their way into the box where my sandwich was packaged. The cashier opened the box, dumped out the chips, compromised the structural integrity of an already sloppy sandwich, and proceeded to double check all of the boxes for stowaway chips! I feel like that was a little overboard for some soggy chips the kitchen staff threw away anyway. And to accuse me of trying to get free things from the restaurant was way out of line. <br><br>That&#39;s just some poor training and some lack of common sense (and decency, I think). People make mistakes and that&#39;s fine, but handle yourselves with some class. Like I said before, I won&#39;t be back.	0
Sweet<br>Salty<br>Savory<br><br>Spectacular<br><br>Now I understand why the lady this small space is named for is so well known in the food world. Honestly, when my Arepa De Chocolo was placed in front of me I thought, how good could it possibly be? Really doesn&#39;t look like much for $4. What it is... a spectacular simple dish made of humble ingredients turned into a meal of pure brilliance, bliss. It will take awhile to forget the experience. Paired with a simple cup of black Columbian coffee I left a very happy man. The savory of the corn, the sweetness of the butter, the salty cheese, the combination a little bit of heaven that doesn&#39;t happen by accident.<br><br>Best part? Take the Q70 from Laguardia and they drop you off within two blocks of the place. Yet another reason to bypass the annoying yellow cabs with their surly drivers and overpriced ride in a vehicle with no shocks on bad roads.<br><br>In a city filled with overly hyped, over priced food, a little spot of heaven. After a 1,300+ mile flight, the reward at the end most worthy of the effort. Who ever said you had to spend a lot of money in NYC to eat world class? Some fool that never dined here.	1
Los Gemelos might finally be the eatery to stick in this East Gilman location that briefly housed one of those forgettable chain calzone joints. In its place is a colorful yet no-nonsense big city-style taqueria - think Chicago, San Francisco and so on. Walk up to the counter and put in your order with the friendly female proprietor. Choose from a full menu of options, including quesadillas, tamales, burritos and so on, or stick with the classic steak, or carne asada, taco, served traditional-style with onion and cilantro. The tacos come delivered to you, in the late hours, in a paper bag; find your seat, remove and unroll the little bundles of joy and - wait! Be sure to apply what appears to be house-made salsa (I recommend the green sauce), then enjoy. For a couple of bucks per taco, you will be hard-pressed to find a tastier, less expensive and higher-quality product in the downtown area, particularly in the post-dinner hours.	1
I concur with others that the service is subpar. The sign in front says wait to be seated, but they seem surprised to see you standing there! The waitress was also a bit ignorant.On the contrary, the Ramen hands down was the best I've had in my life. I'm not a ramen Expert, but I've a good stint at Ramens in this town. 5th one thing that makes this place stand out is the quality of the ingredients compared to other places that smell like grease and grit. I'll be back!	1
Good, cheap tacos on tuesday but outdated specials on yelp and outside. Not so big on the snarky bumper stickers inside, but can&#39;t really complain about dollar tacos.	1
The D&#39;Pinoy serving crew &amp; staff were hospitably friendly in welcoming me to their dining establishment. After truckin&#39; all those longhaul miles,it&#39;s nice to see friendly people....<br>The restaurant had some sort of cultural #get2gether with some cool,easy listening live music!! This was a relaxing atmosphere to enjoy eating my #karekare OxTail stew n rice selection!<br>Now...back to the regularly scheduled sunday agenda!	1
What a disappointment.Our small group was seated in the back in a room of large parties--we literally had to scream over the thumping backround music(?) and large drunken parties shouting.The service was terrible-a waitress with an attitude and we had to ask 4 times to have our water glasses filled.Food was ok but not worth going out of your way for.Never go on a Saturday night--I say stay clear of this place!	0
This was truly a bad meal. I ordered the Chopped Beef Brisket Sandwich. It was described as coming with fried onions & horseradish mayo on sourdough. What came out was a sloppy mess. The beef was mostly gristle and it was drenched in a poorly made bbq sauce. They should have used a sourdough roll instead of sliced sourdough because it ended up just being a sponge for the nasty sauce. We also ordered the BLT salad w/ chicken extra. The salad arrived without chicken, so the waitress said she'd bring it right out. After 15 minutes, it still hadn't arrived so we cancelled the chicken. (Oddly enough, the chicken still arrived on our bill.) You'd think that a salad full of blue cheese, bacon & avocado would be bursting with flavor, yet somehow they were able to sap the taste out of that as well. All the while, though the restaurant was sparsely filled, it was impossible to find our waitress. We both wanted to send our meals back, but had little faith that the kitchen would be able to execute anything edible or that our waitress would deliver it in time.The place deserves one star, but I give it two because 1. It was clean. 2. I was donkey enough to expect decent food at the wharf.If you need to eat near the wharf, just hit In-N-Out, Eagle Cafe, Caesar's a couple blocks away, or Sweetie's.	0
We always come here for desserts n appetizers plus the wines, great selections. The ever delicious pudding, oh my! my never ending craving is always satisfied. As usual, reservations is a must so u don&#39;t hav to wait. Their appetizers is one I say the best, of all the restaurants I&#39;ve been n Dtla. Although its a bit pricey n servings r small, we always order double portions. The best of all is the customer service, I&#39;ve been here 5x n its always a pleasurable experienced n well entertained. Plus the nice view n ambience, I always recommend this place to my friends	1
The bartender was extremely rude, don't get the Margarita.... It tastes horrible and if you say anything about it, they will give you grief, not worth it!!!	0
The food was excellent, the service was excellent, and the ambiance was great. If your from Vegas or just visiting Vegas this is a must try. One of if not the best Michael Mina restaurants I&#39;ve been to. I highly recommend trying the beef tartare and the Duroc pork chop.	1
Been to this fine establishment several times within a one month period. A clear indication that I like. The cuisine has southern and caribbean influences such as their whole porgy with hot peppers reminiscent of an escoveitch. Other standouts were the slow cooked oxtail and that delicious fried chicken. Portions on the chicken were generous one night then significantly smaller on the most recent visit so they need to work on their consistency. Hope they bring back Not Another Kale Salad which was a great appetite opener. All in all a comfortable neighborhood feel and good solid food.	1
I love this place. Very old school! Their burgers are alright (I&#39;ve had better) but I absolutely love their french fries. And if you love pie - this is the place to go to. Their apple pie and banana cream pie are fantastic. (You&#39;ll have to drop by before 8 pm if you want the banana cream pie). <br><br>Note: The wait can be verryyyyyyyy long if you wanna sit down.	1
The Seafood Risotto special on Sat. night was outstanding.  The flavors were excellent with the exotic mushrooms.	0
Amazing happy hour specials including food. Food pretty middle of road but good selection.	1
Although I'm not much of a carnivore, every now and then I feel a certain craving for the noblest cut of the cow--the tongue. Back when I was in Japan I found out that the most delicious and the only way to cook this oft-overlooked part of the cow is to peel off the thick hide from the tongue thus revealing the soft juicy meat under it, perhaps season it with a little salt and then grill the gorgeous thin cuts of meat over a charcoal fire. I was very disappointed to find that the tongue never made it as a staple cut in the American beef diet, but my disappointment was set aback when I found out that the pan-Americans and the magical restaurants that have so become ubiquitous to American cities known as "Taquerias" usually carry my preferred cut of beef as part of their delicious burrito menu. This all changed tonight when I visited El Rancho Grande.Fueled partially by an initiative to explore my immediate surroundings a little thoroughly and partially by a drunken escapade, I decided to try out the taqueria that's exactly two and a half blocks away from where I live. My first impressions of the establishment was no different from any other Taquerias I've visited all around California; little cashier's booth under neath a giant menu conveniently located aside the actual "cooking area", seats lined up across the wall with a TV playing Mexican soaps/futbol on telemundo. So assuring myself that this experience would not be any different from my usual frequentings, I decided to order my favorite cut of beef wrapped around a tortilla stuffed with rice, beans, sour cream, diced tomatoes and onion and guacamole. How can you possibly mess this up, right?Well that's where I was wrong. I'm not a burrito scientist, but the first sign of a poorly made burrito can be observed through the color of the tortilla; the tortilla was toasted/browned--to date I've never had a single positive experience with burritos when the tortilla was (nearly) burnt to a crisp. My next grievance with ERG's burrito is that the queso they used overpowered almost every flavor the burrito had to offer--if I wanted a cheesy filling Mexican dish wrapped in a tortilla I would have ordered a quesadilla. My last and final grievance with RG's lengua burrito is that it managed to capture every reason why white people don't usually eat this cut of meat; they somehow managed to overboil the lengua and thus leaving it devoid of any sort of flavor/texture whatsoever. Now I'm very passionate about my beef tongue so perhaps it's not in anyone's best interest to take what I say about this burrito au pied de la lettre, but this burrito managed to betray every expectation about the noblest cut of the beef: whereas I expected a succulent, juicy, flavorful sensation with each bite, all I got was a mushy, watery concoction that was overpowered by the overly generous flavor of cheese.Besides from the disappointing lengua burrito, the chips they gave me were the super greasy home-fried kind, which I imagine might be a plus for some and a huge gaping minus for others including myself, and their pathetic excuse for a salsa bar only had four choices: salsa verde, not-so-spicy red salsa, pico de gallo and another thing that I cannot remember at this point.Despite all their shortcomings, their food is surprisingly affordable (6.95 for a super burrito) which, in my opinion, is the only thing preventing me from giving this place a one star review. Since I was a little intoxicated when I tried this place and out of the virtue that this place is only 2.5 blocks away from where I live, I'll give this place another try on my next drunken escapade, but I know when I've been thoroughly disappointed and betrayed and this experience came mighty close to it.	0
The decor in this place is really cute. It reminds me of a cool Seattle coffee shop. Unfortunately for me, the decor is where the charm ends. This is one of those partial service establishments, where you order at the counter and serve yourself for things like beverages, condiments and water but they will bring you your food. If you're going to run an operation like this, the food either needs to be decently priced or it needs to be really good. Think Huckleberry in Santa Monica. Paper or Plastik Cafe had none of those things going for it. In a nutshell, it was bad service for over priced food that wasn't very good. When my husband and I went to order at the counter, at 10am on a Friday, they were already out of half of their menu. There's nothing that vexes me more than a restaurant that runs out of things... especially when the menu is small to begin with. The only reason for this is poor planning/execution on the part of management. My husband ordered a plan B option (they were out of huevos rancheros)... a breakfast sandwich with regular bread because they were out of biscuits. I ordered the asparagus omelet and the Zambia coffee. They brew the coffee using a Melitta which I thought was cool at first.... but the consequence of this is that the coffee gets cold quickly. My coffee was lukewarm by the time I got it and I overheard somebody go up to the counter with the same problem. The guy behind the counter said "I'm sorry but we don't have any microwaves here." If your coffee gets cold here you're out of luck. The coffee was not very good either :/The next problem was with the food itself. My omelet was just ok. It was packed to the gills with ricotta cheese that was under seasoned. I had to douse it in sriracha just to get it down. The toast it came with was cardboard-y. They didn't even serve it with any butter or jam. I asked the server for jam and he said they had some strawberry but it expired (note: wtf??). For $12+ this is unacceptable. My husband thought his sandwich was incredibly underwhelming. It was on the same cardboard-y bread as my toast and it wasn't something we couldn't throw together at home. My last issue was with the water which is in a serve-yourself beverage tub near the front door. They have the tiniest plastic 4oz cups next to it. The least they could do is offer larger cups or give you a glass bottle filled with water to take back to your table so you don't have to get up several times to refill. This place might be a cool college hang out (although I hear they're particularly strict about sitting around with your laptop) but they certainly aren't a real player in the LA breakfast/coffee scene. We wont be back.	0
Went for brunch. Delicious extremely creative food. Servers went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable. Love the interior to	1
Awesome! I had the family meal. I love this place. I&#39;ll be coming back to try everything else on the menu!	1
The worst place to have spent Valentine&#39;s Day. Yes, the view was nice and the waiters were on point for the whole evening. But the food was horrible! No taste, and itty bitty portions for both my husband and I! It was a set menu so we thought it would be a play for each, but no. Our food came in one plate...the plates were big for no reason. The food could have fit in a mini bowl. We paid $65 PER PERSON For five VERY small portions. The dessert was by far the most awful. I could have made it at home with sugar cookies and whipped cream from the 99 cent store. Hubby and I were very disappointed and couldn&#39;t wait to leave. I don&#39;t recommend anyone to come to this place if you&#39;re looking for a nice dinner.	0
Cocktails are decent. Good for lunch. Dinner atmosphere very loud, trendy, and cramped.	1
We had a girls night here with 5 of us sampling a variety of food, which all tasted good....until we all became violently sick with the exact same symptoms 24 hours later. This is the only thing we shared in common. When we notified the restaurant, no one from our group was contacted back. We have a report in with 311. So be careful.	0
thanks to groupon, i only paid 6 bucks for a meal for two. we ordered a potato knish with gravy on the side and a beef dip. ok first the knish, it's good and is a huge ball of basically mashed potatoes with a bread coating. dipping it into the gravy it tastes like thanksgiving potatoes. it's good, but i mean, it's just potatoes and gravy. my bf says it's his favorite thing to get and was ranting and raving about how good it is. the beef dip was ok. it was dry as hell even with the dip. i am not a fan. i wanted to try the pastrami and maybe thats where we went wrong because that looked a little better than the beef dip we had. the fries are good though. they were the highlight of our meal.free parking in a lot on the side of the building, which is another plus. if we ever go back i'll have to try the matzo ball soup or the pastrami to see what the hype is all about.	0
Refused service with foreign ID - I was trying to have a drink with a friend but the barkeeper refused to serve me, although I showed him an official Swiss ID card, that I&#39;d used before in that bar. He said: &#34;I can&#39;t accept anything that&#39;s not American.&#34; Bummer.	0
food was ok. the waitress was really rude? not rude but just...idk I guess she was rude. the food was just ok. the white rice tasted like the rice I make at home in my cooker. wasn&#39;t anything spectacular. 2 stars because the prices were good but the service was horrible.	0
Man the pastrami was super delicious. It had thick juicy slices of heaven. The sandwich is a tad bit high but worth the cost	1
So glad I tried this place. Amazing French Toast ! Try a Switchel cocktail. Had one top off with rum it was delicious. Love the outdoorsy atmosphere. Won&#39;t be long before this place is packed.	1
I&#39;m not sure if I would come here again. The resturant only had two tables being used but the service to order took forever. It was almost 30 minutes just to order. The hostess waiter guy wearing all black just cared way too much about chatting about hiring a new bartender girl who was refferred from john who will come in for a interview yesterday. They were talking so loud you can hear there convo from the other end of the resturant. Secondly I told the waiter no tomatoes but when my meal came out you can see a huge slice of tomatoes. So they brought it back and I again had to wait another 20 minutes. I was starving so its not a good sign. So my meal comes out the meat is completely red once you bite into it. I ask for medium very well cook fully but ughhh the waiter. I didn&#39;t enjoy my hamburger meal at all. The hamburger was filled with oil in the bun. Gross. I&#39;ve been to hamburger places where they cook the hamburger in greese for flavoring but this place the greese is like a waterfall coming down.	0
All I wanted was some decent curry close to my house.	0
Waited 30 minutes for a seat when there were seats available... Then waited 15/20 min for a damn coffee and some tea. Ridiculously snobby people... ridiculously snobby waitress... Ugh. Sooo irate! Don&#39;t bother to go here... EVER!	0
I like this place, and its atmosphere and location, and I am thrilled with its concept of gin-based cocktails - my favorite liquor. The problem is in the cocktails themselves: I tasted a few, and they all were far too sweet, syrupy, too heavy to perceive the gin. Some of the Whistler&#39;s drinks have this problem from time to time as well, but this was far worse. The Basil Bramble, for all the grenadine (or whatever it was), tasted like a pleasant citrusy and fruity beverage with an alcohol kick. The juniper subtlety of the North Shore gin was lost. The martinez had a similar problem.<br><br>My advice is to enlarge the cocktail menu to include classic, time-tested drinks which are not afraid to foreground the taste of gin.	0
Isn't this same as Serious Biscuit? I am serious :)	0
I must admit that I was skeptical about this place. I'm still trying to detox from thanksgiving, and wasn't too optimistic about a place with burgers in the headline...But, it was ok! The service was good - the decor was fascinatingly eclectic, and the food was fine. It's nothing original, but nonetheless, hit the spot. I had the breakfast special, 2 scrambled eggs, 2 pancakes and 2 strips of bacon. I couldn't even pretend to finish it...Two and a half stars because it wasn't anything special, but the service was good.	0
Came here on a Monday night and had the fish tacos special ($1 each). They were amazing!!! Purchase of a drink required to have the special. Could be non-alcoholic. I ordered a hot chamomile tea. Highly recommended!	1
I decided to try out The Brixton with my boyfriend for our Valentines date, having seen decent reviews and a constant crowd. I was underwhelmed to say the least...PROS- While waiting at the bar for our table I had the Bourbon Rasperry Splash, it was delicious and the bartender great. Definitely the best part of our eveningCONS- Freezing inside the restaurant-Ordered the spinach artichoke dip for an app. Waitress brought out the wrong thing then started going on about how unorganized the kitchen is. When we finally got the right appetizer it was runny cheese with no flavor, added salt which helped some. Served with crostini so thin it broke when you tried to scoop anything.- I had the gnocchi which was served on a hot plate, yet the entree was cold. The gnocchi was rubbery and undercooked, awful presentation also. I am a pasta lover and for the first time in my life didn't finish a pasta dish!- My boyfriend ordered the burger medium rare, It came well done. He also found a decent sized bone...in a burger! I'm a vegetarian and don't know much about meat, but never in my life has someone bitten into a burger at a nice restaurant and pulled out a bone. He left about half of it uneaten-Review of clam chowder from bf: stick with Campbells-Waitress was overly flirtatious with my boyfriend, which i did not appreciate on our romantic night out. I will definitely not be returning to The Brixton. If crappy food and overly pretentious people are your thing, by all means, be my guest	0
Pretty small menu- we ended up getting a drink at Roy's and then going across the street to eat.	0
Enjoyed it a lot. Very personal service, great food. Nice neighborhood joint.	1
Rip off. The food was crap. Tasted like some kind of chain restaurant crap that I could have gotten at Olive Garden. For the price, I was VERY disappointed. This place is a must miss!<br>The chicken parm was just a piece of chicken with sauce and cheese slapped on it with a high price tag. Save your money and go elsewhere.	0
Great service with huge portions of traditional Orleans Food at very reasonable prices. I always stay at the Orleans Hotel and eat in this restaurant	1
We had a large bachelor party booked here for months. Due to administrative error (double booking by their staff) we were told we could be seated in different areas (not as a group) or to find another venue. One star for lack of flexibility, poor customer service, and because Yelp won&#39;t let me give a zero. Sad I&#39;ll miss out trying the place as it was hyped by the organizer, but I hold a mean grudge once burned.	0
Really delicious steak. Cooked to perfection. The portions were also huge, so come hunger.	1
Chill, relaxed atmosphere. The drunken fish soup is SO GOOD. The menu is definitely peculiar which I always like. Looks like a family run place which translates to very friendly and personable staff. Should give it a go	1
We were really excited to for our brunch here, and totally disappointed. Everything on the menu sounds amazing, but almost everything we got was bland or disappointing. <br><br>Monkey bread: extremely dense nuggets of tasteless dough soaking in very thin syrup. <br><br>Chopped salad: decent, a little bit too sweet, but nice and crunchy. Definitely the best thing we ordered. <br><br>Popover benedict: popover was dry, had none of the satisfying qualities of a popover. Extremely bland, needed lots of salt. Everything was creamy/mushy, needed some kind of textural contrast. <br><br>Rib hash with poached egg: not in any way a hash. This was just hunks of meat and potatoes. Some pieces of meat were really tender and flavorful, some were dry. The potatoes were crispy and nice. Not bad, but was boring and, again, not actually hash. <br><br>Cheesy grits: not cheesy. More watery than creamy. Not disgusting, but not good. Flavorless. <br><br>The food also took forever to come.	0
First night in Chicago and this did not disappoint. C&#39;mon, &#34;The Local&#34;? Had to be decent. My pal and I split the special (Lobster Boil) as well as the 16 prime rib. So &#39;ono. Got a side of grits and sauteed mushrooms as well. Feast for royalty.	1
I was disappointed on my second visit to Bianca&#39;s Restaurant. I ordered the Gramigna con salciccia e peperoni, which is the same dish I ordered the first time I ate here because that time, this dish tasted delicious. Did they change chefs? I don&#39;t know, it just didn&#39;t taste as good. Another thing I didn&#39;t like was the atmosphere of the restaurant, it was very noisy during the evening or dinner time. Some people would say the table set up was intimate, but to me, it just looked crowded. Isn&#39;t it a code violation or a hazard in case of an emergency evacuation to have that many tables situated very close to each other in such a small space? Also, there&#39;s nothing pleasant about eating inches away from another diner&#39;s table and on top of it, the noise level is not an ideal atmosphere to catch up with friends for dinner. If you do decide to still eat here, I advise that you bring enough cash because they don&#39;t accept credit cards.	0
I'm always running around, trying to find new spots to enjoy a good cup of coffee. This happens to be one of the first cafes I checked out when I moved to madison a few months ago.	0
Da. Hype. Iz. Real.	1
I dined there with a date for Restaurant Week, and I have found a gem.  The location is convenient with historic architecture, and the service was outstanding.  Starting off with a bannini cocktail, it had the right combination of liqueurs and is now a favorite of mine.  The vegetarian baklava was creative, very flavorful without gimmicks, and well presented.  Absolutely delicious.  The portions are generous, the service was very attentive but unobtrusive, and the setting is very romantic.  Chef Wecker visited the tables toward the end of the evening and spent a few minutes answering questions about the history of the inn and more.  I will dine there often.	0
It pains me that a meal this wonderful is all too rare an occasion. I parked nearby expecting only a light meal, but got so much more. I indulged and had the tasting menu with pairings. I almost regretted eating in-n-out an hour before, and that's nearly blasphemy. We began with an oyster topped with caviar, and the wonderful luxuries of the menu unfolded from there. It would be exhausting to list all the delicacies, but these come to mind at the moment. As a fan of unusual cuisine, the sweet bread was a joy. A rich organ meat, its heartiness is divine. In another dish, a vibrant yellow aji sauce invigorated the tongue and hamachi sashimi. If I wrote this review another day, I would recall different dishes, but I will always praise the spectacular service I received at Ray's.Throughout my meal I was promptly and politely aided by two servers, both named Paul, and a series of other employees. The first Paul welcomed me into the restaurant's essentially transparent structure, and was engaging and charming. His description of the day's special, the sweet bread, truly inspired me to spring for the tasting, and his knowledge of the chosen wines is now a gem in my own sorely limited vault of sophistication. The other Paul, an equally pleasant and helpful server, as eloquently as the other informed us of our food's grandeur, all the while checking on us at comfortable intervals. The exemplary service, all the way down to the knowledgable food runners, when combined with the tantalizing plates invite the weary to relax and acknowledge that despite traffic, tickets, or any tough talk, life looks quite nice warmly watching the sun set from inside their glass haven.I will admit, there were some downsides to my experience at Ray's. I nearly slipped into a coma from licking the plate clean eight times. I flaked on a friend because I was enjoying myself there for too long. But my primary concern, the one issue stands above them all, is how can I do this more often?	1
The menu is huge! The place is outdated, as it should be. Two dining rooms and a second floor? Why so big? I had the hard salami on delicious rye bread. So good. Coleslaw was soso. I want to come back to try more on the menu.	1
Maybe I&#39;m a bit snobby when it comes to cuban food because I&#39;m from Miami, but this was ok. The food was fine but the portion was ridiculous. If I&#39;m going to pay 13 dollars for a dish that is consisted of rice beans and pork (as cheap as it gets to make) I expect to have a man sized portion. instead.... I got a $13 happy meal.	0
When you only have an hour for lunch, the choices are very limited. Especially since you have to take into consideration traffic time and cooking time. Lemon Poppy Kitchen was relatively close to my training site so my friends and I ventured over here for a quick bite to eat. It&#39;s a small little cafe. I can see it being very crowded during peak brunch and lunch hours. I also think their specialty is more towards breakfast rather than lunch since their lunch menu was extremely limited. Service was friendly though. <br><br>I ordered their turkey avocado salad. They actually didn&#39;t have any salads but apparently any of their sandwiches can be turned into a salad, so I opted for that. Maybe that&#39;s why my salad wasn&#39;t really all that great. I mean, it didn&#39;t taste bad or anything but it was just so boring. And I do like my salads underdressed but this was VERY underdressed. Bordering on raw. Which I could see as a huge turn off. Actually there wasn&#39;t a dressing at all. It was just straight up balsamic vinegar so I don&#39;t know if it would have helped that much. Some of my friends did order sandwiches but none of them finished. Actually one of my friends had an allergic reaction to it even though she specified before she ordered that she was allergic to a certain type of cheese and needed that changed. Maybe the servers just forgot. <br><br>Overall, for $9, i expected a better salad. A properly dressed salad for one and the portion size was ridiculously small too. Not too happy about it but maybe their brunch stuff is better. 2/5	0
Had been looking forward to the experience, booked ahead of time and arrived with my girlfriend early to our reservation but denied seating by the window because I was not &#34;dressed formally enough.&#34; The staff who was assigning seats seemed almost upset that I was simply wearing a jacket. Every customer in the restaurant was seated by the window, with about three window seats remaining. One seat remained empty for a good two hours. Food was well above average, amazing view, and our waiter was nice but the arrogance of the staff (both reception and seating) was pretty embarrassing. Would have just left if my girlfriend hasn&#39;t been looking forward to it for the last month. Not worth spending $360 to be treated like a second class citizen. Dress to impress the staff if you choose to dine here, because the food by itself wont do the price justice.	0
We came here for lunch while at LACMA. I was a bit disappointed after looking at the menu. Most of the items that I wanted to try weren't available until after 3PM, even for a pizza! Ended up sharing this house made pasta dish that I can't seem to remember the name. It was way too rich and buttery for my taste and the portion was tiny! We also had a beer and 1 well drink and tab came to $50w/tip. I don't mind paying for good food and drinks but that is a bit way overpriced for what it really is.	0
First time here and wasn&#39;t given any direction as to how to be seated. A server gave us attitude when asked her where we could sit. The wait staff in general was unsanitary and unprofessional. The bus boy was walking around with big headphones listening to music, the cook was on his cell phone while cooking and the cashier was sitting behind the counter eating. Overall there seems to be an unorganized structure of how this place operates. Then only good thing I can say is that my blueberry bagel was good. Will never come back here.	0
Went there because a friend had a coupon/online deal and decided to try it. <br>What a disappointment! <br>It&#39;s a mexican restaurant but they had NO AVOCADOS! (mind you, it&#39;s avocado season...send an employee to WinnDixie down the street if you have to!) <br>So there was no sliced avocado garnish for the salad or fish tacos and there was no guacamole. <br>Normally I would have left at this point but I was with two other friends and on a time crunch. <br>The fish tacos were only available fried and came with a heavy cream sauce that gave the plate a monotonous flavor.<br>The food overall was average, nothing to rave about and the only reason I would give it 2 stars, not 1 is because the waitress was doing her best to accommodate us. But I would much rather go to Taco Rico in the Gables, Guadalajara by the Falls or even Lime or Moe&#39;s for that matter!!	0
I let Sara the Bartender choose a cocktail and wine for my meal. She was awesome. I finished the dinner with the bolognese. I may be back this week!	1
Let me start by saying that they have the best burger that I&#39;ve tried in a long time - the mushroom and swiss with a veggie patty. However, I&#39;ve only been able to eat this in 1 out of 4 attempts. <br><br>The 2nd time we came they were out of veggie patties, along with soap in both bathrooms, paper towels in both bathrooms, and perhaps water because they never brought it to us. <br><br>The 3rd visit we came at 6:15pm on a Tuesday, knowing that they opened at 6pm. The door was locked and closed, no sign explaining. We waited 10 minutes and then left. <br><br>I came back tonight really wanting to eat the mushroom &amp; swiss again. They are chronically understaffed so we waited in line a line of 10 people for 15 minutes. The one girl working the front area is very nice but can&#39;t serve beer, run orders, take orders, clean tables, and bus tables on her own on a Saturday night. We finally got our order in and had a seat. 30 minutes later the overworked girl told us they were out of veggie patties. <br><br>This place has great food (when they have it) but I will not be coming back due to the chronic understaffing, poor customer service, and unreliability.	0
Incredible sushi joint. The staff is attentive and friendly. The waiter recognized me after coming in a few weeks in a row. The sushi is delicious and inexpensive. My entire lunch today cost $10 and I left feeling very satisfied. The spicy tuna roll and wakame soup (seaweed soup) are both amazing. The green tea mochi is good, but not amazing. I love this place and will definitely be back next week!	1
The food was okay, nothing amazing by any means, but the quality of service was awful. Waited and waited and rarely saw our server. Had to finally ask the bus boy for the check.	0
Delicious bakery and good coffee. What more can I say!	1
NEVER AGAIN.<br><br>Pies N Thighs has the right idea, but they fuck it up completely. <br>1. Catfish: Too much pepper and spices. It was extremely dry and it actually made me nauseous because the flavor was too strong.<br>2. Service: The man behind the counter was totally unwilling to assist, and had the &#34;don&#39;t ask me any more questions&#34; kind of attitude. You can tell that he works at a fried chicken joint...he was BIG.<br>3. Corn bread: Too crumbly! I think the most important aspect of a corn bread is the uncrumbliness. No one wants a corn bread that&#39;s gonna fall apart when you try to break off a part of it.<br>4. Price: It&#39;s overpriced<br>5. Customers: Every girl waiting outside to be seated talked very loudly and had the stupidest things to say. Ohh attention whores.	0
It was real full expect a bit of a wait, but the food was the best Cuban food I have tasted in a while. Believe the hype.	1
Their fiery "Bul-Dak" chicken is definitely fiery and tasty. I love the nurungji at the bottom. This is the kind of place that would be perfect at night when you're stoned and want some good food and cold beer.	1
I'm giving TP a 2-star rating instead of 3-stars because of customer service. My parents were visiting from CA and it was their first time to this restaurant. I had been raving about it and even saved it for their last night in town. We arrived at 9:30pm and went to grab a seat in the bar - I've always come at happy hour and sat in one of the bar booths at the back of the restaurant, so I brought my parents back there and sat down. A bar back brought us waters and we carried on our conversation. About 10 minutes later a rude waitress/server came over and asked who had sat us there. We told her there was no one up front to seat us and being that we'd always gone for open seating in the bar, that was what we did again. There wasn't a reserved table tent on the booth/table and no one even spoke to us until we were rudely told to get up and find another table. Looking around, I noticed there were 4 other empty tables in the restaurant, so we went to one of them and repositioned ourselves. Not a great way to start the meal.	1
Random find while passing by...super happy!Cute small dark bar & restuarant! The food was great! I had the bowery salad which was so tasty and my friends loved all their food. I totally enjoyed the vibe here at night. Very classy bar feel but with good food!If I lived in this city I'd make this my spot!	1
I have really mixed feeling reading this place. I think most of the staff and the owners and friendly and happy and want to do good. But they are the slowest when it comes to making food. I'm not talking about during the busy lunch hour, that I understand with a ton of people all at once. The mornings when there is one or two customers it usually takes 10-15 minutes to just get a bagel with cream cheese. I guess the cooks are prepping for the day. No sense or urgency at all. I stopped going there after more than once having to ask the counter person if my bagel was ready yet. It's close to my office, they use good ingredients, but they only seem to care about prepping for the lunch people. It's too bad. Stopped going there, doubt I would give them ano0ther chance after so many failures.	0
Neat, unique spot with good prices on tasty food. They slice the beef in front of you; It's not some slurry from a hose. Would return.	1
Yummy Southeast Asian flavors. Something as simple as their basic Coconut Lime Rice was so freakin good! Made with Jasmine rice, coconut milk and a hint of lime, BOMB! For Protein I was head over heals crazy in love with their Coconut Lemongrass Steak. I like my foods overloaded with Lemongrass flavor and this hit the spot. Wasn&#39;t a fan of the Shrimp &amp; Pork Meatballs rubbery texture. Apparently it&#39;s one of their top selling items but to each his own. <br><br>The SAMBAL TOFU looked real good though I haven&#39;t had the chance to try it yet. It&#39;s marinated organic tofu stir-fried in a lemongrass spice blend. Hello, Lemongrass! Must be delish! ;) <br><br>I looooove Kale, they offer it as a Veg topping! Either mixed with Baby kale and green leaf or as Green kale infused with garlic and ginger oil, sprinkled with salt and pepper.<br><br>Definitely recommend trying their Lychee Mint Tea. I believe they puree fresh lychee and use it as a base. Tastes so naturally sweet, tropical &amp; delicious. <br><br>For dessert they offer Kaya Toast. Wasn&#39;t familiar with this item until now. Looked up what Kaya was and apparently it&#39;s mainly found in Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. Kaya is like a fruit butter spread made with coconut milk, eggs and sugar. Very rich and fatty from the coconut milk which translates to tasty. <br><br>Overall, I was very pleased with this new casual joint. Very pleased to find something new and different from the norm.	1
Very good authentic food! The owner is very sweet and always make sure that you&#39;re satisfied. The only compliant I have is that the food takes long to come out.	1
Swear I walked past this place twice before I realized where it was, literally a whole in the wall!	0
From 3 to 4 stars	1
Have been here three times now and as other reviewers have noted, service can be really slow. I didn't mind waiting the first two times when it was fairly full. Was here on Saturday for lunch and place was half filled. Took awhile to get seated bcz waitress was doing her makeup near the beverage station. Took even longer to order although food came fast. Ramen was unevenly heated with cold potato chunks. The charming hand drawn menu and signs are gone. Very disappointed that the service has not improved in the last few months and that the quality of food has gone down. Not planning to return.	0
The only good thing were the garlic knots they served before our pizza and salad arrives.  The salad was wilted and the pizza was just ok...	0
This is a must do for all Chicagoans! Good burgers, amazing loaded fries and boozy milkshakes (which sadly I&#39;ve yet to try).<br><br>Small clean interior with 6 tables but I prefer the small 6 table sidewalk patio.<br><br>Both of our burgers were good , attributed in large part due to the sauces and toppings, the burger seemed to be a little dense and bland. Homemade buns topped with white and black sesame seeds was a nice touch and definitely held up to all the sauce slop!<br><br>Amazing Grace burger with Carolina BBQ sauce, fried onions and pork belly was our favorite, the sauce was sweet and delicious.<br><br>The Easy Rider burger was messy with its thick red BBQ sauce but with two thin slices of bacon I&#39;m not sure the menu description of &#39;bacon, and more bacon&#39; is really accurate!<br><br>Polish fries were by far the best part of the entire meal, huge portion of extra crispy tater sticks smothered in melted cheese, kielbasa and sauerkraut. Blue Cheese fries were good, we loved the super spicy sauce on them but wished the blue cheese chunks were smaller. <br><br>Its probably not near your house, but find a way to get there and check it out!	1
I&#39;m giving this place 4 stars with the caveat that they&#39;re new and I want them to succeed. But to echo the cons sentiment of another yelper:<br>1. Silverwear is confusing. Either have it rolled and out or direct people where to get it by putting up signs. <br>2. We arrived at open on a Sunday for brunch - chef wasn&#39;t there. He was getting supplies. I get it. The place is small and not big staff. But when you open - you had better be ready to serve food! <br>3. Food is delicious but for the price the portions are too small. Note to chef- the French toast is awesome but you have to serve 4 slices like any other neighborhood spot- especially when you&#39;re not including table service. <br><br>Pros<br>1. Nice upgrade to the hood. <br>2. Counter service means no tipping and no waiting on servers <br>3. Excellent concept and food is on the mark. <br><br>I know this guy will get his act together but I don&#39;t intend to go back for another month while he works his kinks out.	1
It angers me to be so hyped up about a place and then have to give them such a low grade rating. Overrated, overpriced and under serviced would be the top 3 ways I could describe it. I was so stoked to try the new raw bar, fresh antipasta made in front of you, outdoor seating with firepits restaurant the Hard Rock was offering. Not to mention menu choices like beef stroganoff, ribs, fried chicken, and meatloaf. I for sure thought I would be in heaven. <br>Now let me start with the 2 good things about this place.<br>1- The ambiance. It was a huge indoor/outdoor 2 bars, view of the pool. AMAZING set up. If you sit indoors, you can watch them make your antipasti platter fresh in front of you which brings me to the the highlight of the meal<br>2- THE ANITPASTI! So it was for sure over priced. $8 per cured meat. $5 per cheese. $4 per snack (snacks included olives peppers, bread, etc)<br>My super awesome platter cost $38. Sad that it was the only thing worth it. The meats were perfectly salted and the cheeses were imported. I would actually order this again if I wasn&#39;t worried about the cost. <br>Thats it. All the positives. <br>On to the reason for the 2 star rating. First and foremost the shitty service. Not only was our waiter unattentive and slow. He was careless. He didn&#39;t once offer to refill our empty glasses we had to ask. He didn&#39;t notice nor care that 1 of the 4 of us barley touched her food due to it being undercooked. (seriously meatloaf pink??) We also noted that our order was put in around 7:30, and we were patiently awaiting our check at 9:20. <br>Between us we had ribs that had jalapeno in the title, yet tasted sweet. 2 orders of undercooked meatloaf. And a steak. <br>The side items were decent, but even the taters that came with the meatloaf lacked consistency. <br>My boyfriend insisted we get dessert since all 4 of us were still hungry and there are not many places in town you can get freshly made monkey bread. Again a dissapointment. Small, and it took more like 20 minutes versus the 10 they claimed it to take. <br>Overall the bad food may have been a fluke. I could tell there was a potential for yummy-ness had they cooked the meatloaf another hour, added spice to the ribs, and a little love in their kitchen. On this trip they really lived up the the &#34;culinary dropout&#34; name and left a lot to be desired.	0
I really can&#39;t tell you how well the chicago dog was compared to others; it&#39;s the first I&#39;ve ever had. But I thought it was pretty good, even though the dog itself seemed kind of small. I guess that&#39;s just how they come. The toppings were plenty however, and the seasoned fries were delicious.<br>My favorite thing here has to be the italian beef sandwich, which comes mild or hot. Be careful, when they say hot, they mean hot, not that pussified wannabe spicy crap you get at most places. So, so good!	1
One star for our New Year&#39;s Eve reservation experience. We had used their online booking system and reserved a table for 4 at 10:15PM. Had confirmed w their email. The man and I had been a month earlier and been more than happy w our service and the flavors presented. We were very much looking forward to sharing this w close friends and bringing in the new year over small plates.<br><br>Unfortunately, we walked in at 10PM and were immediately approached by the hostess whose first and only words to us were &#34;sorry, we just closed&#34;. WHAT?! We mentioned our reservation was at 10:15PM made thru their system but were ignored. She then walked away from our party and for the next 5 minutes there was no one we could find to speak to. Standing there feeling like fools and very disappointed, we then yelp&#39;d for a nearby open restaurant and left.<br><br>Utter disappointment. Terrible response.	0
inexpensive good mexican food.... for a late night meal. 	0
Very small, cute, cozy restaurant. Hard to miss because of the blue light!<br><br>Food: 5/5. They serve small appetizer/tapas plates as well as full meals, some of which are in bento boxes! The beans were full of garlic and delicious; the purnil was a bit salty, but still packed with flavor. The arepas have a delicious sauce with them, I highly recommend them as an appetizer.<br><br>Service: generally great The staff is friendly and attentive: my glass of water was never low. I made a reservation beforehand, and they called 40 minutes beforehand to inform me that reservations were running behind and to show up half an hour later. <br><br>Overall, a great experience with fantastic food.	1
First observations: Came in with high expectations. Told them about reviews... They suggested I sit in the sushi bar to get better service.<br><br>Back door was open by the restroom. <br><br>Sake glasses had lipstick:((( <br><br>Sushi was tiny... Servers didn&#39;t have knowledge of menu and service. <br><br>I really don&#39;t know where all the good reviews are coming from...<br><br>Prompt at seating and also prompt a refilling water and drinks. <br><br>Final: I wouldn&#39;t even get a stamp card. What a disappointment.	0
ok so, i feel bad for giving this place a bad review because it is pretty new and maybe they just need to work out some kinks. i also think i ordered the wrong thing as well (the pork chop, which was fatty as hell). my pre-dinner cocktail (watermelon margarita) wasn't very good either. however, the mac & cheese was really good. it was my buddy's bday dinner that night and he got the halibut and said it was really good ... also, i hear their friend chicken is awesome. so maybe i'll give it one more shot at a later date. other pluses were the place had a good atmosphere inside ... well, besides the horrid artwork that was on the wall by our table. it's also in a terrible neighborhood, so if you're scared of crackheads, you may want to reconsider.	0
The best korean bbq in town! And the severs (especially June) treat us well and very friendly! Good job guys :)	1
might be an acquired taste, but the broth was super bland. maybe good if you&#39;re sick.. was really light. i added so much kimchi and rice to help it out until my bowl was pure red broth. very few thin slices of meat too. lots of green onions. don&#39;t really understand the hype. left a bit unfulfilled and disappointed<br><br>Ps i&#39;m use to japanese ramen, or chinese noodle soups...anything with more taste.<br><br>maybe this place is good for old people who like less sodium less oil, etc.	0
The guy who works here is amazing and very friendly. The food is delicious. I really enjoyed chicken tacos and burrito mojado. If you&#39;re in the neighbourhood, this place is definitely worth checking out.	1
Stumbled upon this place because it is like a block away from my house, and now I am a regular- at least 3-4 times a month. I overall like the food served here as well as the customer service. Love the original crispy chickens, they are the best and pretty good spicy rice cake too .It was just the right amount of spicy and just amazing.I did find a bit of inconsistency with one of the orders, which was the "honey bee chicken," the first time I tried it, I thought I was in love. But the second time I got it, it was less tasty and the sauce was not as rich. I hope the next time I order, it tastes like the first time :)	1
We were in Madison for a family funeral and took the extended family to Orient House for a very late lunch/early dinner. Not being familiar with the restaurants in the area, we used reviews from Yelp to choose this restaurant. When we arrived, there was no one in the restaurant and we were all afraid the good reviews had been misleading/inaccurate. But we were starving and even though there were two Japanese and a Peruvian restaurants right on the same street, we took our chances and walked through the door. It was the best dinning decision we've made in a long, long time.	0
Service amazing, food delicious - best Chinese I have had in America. Would definitely go again. The duck was the best.	1
I work at CHLA so we ordered take-out from here late night. The shakes were amazing! So rich and creamy, SO DELICIOUS!Mac and cheese balls were alright, not as much flavor as I would have liked.The spaghetti and turkey meatballs were surprisingly good. Turkey meatballs didn't seem enticing to me but good thing I went halvsies on them with my friend!Little bit pricey but it's pretty good food. Will have to try the Bossanova next time!	1
really bland brother there is nothing you do or add or fix the broth..........IPPUDO RAMEN YI JI BANG ! BUTTTTTTTTTTT the asparagus prosciutto is to die for :P	0
Great new spot in the neighborhood. I much prefer it to LM which used to be in this same spot. Cocktails were fantastic. Food was great. We didn&#39;t have a reservation, so we sat at the kitchen counter which I highly recommend.	1
Love the venue! Cute and classy decor. Great view of LA! I&#39;m a sucker for rooftops and nice views. <br><br>Made reservations for Sunday brunch with my girlfriends. One of my friends drank too much the night before and was running late. Pushed back the reservations an hour (no problem). Arrived and requested seating outside. Only a 10-15 min wait. Went to the rooftop bar to grab a drink while waiting. Highly recommend the Bloody Mary! <br><br>Seated and I ordered the steak frites. Steak was cooked perfect. Truffle fries were covered in a delicious cheese sauce. <br><br>While eating I found a small hair in my food. Told the waiter. He seemed confused? He picked up the plate and took it to the back, not really saying much. Wasn&#39;t sure if he even apologized? Then he came back, briefly apologized and said they were making me a new plate. Didn&#39;t expect the meal to be comped or anything but was expecting a little more than a puzzled look and meaningless apology? After that it took me awhile to flag him down and order a second drink. You think he would have checked up on us more after that incident.<br><br>Venue: 5 stars<br>Food: 4 stars<br>Service: -2 stars (1 for the hair &amp; 1 for the server)	0
Worst service ever. First thing, you can't expect much from a 24 hour diner anyways,but waitress that worked there on 7/8 was a complete b, excuse my language. First she got our order wrong. Second I didn't leave a tip and was in such a rush to get out of there I left my phone. Had no problem going back, but seeing as that I had not been anywhere else, but there, my car and my apartment that night and was texting while I was at the table it would not have magically disappeared. Well the waitress that was at our table and the cooks all couldn't find it. Didn't bother looking just said that hadn't seen the phone. So go here for diarrhea, which happened all next day and to get your stuff stolen by the help. I will tell everyone to go to Denny's or Norm's and the waitresses are thieves.	0
Given its long history and the hype that surrounds it, the apple pan falls very short. This place has a vintage charm to it, with only a counter inside. However, the burger falls flat.<br><br>Let&#39;s break it down:<br>- The patties are slightly overcooked and dry<br>- They slice off a hunk of lettuce and throw it in, and most bites are more lettuce-y then burger<br>- Bun was standard<br>- Fries were run of the mill, a little undersalted<br>- Tried the banana pie given the reviews... simply ordinary pie with banana slices rammed inside and not distributed throughout the pie. <br><br>We left with an empty feeling... hungry for a burger with strength. When it comes to LA burgers, go up the street to Five Guys or Umami instead.	0
I'm not impressed with this place. And I'm wondering why people are comparing this chain to Juicy Burger? I like the bar area, the bartender is nice, thanks to my beautiful friend, she captivates men. There was no french fries that time when I went, so I end up with the sweet potato. The burger is not that good really, the same thing with lucky devils. They are bland. I don't like bland food. It's expensive too. The place is dark inside and they got outside seating, that's the good part. It's hard to find parking. Some of my friends rave this place so I went, but I didn't find it that good. Thank you I have a good company so I enjoyed my time, but the food is worth 1 star + another 1 star for ambiance.	0
Every time we go here, I tell my dinnermates, This is the type of place I want to own some day.	0
I've been to Bloom several times, but today inspired me to finally write a review. The food is always creative, tasty, and fresh. I love the eggs benedict and the fact that we can bring our own champagne for mimosas. Today I tried the huevos rancheros which wasn't the typical Mexican style kind - that's fine, but it wasn't what I expected. I was kind of a diva and asked them to change the order, my waiter was super nice and didn't hesitate. I ended up ordering the lemon ricotta pancakes which were delish. I really appreciated the customer service today and how nice my waiter was. Thank you Bloom! This is one of my favorite neighborhood spots!	1
-Subtract 2 stars for boys being on one side of the roof and girls on the other-Subtract 3 stars for rooftop music befitting a graphic design studio in Latvia-Subtract 1 star for keystone cop doormen speaking into their shirt sleeves and fiddling nervously with their earpieces-Subtract 3 stars for bar-tending that has shot pretty far south of the mark on repeat visits-Add 5 stars for one of L.A.'s best rooftop views.Add it up and you get a one-star wish that this place will fold, and that a better-executed concept will move in.	0
We got there  earlier, our table wasnt ready yet but we didnt have to wait longer i will said 15 min. Food was delicious  our server  was super nice. I defently  go back.	1
My friends and I came here last Friday night, and I was really disappointed with the quality of food and the price. First things first, though, I will admit that we didn&#39;t order &#34;smartly:&#34; I got a fish dish, one of my friends got duck, and the other got the tagliatelle bolognese. <br><br>Here are my tips based on this experience: <br><br>1) DON&#39;T waste time and money on the appetizers. The bread and oil is quite good (not the best quality olive oil, but it&#39;s free so whatever), and the apps just weren&#39;t worth the money.<br><br>2) DON&#39;T order anything other than pasta, and have a backup plan in case they&#39;re sold out. I ordered gnocchi, but 15 minutes after I ordered the waiter came back to tell me that they had run out. I ended up ordering salmon trout which was so mediocre I got a burger from shake shack after we ate here. (Don&#39;t judge me, I have needs). <br><br>3) DO bring cash, and lots of it. <br><br>My friend&#39;s duck was very fatty, but the tagliatelle bolognese my other friend ordered was delicious. <br><br>I want to go back and try the gnocchi eventually, but I definitely will not order anything else on the menu.	0
I really love this place! Love the burgers, love everything in it! You can watch sport games and have a nice beer. The waiters are always very friendly. Great place to enjoy a nice burger with friends.	1
Have you ever wanted to travel back in time? Well one step into this place and you&#39;ll feel you&#39;ve been transported back to the early 1920s.<br><br>With only counter space surrounding the kitchen area for you to sit, make sure you go here expecting to wait or expecting to be sitting in separate groups (if you came in a big group of people). The walls are covered with plaid wall paper, popular in a time when telephones were newfangled modes of communication. Speaking of newfangled, their register is right out of the teens of the past century, with wooden buttons and a bell that rings the moment it opens. Classic.<br><br>The menu is short and sweet with no more than 10 items on the entire thing. Order a burger, either hickory or some other kind I can&#39;t recall, with cheese or not. That&#39;s about it. Side of fries with that? Sweet potato or regular? A milk shake, root beer or some other soda? Maybe you&#39;ll finish it off with one of their delicious pies, though there are only three to choose from so pick carefully. Notice that the menu gives you the dates of inception of the recipes from the burgers to the pies. You&#39;ll be amazed that it still stands up a century, literally a century, later.<br><br>Don&#39;t let the simplicity of this place fool you. The burgers are as good as gourmet with an almost sweet taste that melts in your mouth. Add whatever kind of &#34;sauce&#34; you like to it to give it that extra kick. While you may feel you&#39;ve entered into a time warp your mouth will feel like it&#39;s been elevated to heaven with each passing bite of whatever you have in front of you. You&#39;ll feel so full by the end you&#39;ll wonder how anyone went hungry back in the day. <br><br>Walk back outside with the cars whooshing past and you&#39;ll know you&#39;ve returned to the 21st century but your mouth and belly will be reminiscing for a more simple time.	1
Small place. Really slow. We ordered an appetizer but did not get it till after we asked for the bill. We had dinner and still no app. The food portions are really small as well. The only good pleasant things were the Sapporo and the mushroom garlic fried rice. Not returning	0
This is one of the best Chinese restaurants in Seattle! Next time you want authentic Chinese food venture out of the Int'l District and come here. I have eaten here several times now and have yet to be disappointed! If their awesome noodles are not your thing ask for suggestions the staff is always ready to recommend something tasty. I will be coming back here often!	1
From rice to dishes.. Very disappointed experience	0
Whiz feeds you, when you don't have the motherfucking gumption to feed yourself. Go play hard mother trucker. Polychronopolous.	1
I usually don&#39;t post reviews but I enjoyed the food so much that I just had to tell you about it. I had the chicken with rice and beans. The chicken was soooo tasty, the beans were awesome. They brought us bread w butter when we first sat down. Then with the meal they also brought plantain chips - not greasy at all. The fried boniato was excellent- not greasy. My husband had the pork chunks- also v tasty. Service was great and friendly. Wish they would have had decaf coffee though and maybe more dessert choices.	1
We have certain expectations for friendly service. Those expectations were not met. We&#39;d heard this place had a decent burger. We came in, 6pm empty restaurant, asked for table for 2, the hostess just wasn&#39;t friendly, in need of attitude adjustment for service business. She said &#34;Well we have QUITE a few reservations but we&#39;ll SEE what we can do.&#34; Um don&#39;t do us no favors, young lady! This isn&#39;t The French Laundry. It&#39;s January and it was pouring rain, and we were soaked even with our umbrellas after a cool Patrick Wilson sighting at Brooklyn Industries down the block. Hostess came back and pointed to the two tables directly in front of the door. It&#39;s January. It&#39;s cold. We&#39;re wet. Just a classic obnoxious restaurant thing to do to offer us the two worst tables in the restaurant. We offered to sit at the bar but the bartender seemed overwhelmed, spritzing seltzer into several drinks in increments over a few minutes. We peaced out and walked over to Mrs. Kim&#39;s who knocked it out of the park with sick fried chicken and these rice cakes that were a delight. Go to Mrs. Kim&#39;s everyone! Next to Vamos on Franklin. Very chill environment over there and excellent Korean fusion.	0
The best peanut butter cookie EVER!	1
Diablo I wonder why you are not always busy! Do you think its due to lack of service at your bar?I like the idea of a popsicle in your mug when ordering a michelada, however, waiting for it to melt so you can get all the flavors is really lame.I have yet to come for another try, maybe then I will add another star.	0
the food is awesome!	1
I love the original Oinkster in Eagle Rock, and was thrilled to hear about the new one opening in Hollywood. I went for lunch recently, and I liked this location at least as much as the original.The space is modern and handsomely decorated, with a brighter, trendier feel than the Eagle Rock spot. The atmosphere is still homey and casual, though, and the place delivers the slow fast food experience that put The Oinkster on the map. You order at the counter, take a number, and seat yourself. Your food comes to you, and you can help yourself to the plentiful condiments. Service is friendly, and I like the patio seating, which is dog-friendly.I abstained from beer on this particular outing, but The Oinkster has some good ones on tap. I also like the thick, creamy milk shakes, the purple ube being an Oinkster classic.The food is great. I got an Oinkster pastrami, which is what I get about two out of three visits to The Oinkster. The pastrami is house-cured and very flavorful, with thin slices stacked high--more fast food-style than, say, Langer's pastrami, but delicious in its own right. You can get it plain, but I like the Oinkster version with red cabbage coleslaw, caramelized onions, and gruyere cheese, with a pickle spear on the side. The bread can't quite handle it all, so it does get soggy sometimes, letting the sandwich fall apart. Doesn't really bother me, though. I like my pastrami with deli mustard (though sometimes I have a hard time choosing from the various mustard options) and the mixed pickles at the condiment bar, the spicy peppers in particular. I also enjoy the pulled pork sandwich, though I haven't had it here. The fries, though--they're hand-cut Belgian double-fried fries, but I can't seem to like them very much. They always come out pale yellow and unimpressive, though I do love the garlic aioli that comes on the side. Ditto the chipotle ketchup.In any case, I'm a big fan of this place. The Oinkster unites quality with ease, offering satisfying food in a very pleasant environment. I have to come back for more.	1
Kind of surprised with the negative reviews here, as I've had reliably good experiences with Smoky's. They serve very nice steaks and their prices are quite reasonable compared to your a la carte type steakhouses. A steak includes salad, soup and side all for one price. They don't exactly season the meat all that much so if you're looking for a salt crust on your sirloin then you will be disappointed, but I don't mind having to use the salt & pepper shakers a tad. You can always add salt, but there's no fixing too much of it. Besides, there's plenty of salt to be had in the hash brown, which is by far the best side dish option as long as you're not counting calories. Overall, a good option if you want a good steak with not a lot of fuss and a reasonable price compared to say, Tornado Club.	0
I love the fact that their menu is 90% gluten free, that alone deserves five stars. I came in on a Saturday around 4:30pm and it was pretty slow which was perfect since I heard it can get busy. The atmosphere is super cute, the restaurant is very small (you have to walk through the kitchen to get to the restroom- but I like seeing the kitchens!) and the service was friendly, but not in an in your face kind of way which I can appreciate. As for the food, we had chips and guacamole/salsa, crispy beef &amp; pickle tacos, lobster tacos, elote and the carne asada tacos. <br><br>-Chips &amp; Guacamole/Salsa: AMAZING!!!! The chips are fresh with the perfect amount of salt and the guacamole was delicious. The salsa was a bit spicy for me, but the taste was good.<br>-Crispy Beef Taco &amp; Pickle: Whoa! The combo might seem weird but it was SO good! The sharpness of the cheddar with the tangy pickle and the yummy beef was perfect. <br>-Lobster Taco: I was most excited to try this taco, but was slightly disappointed. The lobster is fresh and quite good, there was a little too much slaw for me and I didn&#39;t taste the crema at all, just a lot of lime. For $19 it wasn&#39;t worth it.<br>-Carne Asada Taco: DELISH! I loved the chunky avocado on this taco, it just completed the whole thing.<br>-Elote: I was let down on this one. The corn was tasteless and mushy, it didn&#39;t seem fresh at all and again, it was all lime. <br><br>Their menu is great for sharing, you get two tacos in each order. I really liked this place and despite the lobster taco and elote, I loved everything.	1
This is the worst restaurant I have ever been to. I went with 3 girlfriends and we were literally yelling at each other at the table. Something about the way the place was built makes the noise bounce back and forth, so it&#39;s very loud in there. The service was terrible. Took 20 min to get a sample of a beer then another 20 for the glass. They sent us the wrong food 2x. Lastly, the food is extremely over priced for 2 reasons: 1. Doesn&#39;t taste good and 2. Bad quality. For example, the mashed potatoes were $6 for a bowl and they were instant (from a box)!!	0
This is the kind of diner/restaurant you want to know about so you can take people there and then they think you know what your doing.. Cute waitresses, great food... AND 365 days / 24-7? Love it. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE and the Cheese balls.	1
Haven't tried the restaurant yet, but their deli sandwiches are terrific.	1
Order the 'bool dalk' and your choice of beer. Fire chicken is the literal translation of bool dalk. You can request your own level of spiciness to your comfort or for the challenge. I've tried a not-too-spicy bool dalk with cheese and it was delicious. Crank up the heat. It's deliciously on fiyaaah!	1
I came here tonight for the first time and I loved it! Everything seems so delicious and what I ordered most certainly was delicious! The vibe of this place is cool as well. I like it all and recommend the corn for sure!	1
Real cold meat-a-balls.Real cold staff, no follow up.But Monday supper!	0
The service was great, the atmosphere was great- besides that, the only thing that I truly enjoyed was the chicken in a soy broth. The oysters were not clean or fresh, the cauliflower soup had no flavor, so on and so forth. It was overpriced, definitely not worth what you are getting. I was very disappointed.	0
Only time I write reviews is when it's really good or really bad. I had zero expectation but it was super delish! We had breezy bacon Burger and curry wings. Everything was very good. This will be my top go-to place in my neighborhood.	1
Food was ok. Not great but not horrible. Had the chicken quesadilla with corn flour. Was more like tacos with cheese warmed up. My friend has the pollo adobo. It was just ok. Woman serving us was nice though. Would probably not come back to eat here.	0
Ordered from this place via EAT24, was told the delivery will take 45 min (the restaurant is about 5 min away from my place). After waiting for 1 hour and 20 min I contacted EAT24 and was told the restaurant apologizes for the delay and my food will be delivered in a few minutes. Waited. At about 2 hour mark i reached out to EAT24 again and was told that restaurant misplaced my order and that kitchen is closed already and there is nothing they can do. Thanks, My Ceviche!	0
Such a cute place with nice views and plenty of room in the patio. Make sure to take a heavy jacket for your companion ;)	1
On the pricier side of what I&#39;d call a &#34;casual&#34; dinner, and right in line with the slue of New American restaurants popping up in downtown and Silverlake and the other up and coming hip places. <br><br>I went with a gal pal of mine last night because I&#39;d heard good things about this new spot (it&#39;s new-ish, right?) and other than wishing I could get a slightly cheaper glass of wine (not over priced overall, but my unrefined palate would have appreciated more in the $7-10 range instead of the $12-17 range) I was totally satisfied with our meal. I tend to go to nicer places and stick to small plates to keep with my budget instead of going to lower-priced places in general, which was an awesome strategy here - a flatbread, a starter, and a vegetable dish were more than enough to feed the two of us. I ended up taking leftovers home! <br><br>We had the leek, stilton, and truffle oil flatbread which was definitely truffle-y; it was very good, though I think I would have preferred to stuck to my instinct and gone with the prosciutto and arugula one, just some less bold flavors there makes it more palatable in larger quantities. We also ordered the veal meatballs with romesco and yogurt mint sauce which were delicious, and the brussel sprouts with pancetta and a fried egg, a staple on winter New American menus it seems, and it didn&#39;t disappoint. I always love a good brussel and these were very well caramelized. <br><br>Wait staff was friendly, and the abmiance was hip and dark without being overly intimate - I could easily see going here for a real date night just as much as a friend-date night. And I was there for dinner, not late night, but I would imagine it&#39;s very well suited for midnight munchies! Or at least more european style 10pm dining.	1
i&#39;m sorry to say but this isn&#39;t the best Ramen Noodle i&#39;ve ever had. <br><br>First the line/wait is long <br>Second the place is small<br>3rd the food was just &#34;OKAY AVERAGE&#34; I will not wait for a freakin Ramen for one hour, it is not worth it, I rather go somewhere else that is shorter. There is this one place that is pretty good but i forgot the name of it hahha. I don&#39;t see why people will wait in the line for this long just for a freakin ramen. Its just too ridiculous and too much. <br><br>I&#39;m rating this one star because of the wait, if the wait doesn&#39;t have to be long i will rate it 5 star.	0
Our Paseo experience begins on a Monday. Dont come on a Monday, they will not be open. We try again on Tuesday, around 11:30 and there is already a line out the door. 15 minutes later we place our order and about 15 minutes after that we receive the two juiciest, messiest, most flavorful sandwiches in Seattle. Sandwiches live up to the hype, so did the wait. You decide if its worth it.	0
Ate here on my first night in Seattle and I don't know if that was a mistake or not because it set the bar pretty high. Loved the atmosphere. We sat outside on a mid-september night when the weather was perfect and clear enough to see the water and the ferries going back and forth. The food was all fantastic. We split the prosciutto plate..obviously it's hard to mess that up so no complaints there. I ordered the spaghetti bolognese and my boyfriend ordered the summer risotto. Both were fantastic and we ended up sharing everything except the wine. I like a lighter red (had the Oregon Pinot Noir) and my boyfriend likes a Cab so I loved that they had half bottles which we each ordered in our preferred varietal. I can't speak highly enough of the risotto though. It really was so perfect. It had summer corn and dungeness crab. The flavor was so so good and I'm still dreaming about it. Also had the Carmel Budino for dessert and I have to say it was quite sweet but it really was deicious. My boyfriend was obsessed. Oh yeah, and the outdoor tablecloths were so cute...I just loved that touch.	1
WTF happened to this place?? Why did they get rid of galbi and banchan??? Why the fawk are they bringing some random tacos and ramen now???!!!! Who made this dumb change? Also- why are the servers so damn unhappy with their lives? They're so pist off and annoyed all the time. Goodbye KogiKing. I used to love you but now I'm never coming back.	0
It&#39;s mothers day and we head for a quick bite cuz I don&#39;t want to cook. We opt for Cuban food as we don&#39;t want to wait eternities else where. This place did not have a waiting line so we tried it out. We get the croqueta preparada, pan con bistec and steak with Moro. The usual garlic bread was provided with our drinks. The food was average, not something I would go out of my way for. Now, service was horrible... Our server/ waitress disappeared into thin air... No water/ soda refills and we had to get ketchup from a nearby table! And the placed was not even packed! Now I know why.... I&#39;m not coming back...	0
It&#39;s going to be really hard to write this review, the rating is not because of the food or drinks, those were really good. But I do appreciate when a good manager keeps the staff in checked.<br><br>When we got there we were told that the pitcher of sangria was $10 in happy hour. We order 2 pitchers before 7pm, among several plates. When it was time to pay the bill, our surprise was seeing the pitchers at full price. And when I asked about it the waiter tells me that the one at that price is the half pitcher. At this point all I wanted to do is talk to the manager, and the waiter in a very rude manner approached us, and claiming that it was a misunderstanding and miscommunication grabbed the bill (which was handwritten) and tore it right there in front of us. As I see things, if it was a mistake (totally posible) I would have fix the pitcher value as a way to say sorry and let the customer pay the bill. At this point with no bill I couldn&#39;t pay it, couldn&#39;t talk to the manager and no tip for the waiter of course after that behavior.<br><br>It seems very dubious to me and my friends that this guys destroyed the bill without trying to come up with another solution and talk about it. I consider myself a very understanding costumer but I don&#39;t answer good to rudeness and when I feel some type of dishonesty is happening I can&#39;t let it go.<br>Hopefully this was a one person thing and I had bad luck.	0
Definitely a great meal of steak and frites for dineLA but I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d pay $25 per person for this on the regular.<br><br>The restaurant is very, very pretty. It&#39;s classy and perfect for a date if you are a classy person. The couple next to us was actually on a birthday date. They some classy folk cuz for my birthday I ate chips in the car while driving my boyfriend to my &#34;surprise&#34;...yeah, he has his license, he just doesn&#39;t like to drive -___-<br><br>Anyway! L&#39;Assiette is really nice, and the dineLA dinner was one of my favorites. YOU HAVE TO GET THE SOUP TO START!!!! please! Like the name &#34;sorrel herb soup&#34; sounded to my uncultured ears like some plain old brothy vegetable soup, but no! It&#39;s creamy and delicious and sort of like a smooth vegetable chowder...I don&#39;t know, it was definitely a great surprise because I wasn&#39;t expecting much from the appetizers. The salad is fine, I guess, but you can have the same old balsamic vinaigrette salad ANYWHERE, but not that tasty soup :)<br><br>The steak and frites entree was delicious. The fries cooked in beef tallow were so delicious and crispy, and the gravy/sauce that the beef was cooked in made the meal. We asked for extra sauce to dip our fries in because we lack both class and shame, and it was worth it! GET EXTRA SAUCE!!<br><br>The downside of the meal: So since we get 2 courses of each entree, my boyfriend and I got the steak and frites, and then we decided why not, let&#39;s try the portobello mushroom with vegetarian fries. Oh no. DO NOT GET THE VEGETARIAN PEANUT OIL FRIES. WOAHHHHH they were so soggy and undercooked, ew. EVERY single fry was mushy and bent, like it was to the point where if you held one up, it would not be straight because it was just undercooked. I was super disappointed here, because DUDE, you are a steak and frites restaurant, what&#39;s going on with these frites? Like it&#39;s not like fries cooked in oil have to be shitty....EVERYWHERE else cooks fries in vegetable oil and they can make it crispy! Why can&#39;t you??<br><br>So, I asked them to please make the peanut oil fries crispier for the second course. They said, &#34;Of course!&#34; but they didn&#39;t, it was just as disappointing the second time around :(<br><br>But not all is lost! Because the medium rare steak was beautiful and tender, and the desserts were great as well. I really liked the amaretto cake because it was so moist and it was served on a plate of delicious cream. The fudge brownie was not as dense or moist as I would have liked :( It was kinda dry and cake-y. The rose macaron they served with it was disgusting....I just hate floral flavors. It&#39;s upsetting to me. I don&#39;t enjoy eating soap. My soaps mostly smell like food also. I just, no.<br><br>Overall, I had a good time! haha sorry for my UP and down writing, somethings were good and some were bad and I tend to get caught up in the emotion, but it was definitely a good experience! I left L&#39;Assiette with a comfortable feeling in my stomach, a couple of extra inches around my waist, and a smile on my face :)	1
Considering how busy the Bazaar was when I visited the stall, service was so quick, and staff were very friendly and efficient. I had the Super Frite with curry ketchup and they were absolutely to die for. I&#39;ve tried French fries at plenty of places around the city, but these were easily some of the best I&#39;ve ever had. Hot, crispy, perfectly salted, and freshly prepared. Couldn&#39;t ask for anything better.	1
Delicious a bit pricey but you get lots of food 	1
Broth was great, but I&#39;ve had better noodles. They were hard and not chewy enough.	0
Was excited to try this place because of all the great yelp reviews. My G. Friend and I Have been eating K. BBQ for years now, so we where not new to the food or environment. Sadly , food was tasty and good going in, but we both had major stomach issues all that night and the next day. Needless to say, we will not be returning. Not a great Saturday date night experiance.	0
Just WOW. The food here is HORRIBLE. The service is horrendous. Save your money and your health. The sandwiches here are overpriced and filled with bad ingredients. The quality of the meat is old and dry, doesn't even smell like meat. One time I got more fat than meat in my sandwich. The bread is always soggy. The last time I ordered my food came with peanuts on it!!! I specifically told them I was allergic!!! This is due to their extreme negligence for their customers because they don't care. The soups here are nasty also and super over priced!! Don't touch this place you will regret it. Also they take over an HOUR to deliver food 5 minutes away!!!	0
Went for a weekend lunch for my first trip. Nice beer selection, but a bit pricey relative to other local prices. E.g., $7 for a pint of beer that would go for $5-6 at other comparable establishments like Alchemy or Brasserie V. I would expect that in Chicago but not Madison.	0
We stumbled on this place while looking for somewhere to sit down and enjoy a drink and a bite to eat (No easy feat in Williamsburg on a rainy Friday night) and we&#39;re so glad we did! It was just the right level of busy, a buzz but a couple of free tables. The cocktails ($10 each) were delicious, and the italian influenced food was awesome - the porchetta in particular. Perfect for a date, we&#39;ll be back!	1
Great place to go for a drink in the evening. Stopped in on Halloween eve, and it was rather empty. Went to the bar, ordered drinks, and sat down on one of the chairs outside. Was warmish thanks to the patio heaters they have spread out all around the tables. The view was nice, kinda makes you feel like you're out of the city. Someone mentioned loud music, and I personally liked that as it removed ambient noise from the outside which made it feel even more like "getting away".I live down the block, so I will probably be checking out this spot for a little while, until it starts to get more popular... and most probably harder to get into (or a table).Staff was on par, always there to fill water and ask if we were fine. Maybe a bit "over-staffed" that particular night? Who knows, lots of servers/waitresses running around. There is also a fire pit further down (past the pool), did not make it down there. But it looked like a good place to warm up these cold nights.We did not order much food, just a desert and some fries, both were good. May come back here for dinner and update. I was really impressed with this spot, and recommend checking it out if you're in the area. This side of town isn't the hottest spot, but like many other people are saying, Wilshire is up-and-coming. So who knows, may be a hot spot very soon.Just one note... there are only two bathrooms upstairs on the rooftop. One stall for men, and one for women. The bathroom is nicely designed, but the sinks are damn tiny. I can see there be a waiting line for the bathrooms, unless there are some directly downstairs for customers to use (non-guests).Will be back...	1
PRO: Great Beer. CONS:Pushy service. I felt as if I did not order something else the server was going to hit me. TOO MUCH SALT! I definitely like salt, but the cured fish plate seemed like they A) forgot to wash the curing salts off the fish B) spilled the salt all over the chip the salmon was served on. The fries and fish plates together were so salty that it ruined the best part of the meal which was the beer. After the two plates I was still hungry for more food, but decided that my date and I would get a main course and dessert elsewhere.I really wanted to love this place and I could write a much more witty and well documented version of my accounts, but my mouth is still dry from the salt and I need to get up and grab a glass of water.	0
A very welcome addition to the neighborhood! This is a very comfortable, friendly and affordable bistro that leans in a decidedly Mediterranean direction (fresh fish, lamb - served as koffte kebabs or as a tender and generous lamb shank) while still serving the expected staples of roast chicken, hamburgers, et al. Everything I sampled was carefully prepared, fresh as could be, and served with sincere warmth and hospitality. What a pleasure.	1
What a disappointment. The service was uneven, the drinks weak, but expensive and the food had no flavor. We ordered my son macaroni and cheese, which included Tillamook diner cheese- not soulful at all. He didn't even finish it. The best thing on the table was the glass of malbec they pour. To be honest, I don't even recall what I ordered, the food was so forgetful. I won't be back.	0
2 Stars.. We came here last night after watching Beck and Jenny Lewis play at Club Nokia.. I have past by this cafe so many times in the past and I have always wanted to try it out.. Alas we did and I was not impressed at all.. <br><br>The wait was long and I was a little hungry for I had skipped dinner and had not eaten since lunch.. Some twelve hours earlier. So, finally we are seated. Miguel was our server and he was on top of it. He alone gets 5 stars. <br><br>The menu is pretty simple. You look on the wall and that&#39;s it. I ordered the scrambled eggs meal and coffee.. The bread that comes out before your meal was great.... BUT MY EGGS.. YUCK...... Overly greasy and seriously if you are taking ALLI I would recommend not taking it if you come here. You seriously will have an explosive mess... This really is a greasy dive sort of a place.... If you give two fucks about your figure then just know that this is not for you. My eggs were soaked in grease. I couldn&#39;t eat them.... <br><br>On a positive note... This place certainly has it&#39;s history and it&#39;s charm. It&#39;s been open for 88 years now... I wonder how many clogged arteries has this place given now... Any-hoot I tried it and I won&#39;t be back..<br><br>OH.. AND FOR THE CRAP THAT WE ATE CAME OUT OT BE A TOTAL OF $35 AND SOME CHANGE.... Over priced for crap I think...<br><br>Fin	0
Dear Paseo,	1
I really like this place, I&#39;ve had lunch here twice. I judge a Mexican restaurant by their salsa and the salsa here is great. Service was great and the decor is cute. I highly recommend this place	1
a ramen restaurant in seattle that is worth it. the shio broth is just as creamy as you'll find at the BC location - this is my dream ramen. it's incredibly rich. so worth it. glad it's finally in my backyard.	1
My husband and I gave it a shot yesterday and it is nothing special. I ordered the Homeskillet hamburger cooked well done. The menu explains that it comes with American Cheese. When it came out it did not have cheese so I took it back up. The girl said, "Oh, what kind of cheese did you want?" Well your menu says American so I am pretty sure that is what I wanted. Then I got 1/2 way through my burger and it was completely pink. Turns out that they cooked my husband's hamburger well done. I will not be back and wish I could get my $23 back.	0
This place is amazing. I've never been to a restaurant for breakfast on a weekday that was so packed, and I know why. Monday through Friday dishes are discounted! My friend had the bananas foster pancakes-they were unbelievable. I had the spicy shrimp with creamy grits and eggs (poached)-they were the best grits I've ever eaten. The cocktails were fantastic and the restaurant was beautiful! When I go back go Seattle, I WILL be going back.	0
Very yummy burgers. . they are not that large in size, but they fill you up. . the patty is thick. I had the truffle burger, DELICIOUS. the sweet potato fries were good too!!	1
It&#39;s so close to my place that we end up there fairly often. The foot is great, for the most part. Tried a few things that&#39;ve been duds, but the winners are as follows:<br><br>Mac &amp; cheese: Outstanding. Baked. Get it with ham &amp; broccoli. So good.<br>Hawaiian tuna poke with wonton chips: Awesome, and this is coming from someone who is not that down with sushi. <br>Blue crab hush puppies: Outstanding as well. Almost too much breading, but let&#39;s be frank, does such a thing exist? Negative ghost rider, the pattern is full.<br>Caesar salad: was outstanding because it was spicy, but they&#39;ve changed it. It is still good, just not as good as before.<br>El camarone pizza: Awesome, brings a lot of great tastes together into one happy-happy pizza.<br>Tasty burger: God DAMN this is good. The beef is amazing.<br>Flat iron steak: My favorite thing here. Steak is always great tasting, the green stuff they put on top is so good (god knows what it is...).<br><br>The only thing that keeps me from a five star review is the ambience on the place. <br><br>First off, and everyone who has been there knows this, it is just too damned dark. I understand you are trying to create a &#34;mood&#34; here folks, but your crappy orange candles are not sufficient light for me to read your menu. I have to literally bring it to within 2-3 inches of my face sometimes. Annoying. <br><br>The music. I know you can&#39;t please everyone, and lord knows you won&#39;t please me, but please refrain from EVER playing that shitty house music that sometimes comes on. I don&#39;t want to eat while I feel like I&#39;m in The Matrix. And the volume is always just 2 or 3dB too loud. I don&#39;t like having to raise my voice halfway to a shout to talk to my friends. And no, I&#39;m not old. F you!<br><br>The last thing they need to get rid of is the crappy new school art on the walls. New school has it&#39;s place, and that for me is usually graffitied onto buildings and overpasses. Not the walls of your restaurant. Change it please, kthxbai.	1
why is this place so expensive??? why must i pay for chips and salsa?? what has california mexican cuisine come to? i don't understand!! I don't think "good" mexican food can be categorized by how much you're paying for it...if so, this place would be the bees knees! but, I've had better.save a trip -- go to leo's on venice and la brea! $1 a taco!	0
we had a great time. the show and presentation of food is great. nothing else like it! our server was fantastic. he was bubbly, friendly and super accommodating. The food is good... not the best in LA but good. I would recommend going for special occasions.	1
We went earlier this year, the food wasn&#39;t very good. We ordered xiao long bao and shrimp with walnuts. I didn&#39;t like the soup in the buns, it tasted a little off. The shrimp was greasy and rubbery, the worst I&#39;ve ever had. To top it off, service was extremely slow for a completely empty restaurant.	0
This is hands down the BEST Thai Food I've ever had in my life. I could eat this every day. Every item I ordered was exquisite. 10 out of 10.	1
After i bought a pitcher of beer, the hostess made me leave my spot and the bar because they had people wanting to eat dinner. Im sorry but, everyone in my party ordered dinner, just because i just ordered alcohol and not food, doesnt make me a lesser person, i should not have to leave your mediocre italian meatball place because of something like this. But whatever its fine, (just talk to your staff in LES, and help them treat people better)	0
great sandwiches. on wood.	1
Order off the authentic menu.	1
THE MOO IS AWESOME. moooooooooo :Danyways tried the sampler today, i think it was AMAZING.eventhough the chicken strips looked like it had zits on it it was amzing especially with the honey mustard sauce. perfect combination.honey chicken was not super sweet like other places so its definitely a plus cause i can still taste the chicken unlike other places where it would seem as if its honey on bone.moooooooooo :Dcustomer service is on point, im a server so im highly critical about service. :D	1
We didn't get to eat. The cigar smell is so overpowering that we turned right around. We were going to try the patio but the cigar smell from inside is so strong that we couldn't take that either. Too bad as we were excited to discover nearby Cuban food.	0
Luna Park did a bang-up job for my birthday. Worked with me to create a menu, accommodated a large party without a snag, provided great service during the actual party, offered a range of nice cocktails -- and, oh yea, the food was great!This place has a nice vibe, great food, and excellent staff -- three cheers!NB: Their wine list is fairly priced and well chosen.	1
The manager here was super nice and super helpful along with the servers.. The manager Ashley was so nice! We ordered the Tempura Onion rings, truffled fries, original burger and pastrami mami burger.. Everything was very delicious. Our onion rings came out really late but Ashley not only took the onion rings off of our bill but also bought us a Bloody Mary! Kalynda was our server and she was also nice and helpful, she never left our side! Thank you umami burger! You guys are the shiizzzz	1
OK, OK, OK, Johny formerly of Pucci&#39;s and Little Louie&#39;s, has gone solo! It seems like I would follow this man anywhere, to experience his cooking. This New York transplant who really know how to spin a pizza, finally has his very own location and the menu is huge! Pizza superb, lasagna divine, great garlic rolls, etc., all served with a unique sense of humor! Johny has a customer service personality that can&#39;t be beat! One visit and you will be hooked! Give this real Italian Chief a try...	1
Not all it&#39;s cracked up to be. It is fun, I will give it that. I gave a few tries but now I&#39;m over it and prob not going back anytime soon.	0
Awesome hot dog stand in the middle of down town. If you are down town jumping from one joint to another this is a great spot to get a cheap snack if you&#39;re hungry? My favorite topping was definitely the crumbled potato chips.. Absolutely genius, who knew adding potato chips to a hot dog could add so much texture/crunch, flavor and all that jazz. The guy working the stand is pretty quick and friendly. Although I was a fan, Ryan M. was not but maybe that&#39;s because he&#39;s from Jersey?	1
Came here for brunch, got a strawberry, banana and nutella crepe. It was amazing! They had other stuff, both sweet and savory. Coffee was really good too. Service was e excellent, very friendly. They have a great neighborhood vibe. It was also really nice we didn&#39;t have to wait in a line for a hour and half to eat. Prices were great too!	1
The Zig Zag really has the BEST cocktails...went there with some friends and we all loved the specialty cocktails we chose. The atmosphere is fun too. Food was just average but that was okay this is a special and fun place.	1
I love this place. Their food &amp; coffee is awesome.<br><br>Would have given the place 5 stars if not for a couple things.<br>1. They need to get fly nets for the baked goods. People don&#39;t want to buy pastries after a fly has landed on it. Yuck.<br>2. I&#39;ve witnessed some unclean practices by a certain male employee. Namely, he put his fingers in a to go order he packaged for me. A day later, I saw his push down garbage in a garbage can with a rag he used to wipe down the counters with. <br><br>I hope management takes these mistakes seriously, it&#39;s just plain gross.	1
Craving pizza, wraps, chicken wings, and chocolate chip cookies, but worried about the fat? Worry no more- Power Pizza is the place for you! <br><br>Delicious pizzas with low-fat toppings and extra protein in the crust. <br><br>A large selection of yummy wraps, some come hot, some come cold, but all good! I especially recommend the chicken bacon ranch wrap or the spinach wrap (just had one now for lunch and it was so YUMMY--chicken, spinach, walnuts, red onion, bleu cheese and their own vinaigrette!). <br><br>Chicken Wings here are fantastic too! They are completely baked so no worries ab the oil vat fat! <br><br>Chocolate chip cookies are INSANELY good here. Truth be told, I am not 100% sure they aren&#39;t fattening, but I don&#39;t care! lol. They remind me a little of David&#39;s Cookies from back in the day inside the Dadeland Burdines, but I digress.... <br><br>They also have very good salads and I have heard good things about their Strombolis...haven&#39;t had a Stromboli there though...yet! <br><br>This is definitely the place to be if you want to eat &#34;fatty food&#34; and not feel as if you have to run 10 miles after!	1
I love this place. The attmosphere is a fun laid back restaurant. I always get the smores when I come here for dessert. Here is a rating of what I've had: Cheese Fondue: 8/10Hushpuppies: 6/10Margaritta Pizza: 7/10Mushroom Pizza: 7/10Your a Pepper Drink: 10/10Smores: 10/10Great attmosphere here. Some people come dressed up, some dont, and nobody cares. Love that kind of vibe.	1
Yumm! Whenever I&#39;m in the area you can find me eating lunch here. Chefs Kitchen is great for lunch and dinner Mon-Fri and they cater events and party&#39;s on weekends. This is a family owned business and Chef Hector is very talented. He studied at the Culinary Institute of America in New York and he is always in the know about all the best restaurants. I am never disappointed with his food. The menu changes everyday so you will never get bored eating there everyday. I usually substitute the regular vegi medley and mashed potatoes for his sauteed spinach and scalloped potatoes. If you like salad the Asian salad is wonderful. I find myself getting the chicken special or the fish. I love the way he prepares sea bass. Oh and his Chicken with roasted pears and Gorgonzola is to die for!	1
I liked the whole feel of the bar, came the 2nd night they were open which was a Saturday and it was pretty empty.They played indie-type music and it felt like one was in a big log cabin.I want to come back to try their food especially the Belgian waffles/fries.	1
sigh. i wanted to love this place. the two stars is mostly for the ambiance which is great. i really love the oaks gourmet and was hoping the same quality would be replicated here. the menu is ambitious, full of things that you should not have on the menu unless you are really going to nail them (i.e. po boys and philly cheese steaks) but they don't nail them, so them menu ends up being a hodge podge of poorly executed dishes. to top is all off the servers here are clueless. they don't know anything about the menu and can't steer you around it at all, whether it's food or beer or anything else. also, we were in there when it wasn't that busy and our server was looking around the place like she was slammed when there were other servers on the floor and plenty of bussers helping out. and why are you a pub with a bbq menu? just don't do a bbq menu unless it is going to be truly amazing bbq. they are just trying to do too many things here and doing none of them well.	0
I've been to LA Cafe dozens of times. They never fail to underwhelm me with their food. I go back again and again because of the location and the fact that they have alfresco seating. I love watching people go by and hanging out on the fake grass.But literally everything I've ever had has been mediocre.Get the food quality together guys. Mealy tomatoes, cold soup, and slow service? Get out of here. I could carry on about it for awhile, but this place is borderline 0-1 star material. I'm not coming back unless it's the middle of the night and I'm starving.	0
Food was GREAT. Service was GREAT. Value was GREAT. Portions were HUGE. What else can you say? It was the PERFECT place to stop for a GREAT meal in Chinatown. The reviews were not wrong. Stop by and you will be glad you did.	1
Fuel is everything a neighborhood coffee shop should be and it's in a great spot. The people who work there are all great and I've always felt right at home. Try the vegan brownies.	1
Good and fast, pricy though.<br>Came in for something small, just ordered a grilled cheese with bacon. I wanted the bacon inside, but the waiter thought I just wanted a side of it. Whatever, I just opened up my grilled cheese and put it inside. I sat at the bar so I was able to watch the cook, he was super fast, but had already made bacon sitting underneath the grill. He made my grilled cheese with only 4 slices and then I got served the sitting bacon. I asked the waiter how long that had been sitting out for; he said he didn&#39;t know, so I asked for some fresh bacon. He asked, &#34;you want fresh?,&#34; which was confusing yet slightly humorous.... Yes, bacon is awesome, but it&#39;s even awesomer fresh!! Super excited they serve breakfast all day, but bacon &amp; eggs with potatoes and toast will run you about $10. My grilled cheese and side of bacon ran to $7.85, as I also just had water. The most expensive item on the menu (which just hangs from the wall) looks to be the T-bone steak for $28.50. It&#39;s open 24 hours and is cash only.	1
Service was pleasant, but the food, drinks, atmosphere and music were sorely disappointing. Would not recommend this restaurant.	0
I love this place everytime I order from here I get great service and a quick delivery! I would recommend their lobster grilled cheese and their chili cheese fries oh and their chocolate banana shake. Not really a fan of their falafel wrap though	1
This place is trying to be all hip and aid back with it's big picnic-style tables, no-frills margaritas in tumblers, and authentic street tacos, but really Petty Cash... you fancy. Fancy, in a good way.The food is bomb-from the guac and chips, to the fish taco to the crispy brussels sprouts-it's like gourmet street food and I wanted to try it all. One of my friend is a vegetarian and she found plenty of good stuff on the menu to eat.(I highly recommend making a reservation because this place is busy).	1
These people are extremely rude! Yes you man be bz but you must learn that being respectful to your guest esp when they are calling to ask if you are open on Xmas day that you should take a moment to speak to them with manners! I will never give you my business and will tell everyone I know in Vegas ( which is A LOT of people) to NOT GIVE U BUSINESS!	0
Mac Daddy Cheese balls... Mac Daddy Cheese balls... Mac Daddy Cheese balls... Mac Daddy Cheese balls!!!! Sooooo... on that note, TRY THEM!!!!! :) I've only been to this place late at night with a group of four or more and the service has always been great. It's a cool place nothing crazy or fancy nor sketchy, very comfy diner. Maybe a bit too comfy? The seating really sucks here it's a bunch of booths for "four people" it's really seating for two, the seating is my only complaint but other than that it's a cool spot.... Oh WAIT! PARKING!!! There is NEVER parking by this place but I guess it's on a main street and it's expected, I'm used to it.... So here are some of the dishes I/we have had... -Mac Daddy Cheese balls!!!!!!!!!!!!!! In love with them.... Lol -Mr. Freanchy also a fav in the group... very good -Mimosas - don't judge me.... lol -The B.L.T.L.A - life time favorite of mine ;) -The tower of Power... kinda like a BLT but huge! -French dip sandwich That's just some... try them or not... but go!!!!!	1
New favorite pizza in the neighborhood. Thin, crispy and long brick oven Roma style pizza - full pie 8&#34; x 40&#34; approximately is $17, margarita is $10. $2.75 slice. The service is friendly and the pizza is great. Tried the fresh mozzarella Roma, pepperoni, and zucchini-fresh tomato-artichoke pizza. Excellent! Pasta too!<br>Traditional Italian dishes.<br>No credit card yet the just opened<br>They plan on getting their beer and wine license too.<br>Menus are being printed but I added a caulk board shot.	1
My wife and I have dined at Andre's over 50 times in the past two years, why?   Marc and his staff always exceed our expectations on service and food quality.  I always joke with Marc that we're going to keep coming back until they get it right.  Well, this past Saturday, as we shared with Marc and the executive chef, Cris...they got it right.  What a wonderful meal and dinning experience.   The only problem now is, we have to keep coming back to see if they can top it...and I'm betting they will.   We also have dined at over 30 of the best restaurants in Las Vegas during the same time period (some more then once) and while there are many good ones, Andre's is the best.   You can't go wrong with the food &amp; customer treatment.  Terry &amp; Kathy	1
This place is excellent! Went with my husband and Mom the other night and we were all blown away by the food. My mom and husband ordered the BimBimBap - one with the spicy pork and one with beef. They were fresh, enormous and delicious - for only $8! Easily enough for two people to share. I got sushi and tried the TTT roll, the Spicy Tuna and the Salmon Spring Medley rolls. All three were incredibly fresh, light and the fish was excellent quality. We will absolutely be going back and will be telling everyone we know to try it!	1
I first ate a Malatesta years ago and just tried going back for a friend&#39;s birthday dinner. I don&#39;t know why this place is so busy. Yes, the atmosphere is cozy, but everything is so rushed that the food that comes out is nothing more than slop. We ordered 2 pastas and they were served within maybe 3 minutes of ordering. I understand that ragu is not going to be cooked to order, but it just felt like it was an attempt to close our table and seat the next party. It wasn&#39;t just the speed with which they came out, but it was the complete and utter lack of flavor. We actually started with the mushroom salad special and it tasted like nothing. There was absolutely no seasoning, and I&#39;m a person who always complains things are too salty. Likewise with the pasta. Between the gnocchi with tomato sauce and the ragu, there wasn&#39;t much difference. It was red. The fresh basil was the only thing that had any flavor. Even the grated cheese couldn&#39;t make up for the lack of seasoning in the dishes. We fared a little better with the main dish, the chicken cutlet. There are better Italian places in this area. Don&#39;t believe the hype!	0
Went here last with my boyfriend. The food was good. I had the Sate dinner and I really enjoyed it. My boyfriend has always said he&#39;s not a fan of Thai food but he said he really liked his food last night. The restaurant itself looks a little torn up and outdated. When we walked in nobody greeted us and I had to go up to somebody to ask for service but at least the staff was very friendly.	1
Try the: Katie Mae	1
What a great place for brunch and a wonderful menu selection. Southern brunch was on point with chicken and waffles that were amazing. Biscuits and gravy were as true to what I've had in SC on several visits there. Always make reservations as they are quite busy for brunch and I am sure for dinner as well.I'll return soon to try something different as the menu made it so hard to decide and that is a good thing.	0
My Mother and I had hamburgers and they were very, very greasy, as well as the fries.  The atmosphere looks much better in the pictures on their website then the actual place.  Looks like a run down coffee shop.  Will not go back.	0
I went to Beco on a regular basis and enjoyed the food/atmosphere until the bartender (curly hair works on weekends) mistook me for some another black women that had run out on her bill. After accosting me in front of the entire restaurant I paid the bill and left. What&#39;s insane is that the bill I supposedly ran out on was 17$! First let me say that I am black, and I also do not steal and we do not all look alike. I urge anyone/everyone to not frequent this place.	0
Just went there for the first time... good food... good anbiance... my kids loved it.<br><br>Thumbs up.<br><br>#showsometoes	1
music you can actually dance to! :)	1
Kyo Chon is close, tastes good, wings are spicy and its a great quickbite option in the neighborhood. What more do ya need?	1
I drive past The Counter Burger in Burbank all the time. I went to LACMA and there is one right across the street. Friend and I went to have lunch. I ordered a standard 1/3 lb ground beef burger on a pretzel bun and it was really good. Meat was nice and thick, pretzel bun was different and complimented the burger. Ordered the 50/50 fries (half sweet potato, half regular skinny fries). Enough for me and my friend to share. My friend ordered the chicken sandwich on a multi grain bun and he really liked it.I would definitely come back here and try other things on their menu. Overall, I was very satisfied.	1
Wasn&#39;t really stoked on this place. My boyfriend took me for our anniversary for the desert/champagne portion of the evening. <br><br>Champagne selection was very meh for a restaurant listed as $$$. It was like Freixnet and stuff- that was actually their nicest option. Desert was good but our server abandoned us after he realized we only ordered desert and champs. <br><br>Someone else dropped our desert (we had to flag someone down for a fork if I remember right) and never reappeared until our drinks and plates were empty, then he just dropped the check without a word and walked off (I was about to order another glass). <br><br>The manager seemed very courteous though. That was about it.	0
Grade: C+. Solid, but Overrated by Seattleites. Having lived in the Carribbean for multiple years and eating Cuban Sandwiches (aka: el Cubano) made by Cuban immigrants, this place is decidedly average at best. Let's be clear here: the sandwiches are not Carribbean or Cuban (would be an insult to call them as such). They are Americanized versions. The Grilled Pork and Carribbean Roast are must haves without question, though the pork is not truly succulent/moist/falling apart. The aioli (garlic mayo/olive oil) spread is flavorful and unique and the version of the sandwich here is a great Westernized take. However, as more of a traditionalist here, the four chief complaints would be that the sandwich does not use Cuban bread, it does not have the necessary cheese, does not use the real sauce combination (the aioli is good, but where is the mustard/mayo/ketchup mix), and lastly, it is not pressed and crispy.The cheese is necessary because it melts into the meat and bread. The cilantro, lettuce and caramelized onions are all Western additions. I've chatted and spoken with the staff on numerous occassions - they are great, friendly and nearly all have roots back to Mexico (not Cuba). A great addition to add would be to have fruit shakes (Batida de Lechosa, Mango, Pina, etc.) in the similar fashion with milk/condensed milk and fresh fruit. Judged solely on the merits of sandwich taste, I would argue that Tat's Deli has a better/tastier offering and that Hole-in-the-wall colmados in NYC/Boston/RI make better authentic sandwiches.	1
I was planning a surprise birthday party for a group of 20-25 people, so I called ahead to see if they took reservations (they don&#39;t). Since they don&#39;t take reservations and seating was on a first come first serve basis, the manager told me to rest assure that there would be seats available since the place is two stories. He was correecttooo!! .. There was plenty of seating upstairs, so our whole group was able to be together! Yayy!! Since we had such a huge party, the staff members were nice enough to bring the iPad upstairs and take all our orders individually! The amazing service doesn&#39;t just stop there! They gave us quite a few complementary tator tots w/ eggs since we had such a huge party! AND they brought all of our food upstairs! Whoever served us that night, THANK YOU. you were amazing! <br><br>The food was DELICIOUS!! The taco man would be proud. I had the steal flank taco and the tater tots with egg! The tator tots is a must try!!!! They also have this delicious hot sauce that I just can&#39;t get enough of! The red velvet cake was so-so. A little too sweet for my taste, but worth trying.	1
Probably one of my favorite spots in DTLA, and a staple for taking friends from out of town. Classy but relaxed rooftop lounge with food (get the pork belly, truffle poutine, &amp; squash gnocchi) and cocktails that are on point. If you dislike crowds, go during a weekday or make a reservation and skip the complaints. Perch is one of those well-rounded spots that&#39;s great for dates or going out with friends...or one of those nights where you feel like pretending you&#39;re at a NYC rooftop bar in summer.	1
This was a great addition to the burger joints around LA. It added something a little different with its uniquely stuffed burgers and creative salad bar. The Special sauce was great and had a very refreshing taste, a surprise to see in the world of Garlic Aioli and Chipotle Mayo dips. It&#39;s definitely worth the trip out to Fashion District, located in the International Food Court behind the McDonalds. Very good eating.	1
I've been here many times before and had great service, but all good things come to an end.Came around 8 on a Friday night, hostess was nice and seated us right away. That's where the service ended. Ignored by the waiters for over 20 minutes. Everyone walked by and looked at us, but no one stopped. The restaurant was half empty (I can see why) so there was no excuse. When we finally walked out, the hostess just smile and said "Have a great night" in the most sarcastic tone, like it was common place for people to get up and walk out.Luna Park, you've lost a customer, but if you're anything like your service, you probably don't care.	0
Whenever I am in the area, which isn&#39;t often, I stop by Canter&#39;s to grab a corned beef sandwich. It&#39;s the only thing I&#39;ve ever eaten there, so I can&#39;t comment on the rest of their food. The corned beef sandwich is incredible! It&#39;s so big I can barely put it in my mouth. It&#39;s cut super thin and is very moist. I usually put a little bit of mustard on it, but nothing else. <br><br>I sometimes get a side of cole slaw or potato salad depending on my mood. Both are excellent, but these two items could be hit and miss with some people since everyone has their own idea of what these should taste like. They also bring out a side dish of pickles, which are some of the best I have ever had.<br><br>The service has always been great for me. They have a unusual mix of servers here too - from what looks like college students to the very elderly. But even the geriatrics can hustle pretty good.<br><br>The decor here seems to be locked in the 50s or some other time period. Just not anything recent. You know they don&#39;t put all of their money back in to decorating the place. Even though it appears to be old here, it is very clean and makes you feel very comfortable hanging out here.<br><br>I didn&#39;t give Canter&#39;s a 5-star rating because they have raised there prices a lot over the last few years and it is getting ridiculous.	1
I am very sad to report a bad experience at PT. The last couple times I have felt like things are going downhill here but last weekend may be the last time I visit. <br><br>One happy surprise before the bad news. PT has this amazing garden! It is huge and beautifully dimly lit. <br><br>The food was the problem - I do hate to say it. We have a few menu favorites so we ordered those - the lobster special &amp; the tagliatelle with peas and ham. There was also a short rib special so I jumped on that one as well! The lobster was always the BF&#39;s favorite. It was served in a spicy sauce with pasta. YUM. Now they are making it with a regular tomato sauce that was watery and completely flavorless. :( My fav pasta was also a bit below par.. The plate seemed smaller than usual. The short ribs were the worst. I LOVE cooking braised short ribs so I was excited about it but then soooo disappointed. I would say they needed an extra hour cooking. Don&#39;t get me wrong, they were cooked just they didn&#39;t fall off the bone. I had to pick it up with my hands and attempt to knaw it off the bone.... My friend was so grossed out by the extra fat that hadn&#39;t cooked away yet she couldn&#39;t even eat it. <br><br>Oh well, PT was good while it lasted. It is a bummer though because this was one of the few spots I frequented!	0
It was a hot dry day and we had been spending a ton of time walking along Hollywood Blvd, getting pictures of the walk of fame celebs (literally hours) and we got very hungry and very VERY thirsty. Being a big Mexican food lover, I could eat it everyday and never tire of it, I wanted to stop here. I'm SO glad we did! The service was wonderful, the food was great (we got the chicken quesadillas) and they even sell bottled Coca-cola. How cool is that?! Being from Atlanta, bottled Coke is a serious culture there. All in all I cannot recommend it highly enough.	1
I placed my order at 11:12 am. Upon placing my order on your online ordering site, it never told me a pick time or told me to check my email for a time. Just said &#34;thank you for placing your order&#34;. Also, People who came in several minutes after me and ordered on the spot got their food before someone who ordered in advanced? Makes no sense for it to work that way. When I got there the place was pretty busy, but by the time I left It was close to empty and yet I&#39;m the only one still sitting around waiting for food. Food was just okay too, and over priced. Didn&#39;t care for the wrap I got. Won&#39;t ever be back. It&#39;s too bad, cause I work near by and been wanting to try this place for months. But Now I see I am not missing out on that much, in my opinion.	0
These could reallllllly be addictive. The honey is delicious and the spicy is spicy (and I'm Jamaican and eat Jerk chicken on the regular) but soooo good. Great hangout drinking some beer food. Love this place!!	1
I have wanted to try this restaurant since they opened, and was not really impressed. The food was good as expected, small portions but tasty- but nothing I would really go back for. its being done in so many other restaurants. What really stood our to me was the service. Our waitress was pleasant but not really interested ; every single interaction with the manager, busser and food runner lack any form of engaging service. Don't get me wrong, I don't wanna hear your life story- but a smile would not hurt! The hype definitely follows this restaurant around.	0
This is a fantastic place! I&#39;ve been there for wine and cheese tasting before and everything was beyond delish! I have also been hooked on their omelets. The space is a bit narrow so i would not recommend it for crowds. It&#39;s really enough for a 2 people dining experience.	1
Not much to say that hasn't been said before but I really do like this place! We'll stop in for dinner and a drink (or two) before walking down to the Arclight and then walk back to finish our evening with another drink (or two...or three). Service has always been friendly and efficient. Not always the fastest but I've never seen the bottom of my glass before asking if I want another so that counts for something right there! For food I've enjoyed everything from a burger to a salad to the short ribs and it's all been damn good!	1
Happy hour!!!	1
About a year ago I went here and had an excellent steak and crab leg dinner. The atmosphere was good and the waitress was excellent. We went back recently for a mini celebration with our daughter and we were very disappointed. The waiter was sort of preoccupied and unfriendly, When I found out that crab legs were unavailable I was disappointed but understood why as they don't carry them year round. They felt that I still needed to talk to the manager because of my disappointment. I didn't but out he came anyway. He was wearing yesterday's wrinkled shirt with what looked like food stains on it. He also appeared very tired and thus unprofessional.  He apologized for not having the dish I wanted and told me when it would be available next.  The waiter could have done that. They then spilled a drink over the back of my coat. They got me a new drink, blah blah blah..... 2 of 5 stars for a chain restaurant.	0
I&#39;ll start by saying that this place was really delicious before the new menu and chef. The pizzas, smashed potatoes, and chicken with polenta were all outstanding. I told all of my local friends to go. <br><br>However, tonight I brought my mom and was sorely disappointed. The menu had changed and many of my old favorites were gone. That possibly would have been okay, had the pizza been the same. But the dough was totally different - bland and filled with those air pockets. It was just blah, blah, and not worth nearly $14 a pie (that is about individual size).<br><br>They also raised the prices. Our brussell sprouts were $10 and all of the glasses of wine are averaging $10.<br><br>I feel like this place was awesome until they messed with the menu and chef.<br><br>I will say that the service is fantastic. Great waiters and waitresses.	0
Hickory burger with cheese, fries welldone and a side of hickory sauce to dip! Followed by any of their cream pies! Tuna sandwich ain&#39;t half bad either but you just can&#39;t go wrong with a hickory burger! I have been going to the Pan since I was born. One of the best burgers in LA! Some of the servers have been there for almost as long! I prefer the dinner staff more then the lunch staff but that&#39;s just me...be warned you&#39;ll leave smelling like a hickory burger :-)	1
We didn&#39;t actually eat here, but I checked in just to warn newbies about their CASH ONLY POLICY. I find it ridiculous, and they lost our business because of it, but if you regularly carry three figures around it might be worth checking out. Lovely ambiance and helpful servers, what little we saw of them before we read the fine print at the bottom of the menu.	0
Intimate restaurant with a great ambiance. Had the special of the night, a braised lamb served over mashed potatoes. The meat was so tender it just fell off the bone. Nice flavor with the perfect hint of red wine. Tried my friend&#39;s grilled ribeye with garlic butter. A bit on the chewy side for medium rare. Will have to come back to try the mussels and beer!	1
Months ago, before I moved here, the lady friend sent me a picture of &#39;banh mi&#39; fries with the promise that once I did in fact come to NYC I would be taken there so I could sample this interesting take on Asian fusion.<br><br>Fast forward a few months to find Joju really small, really disorganized and the food just okay. Their Yelp offer gave a free egg on anything, so I got the pork belly with egg (runny) and got an order of the banh mi fries. I got charged for the egg, even though I showed the girl behind the counter the deal, she nodded and saw me mark the deal as used.<br><br>I eagerly waited at one of their tiny tables for my number to be called but it took a while to get. Fortunately, it gave me time to review my receipt and noticed the ordering mistake. One fluke in their ordering system and it snowballed from there, kind of like a restaurant butterfly effect. <br><br>We got our food and...it was just okay. Honestly expected a lot more, it was just a fairly basic sandwich made slightly better by the runny egg. My gf&#39;s sandwich had no egg and it was pretty blah. The fries were also similarly just okay, it basically seemed like fries with a bunch of veggies on it. I felt like I could have gotten the same product by eating a big burger and letting the toppings slide out of it. <br><br>Long wait, offset the okay sandwich and the cramped tables doesn&#39;t make me want to come back soon.	0
I ordered the fire of 1889 and it was amazing. The pork was perfectly seasoned the bread was fresh and delicious and the soup of the day (spicy corned beef) was killer. Definitely worth a visit.	1
After a fabulous Thanksgiving dinner at the Peacock we were eager to return for Christmas. However, we were sorely disappointed as staff was short and we had to ask for everything.  The buffet offering was not as well coordinated, and even the simple basics missed the mark. It may have been a result of the last seating, but similar to Thanksgiving hour.	0
Came here for dinner.. This place is EXTREMELY overpriced for the quality of the sushi and amount that you are getting. Smaller rolls are around $6-9, and larger are upwards of $12-16. I had the California Roll and Dragon. Rice, the foundation of any great sushi, was WAY too soft... Each bite of this mess was chewy and mushy, reminding me of sticky rice.. not what sushi is supposed to taste like, and really ruined the overall taste. The dishes are also lacking of consistency- my friends ordered the same roll, but each looked different upon presentation. A good restaurant should at least attempt to have a standardized approach in preparation.	0
Love the food. Do not love the service. <br><br>On a related note, I am not an expert on Peruvian food, but the negative yelp reviews seem too one-sided to be legit. I wonder if the competitor around the corner who happens to be mentioned in the negative reviews is orchestrating them. <br><br>On another side note, the old couple next to me who are taking about their sex life in Spanish (assuming I do not understand) has made this a night to remember.	1
great great service, fair prices and overall quality was excellent. just recently had a house warming party for about 30 guests and we catered from here. food was prepared at the best time because our hot foods were still hot and everything was ready to go.	1
The quality of the food and services  was not equivalent to the price. The bread that was served at the table was cold. We were never offered desert and the waiter was average. I would not go back. The  place has very nice atmosphere. For the money we spent we could have gone else where and received outstanding services and better quality of food.	1
Best Food.GREAT Wait staff.Last Old Time Vegas!!	1
food is pretty average though tasty 	1
Thin Pizza!	1
Iafter reading many good reviews I decided to try this buffet and I was completely dissapointed. Not only was the buffet particularly small but the food was mediocre at best. The crab legs and prime rib were the two best. The rest tasted like it was sitting for a long time. The waitress was very nice. It wasn&#39;t until after I was finished eating that my stomach felt the disaster which I had bestowed apon it. The food made me sick for hours and judging by the condition of the toilet I went into the person behind me agreed. Very over priced fr what you get. Take a walk around the hotel but skip the buffet and go to the one at ballagio for 10 bucks cheaper and food that won&#39;t make you sick.	0
Great food. Very nice owners. I have had at least 10-12 different dishes and never dissapointed. Try the green curry with noodles as a change but everything is good.	1
Norms is unique. Their steak sandwich is my favorite but the boys love the meatloaf and 40s of PBR!	1
I had eaten here the previous week and had a good experience. Decided to go back again today and I guess it&#39;s true when they say you can&#39;t go back home again. I ordered the daily special of a Greek chicken dish that was as tough as tire rubber. The side salad, rice, and green beans that came with the meal were fine and tasty. My wife had a gyro and ordered a side salad extra to accompany it, which is exactly what she ordered the week before. She was satisfied with her meal, but when the check came we were charged $5.95 for her tiny side salad instead of the $3.95 that the menu stated and that we were charged by the same server seven days ago. When asked about this she said that was a small salad and not a side salad and that $5.95 was the price. She turned and walked away very unfriendly. I decided rather than fighting about this I would deduct the extra few dollars from her tip and never go back to this restaurant again.	0
Came here for happy hour with some co-workers. The roof top has a great view and can get a bit chilly at times. We were near the fire pits so it felt perfect for us. On a good night you can catch some fireworks from the Hollywood Bowl.The service here was spotty. It took us a while for the wait staff to come and take our order, but once it got going it was fine.I was pretty disappointed in their happy hour seeing as most of the stuff on their happy hour menu is also on their dinner menu for the SAME EXACT PRICE. Where is the savings here? They have a few drink options that are lower priced, but it wasn't much of a happy hour. The food was good. I had the fish tacos and thought they were tasty. Some coworkers had the burgers and loved them. We also got the cheese plate that had a fantastic pistacho paste, but we had to keep asking them for bread since they only gave a couple of pieces on the cheese plate.Drinks were okay, not as strong as I would have liked especially for the price.	0
I visited Seattle for a month and Pesos was my favorite place to eat and grab a beer or cocktail. Seems like a bar/restaurant where all the cool kids go but also very chill.	1
Upon the suggestion of fellow Yelper, Tom W., I went in search of Tamiami Subs. Not being too familiar with the area, I kinda got lost and checked about 5 different strip malls before finding the place. It&#39;s alright though - it made me want the damn sub all that much more.<br><br>To begin with, the staff is super friendly, and they love to address you by name. Usually I would be totally creeped out by sub shop employees being so nice, but these guys seemed genuinely happy to have customers around. Just as Tom W. said, the man who prepared our sub first asked us if we had ever been to the place and then proceeded to recommend the Garlic Steak sub. He was very pleased to learn that we had come for that exact thing and that we had read a great review of it online.<br><br>The sub, in a word, was tasetacular. Or tastelicious. Possibly a tastearama? Pick whichever one you like; they all do the sub equal justice. I paid a little more than I usually expect to pay for a sub (about $14 for a full sub, two drinks and a cookie), but it was well worth the cost. <br><br>The eating area and restrooms were both immaculate, which is a big step up from other crappier strip mall joints. And they were playing Pink Floyd&#39;s &#34;Another Brick in the Wall&#34; followed by Eric Clapton&#39;s &#34;Layla&#34; while I ate, which won them about 100 brownie points. <br><br>Yelp suggestion FTW! Thanks Tom W.!	1
Wow....yummy!!!<br>Had a crepe - strawberries, blueberries, Nutella, vanilla ice cream with whip. This was only $7.25! The crepe was a really good size and the taste was fresh! The crepe coulda been a little bit<br>More done but it was good nonetheless! We will be back!	1
Steak dinner was cooked the way each of us wanted. The decor was black and white with pictures of old Vegas. We really  enjoyed it.	1
Finally had an opportunity to try this place for dinner at around 7:30 on a Wednesday. The area--Little Armenia--isn&#39;t somewhere I&#39;d really want to hang out in after dark, but it&#39;s not super sketchy. We found parking easily on Hollywood across from the restaurant, and the place was virtually empty except for a group playing pool. Service was friendly and quick; it&#39;s an order-at-counter place, and, from the look of the recycling bin, possibly BYOB. <br><br>They have daily specials, which is nice: Wednesday was burrito (asada or chicken) +chips n salsa = $6.99. I got the asada, b got the carnitas, fish and asada tacos. Total came out to $14. Not bad for a sit-down place. (though I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re really paying for ambiance...it&#39;s super dark in there, reminiscent of the neighborhood as a whole)<br><br>First impressions: salsa was EXCELLENT (and the server was super sweet about giving us a refill). Smoky, spicy smooth chipotle that left my mouth atingle but complemented rather than obscured what it was put on. I should have asked to try their &#34;suicide sauce&#34; and ghost pepper sauce! The burrito was also very good. A little bit uneven--ran into a couple of sizable meat deserts (rice and bean pockets), especially near the last third. But the meat was good quality and nicely seasoned. B enjoyed his tacos verily: he especially liked that the fish wasn&#39;t really greasy despite being battered. <br><br>I believe this place delivers with a $25 minimum, so it would be great for a group. For us two, it&#39;s a solid dinner/lunch option that I will definitely frequent again if I&#39;m in the area.	1
Excellent food, excellent service, very courteous and friendly staff. This restaurant is a gem. I HIGHLY recommend this restaurant, you definitely will not be sorry.	1
Meh is right. Food was bland and ridiculously over-priced. The ribs was actually a rib. $15 for a mediocre rib topped with gravy out of a can. Actually, it wasn't gravy out of a can. Gravy out of a can has more flavor. The scallops were pretty good but two for $15 is nuts. Seriously? Two? Way out of line. The goat cheese and pesto stuffed flatbread had way too much goat cheese. I know that sounds crazy but it's true. I love cheese. I could live on cheese. This had too much. And, I'm pretty sure the marinara they put on the flatbread was Ragu or Prego. Pathetic. They almost scored gold with the anchovies but they ruined the dish with a whopping gob of gross mayo. The service was great. We sat at the bar and ate. Bartenders were friendly and kept the wine and food coming. Wine selection was great, too. Unfortunately, neither the service or wine could make up for the terrible food. This place is living on location alone.	1
Thanks Yelp! for the free cactus blossom when we checked in. :) We were debating an appetizer for the table, so you made that decision easy for us!	0
It was my birthday weekend (and just over a year since my breast cancer diagnosis... kind of a big deal). My brother dropped me off in front while he went to park the car. I got the hostess' attention and noted that I had a party of 4. I was told that I could not be seated (even though the restaurant was EMPTY) because my entire party was not present. I pleaded with the hostess to let me sit down at a table (there is no waiting area in this restaurant) and the woman refused, claiming it was their policy to only seat full parties.I asked if I could grab a chair to sit down and the hostess refused. Finally, I indicated that I was a "party of one" and the hostess seated me.If someone is telling you that they need to sit down, use some common f-cking sense and let them sit. The fact that Umami employs morons like this means they'll never get my business.	0
This place is a lot of fun. Typical Wisconsin bar with added feature of ample tables for chow. All food is prepared behind the bar and it's fun to watch the activity. Give it a try for your next pub food outing.	0
Amazing foodAmazing margaritasYummy Sea Urchin guacamoleBest fish tacos I ever hadJeff and Jake really nice guys.	1
Really good! But the entire menu is in Korean so I don&#39;t really know how people who don&#39;t know the language would be able to order..<br><br>I&#39;ve gotten the bajirak kalgooksoo which is enough to feed two people. Pair that with the dumplings, and you&#39;ll be satisfied and full. Other good dishes are the chicken kalgooksoo and the bibim gooksoo. However, I think the best part about this restaurant is that they give you a bowl of barley rice and sesame oil and soybean paste that you mix in. Eat it with the yeolmoo kimchi and your mouth will be begging for more! It&#39;s a small bowl but it&#39;s enough to fend off your hunger until your food comes. <br><br>This place is sometimes VERY crowded and sometimes VERY empty. I have never seen it have just a decent number of people in it. Parking is difficult and you have to valet park for $2.	1
A very disappointing experience. Given all the great reviews, I was expecting great service and food. <br><br>First, the service was lack luster. The waiter took a long time to came back to get our order and then tried to give me attitude. Okay, he knew he screwed up and tried to make it up with a complimentary amuse bouche. However, he seemed to have disappeared after that. For the prices you are paying at this restaurant, the service should be much better. <br><br>Food was just okay. It was just another good meal in the city. I ordered the swordfish which was on the salty side for me. Nothing to write home about. The prices are on the high side while the portions are on the small side and the amount of wine that the waiter pours for you is also on the small side.	0
Made an order in advance for 10 people. They made the order an hour early which we were okay with. But it arrived after a fair amount of time (delivery), so much that he food was cold. The food wasn't great tasting either. Average all round!	0
I'm not one to complain but i felt compelled. My wife and i were intending to go have a happy hour bite at AZUL in mill creek but due to it being packed we decided to try this fairly new place. Menu seemed decent we ordered food. didnt get water. Bar is located pretty much in the kitchen which wasnt fun. Got our baked provolone and calamari sliders which were decent calamari tenders were way too salty it took server at least 15 minute to realize we werent eating our food. didnt even get the remainder of our order. Calamari was removed from the check but not the buffalo wings that we never recieved. And to add to our frustration and disapointment we were shorted on changge by $10. 	0
I have a love hate with this place. I work down the street so I would be a regular had they wowed me over a little better. The food is DELICIOUS which is why I&#39;m so upset that their customer service sucks. I waited for over 30 minutes for my order to go. As I stood there and impatiently texted my husband about how much the service sucks I was leaning against the tall deli case when I had about 30 knives thrown at me!! The waitress was on the other side of the case and went to grab a knife from the bucket when she tipped it over and every knife fell on me. Ok. Accidents happen. I didn&#39;t lose an eye or a toe so I wasn&#39;t pissed about the incident. What I was mad about was the way the waitress handled it. Barely muttered a sorry and then WATCHED me as I picked up the knives that were surrounding me and in between my toes! Had I done that I would have apologized PROFUSELY and then expedited my order and offered some sort of peace offering (even a cookie would&#39;ve been accepted!). No no.. I stood there for ANOTHER 15 minutes while everyone avoided eye contact with me. I was tempted to cancel my order and tell them to shove it. <br><br>Fortunately my sandwich and fries were amazing. Which again makes me sad that the people there suck.	0
Get home at 3am and need some food. Found this place on yelp and called. Ordered some pad Thai and soup. Delivery was fast. Food was delicious and still hot. Found a couple egg rolls in the bag which was a nice surprise. Good portions - legit spicy at level 3. Called when they got to the door. Great spot!	1
Great place!<br><br>I stopped in for brunch with a friend and the food was great! I got the play on Eggs Benedict with their house made sausage instead of Canadian bacon. It was delicious. We sat at the bar and the bartender, Carly, was super nice and made us feel very welcome. I don&#39;t get down to the LES too often but I would definitely stop in here again if I do.	1
I&#39;ve eaten at The Runner twice now. <br><br>The first time I dined here, I was eating alone and sat in the bar area. I ordered from the menu and after a while was informed that I had received the wrong menu... UGH... I was really looking forward to what I ordered... oh well. Ordering round two: I opt for the gruyere/onion flat-bread(?) and the lentil soup with creme fraiche. <br>Overall, the food was good (not amazing) and the service was &#34;rocky&#34; (longer story). -2star overall-<br><br>Now for the SECOND time I dined here:<br><br>My parent&#39;s stopped to visit me for my birthday while on their way back from CT. My best friend is also in town to celebrate with me. We were too late to make reservations for another place we wanted to try, so we decided to give The Runner a try. I didn&#39;t want my previous experience to damper their experience so I kept it to myself (I wanted to give the place a second chance anyway).<br><br>Our meal was great!! Our waiter was great! Wow... totally different experience. <br><br>Right off the bat, the waiter and manager(?) were very friendly (perhaps they remembered me). To start, we ordered the the chopped salad, mac&amp;cheese, and chicken liver mouse. A solid start. Also, while we were eating our apps, they brought out complimentary popovers (with a molasses butter)... wow, they were so good! They alone are enough to bring me back and bumped up our appetizer round. <br><br>Main course, we order the smashed potatoes for the table, my friend and I split the roasted chicken (whole) and my parents both order the short rib with horseradish and beets. *Mind you, I was very skeptical of how they would turn out and what the portions would be like.* What a joy, the chicken was moist/flavorful and the accompanying salad cut the heaviness of it well. My parents&#39; short ribs were cooked well, the horseradish was present but not killer, and the beets were yummy. Our smashed potatoes were good with the creme fraiche, but for me, potato dishes rarely (if ever) blow me away. <br><br>I was genuinely too full for desert, but as it was my birthday, they brought out a piece of chocolate cake with a candle. It was a solid chocolate cake (which I don&#39;t usually go for) with a tasty cream cheese(?) frosting. <br><br>In the end, I&#39;m very glad I went back and had a surprisingly memorable meal! <br><br>Based on my experiences and what I&#39;ve read on here, the place is having growing pains.. hopefully, they can work out some of the kinks/inconsistencies and start on the road to lasting success. I will be back, fingers crossed.	1
Pretty good! I always drive by Amena when I go for my groceries. Looked them up on Yelp and had to try it after reading their positive reviews. We were looking for something healthy that night and it filled the spot. <br><br>I loved their pickled sides and the salad was awesome. The chicken was seasoned well and their homemade pitas sold me; thick and fluffy. But what really sealed the deal was the baklava and mango drinks. The baklava was filled with a strong cinnamon flavor and light on the honey with crushed Pistachios on top; yummy! The Mango drink was light, iced and refreshing.<br><br>I wish the prices were a little lower, but it was a great visit with excelent customer service.<br><br>Thank you for the extra pitas!	1
24 hours AND the food tastes decent.Okay, more than decent. I'm in love with the Roast Turkey Avocado Panini. I mean people, this is the ultimate Panini. The bread is grilled so perfectly that it almost hurts as you crunch through the incredible exterior. Hurts so good.The Lobster Grilled Cheese really ain't my best friend. I ate half and felt a bit queasy from all that mushy creaminess. But the two boys who devoured the other half had absolutely no complaints. Excellente according to these two compadres.Plus, Klatch Coffee! Definitely did a double take with that one, and thought I was back in San Dimas. Good coffee always contributes to a smilier day.	1
The first time I came here the service was awful but everyone raves about it so I tried it again. Came back and still got awful service and the food isn't that amazing. But the worst thing about the entire experience is the valet. Or lack there of to be honest. Not sure why they would only have one person working on a Friday night. Seems to be very poorly managed.	0
This visit I had the lobster roll. It could not have been better. Ordered the fries just plain without the truffle seasoning. They were excellent too. Love this place and it's walking distance to the Music Center and Walt Disney Concert Hall.	1
Ordered a brisket sandwich and an order of baby back ribs and two drinks for 33 bucks. Over priced for the quality of the food. My order was to go and we ate the food about 15 minutes receiving the food. <br><br>Brisket sandwich was horrible. It was so dry that I couldn&#39;t take more that 2 bites. Waffle fries were stale hard and cold. The baby back ribs we&#39;re ok but cold and they forgot the side item I ordered. Will never go back.	0
Pheonemal! I had to have the pumpkin soup after I was given a sample! The greek wrap was so tasty too and not just put together like most places! Give that mango chipotle barbecue a go if you&#39;re a fan of all things barbecue like I am!	1
Okay, I was wondering why so many other reviews compare it with Chipotle. It&#39;s because the place is a mini-Chipotle, but it is a bit cheaper.<br><br>When I went, they were out of pinto beans. Black beans were the only choice. That&#39;s kind of lame. They also didn&#39;t have any crispy shell tacos--which I wasn&#39;t looking for, but it suggests to me that they aren&#39;t quite ready for prime time. <br><br>There are some things they seem to do better than Chipotle: the rice looks better, for one. But the carne asada looked like it came out of a rhinoceros&#39;s ass. I almost ordered it until I got an up-close view.<br><br>All in all, not worth the money saved compared to Chipotle, but not horrible, either.	0
The best pancakes ( flap jacks) I have ever had! The service is excellent (especially at the counter) . Great coffee too!	1
We sat at the bar and it was so hot that I was covered in sweat by the time we left the place. The food was okay but nothing fantastic - I'll try anthing once but I don't think I will be going back.	0
Just what the neighborhood needed. The night we were there it was crowded but the owner seated us quickly (even with a celebrity waiting for a table!). Great beer list, good bottles of wine under $30. Food was delicious and I appreciated the shorter menu - I&#39;d rather have a chef present a short list of masterful favorites than a long list that&#39;s hard to distinguish. The room is very pretty, too. A perfect neighborhood bistro.	1
The food was good, which was consistent with previous visits, however the service was slow and there was an issue with the bill.	1
Spaghetti alla carbonara is hard to make.  I know. I've tried.  The key ingredients are Parmigiano-Reggiano and Romano or Pecorino.  It is a sin to add creme of any kind.  I'm not sure what Luna did but the result was a completely tasteless, sticky mess.  Did I say Carbonara is hard to make?  If the Rockfish filet had been well-prepared, I would not be writing this review.  It too was bland and tasteless.  The service was great and friendly.  If the food were OK it would be a Cheers sort of place.	0
I was driving aimlessly around town when I happened upon this little gem. I had the Hakata Ramen which was great and the broth was delicious! And I decided to treat myself to some mochi ice-cream as well :) My server was very efficient and very friendly considering it was closing time. I think he works off a helluva lot of calories off while he bustles around! The staff greet you when you come in and thank you when you leave. This cozy little place was very happy discovery. A very pleasant experience overall.	1
Ambitious menu foiled by incredibly bad service.I've been here many times over the years, I live right down the street. This place is so inconsistent, you never really know what to expect. But after my last visit I'm not sure if there's anything that can get me to go back.The waiter was way too busy to, um, wait on us. When he did grace us with his presence he proved that he knew nothing about the food that was on the menu.I asked about a fish dish which he described as, "kind of like a Sea Bass" and that it was "grilled". What I got was a tiny trout-like fish steamed in parchment paper. It took a lifetime for our main courses to arrive and when my entree came it was barely warmer than room temperature. I was starving so I ate it anyway. I think it would have been good if it was warm. My girlfriend asked if her dish would come with vegetables since she was craving veggies. He assured her, yes. When it came it was actually a bouillabaisse in which the vegetables were pureed inside the broth. No visible veggies at all. At least her dish was hot and, despite the lack of greenery, it was pretty good. Then our dirty dishes stayed on our table forever as we tried to flag down our waiter for the check. This was on a Wednesday and not even very busy. It seemed like we were at this restaurant for an eternity. The ambience and menu is what makes this place so popular and I have had good experiences here in the past. But bad service spoils the whole experience for me so I think I'll head to Blair's the next time I'm in the mood for fine dining in Silverlake.	0
I went to Per Diem for a drink the week that it opened and found it to be a cool little spot for happy hour. The decorations are fun and interesting. Today, I decided I want to try this place for lunch. I found that Per Diem lacks decent hospitality. The two front desk people were more interested in giggling at each other than asking me if I had any questions regarding the menu. That's not the issue though.After briefly looking over the menu, I picked the chicken sandwich with the heirloom tomato soup. The wait wasn't bad for my to-go order. I work super close to this restaurant so as soon as I got my food, I was back in the office. It was so disappointing to find that the heirloom tomato soup was lukewarm and, for the most part, unappetizing. Seller's Market has better tomato soup. Also, when I tried the sandwich, the bottom was soggy. Overall, maybe I didn't get the right sandwich or Per Diem serves hot soup only if you eat at the restaurant, but I'm disappointed. The bill was $16 - I should have went to Chipotle a couple times instead.	0
My first visit to Commissary was for a late midweek breakfast with a friend. The space is amazing. A virtual greenhouse stands out on a roof ledge and creates a great atmosphere. The sun drenched dining area presents as a warm, cozy and inviting space. There are plants hanging throughout the restaurant creating a true agrarian feel. The items we ordered (breakfast burrito & French toast) and shared were absolutely delicious and I would order either one again; although our server indicated the pancakes are the bomb. Maybe next time. The wait staff was very attentive, informative, and friendly, which rounded out our great experience. The dining room offers the choice of private or communal tables to create community and accommodate parties of all sizes. This would be a great location for a private party or special occasion.	1
So delicious! I got the French dip sandwich and loved it.	1
Really tasty and fresh food. Only complaints are that the parking lot is tiny and usually full, and the food takes quite a bit if you order there. If you&#39;re on a timeline for lunch like I am, order ahead.	1
I really like the Brazilian mocha. Not sure what makes it brazilian; the delicate balance of coffee to chocolate is perfect.	1
Great food! We ordered two breakfast burritos. Extremely fresh and healthy. No oil dripping like some restaurants. Breakfast for two with tax, $22 which is a fair price. The waitress was o.k. while the waiter was great. Super friendly, talkative, interested, etc. he has two small children and talked to us about our infant daughter. Really personable. We were in and out within 45 minutes. No complaints. If I'm ever in the area again, I will be back!	1
I used to love the place. But now i hate it. Everything&#39;s getting worse and worse. Price, quality, quantity, and service. I&#39;m not gonna go there again.	0
I didn&#39;t like it at all, the wait was really long and the buns are hard. The fries aren&#39;t good either really soggy. Won&#39;t be coming back	0
Wow, over 500 reviews for Bloom Cafe.I went here at the suggestion of a relative, and it was a very pleasant experience. We went for brunch. The orange juice was deliciously homemade, super yum. I got huevos rancheros, which I've never had before, and they were so delicious. I would go back just for them! If you're in the area and need a healthy, hip place to eat brunch, hit up Bloom Cafe!	1
Closed Wednesdays? WTF?	0
You NEED to try this place. <br><br>A+ for taste, freshness, and vibe.<br><br>It&#39;s tucked away in the alley behind Melrose Place, which you can either get to from Melrose Ave. or just walk through the commercial building that Alfred&#39;s is in to the back where it connects. <br><br>They have an amazing burrata salad, grilled cheese, some chocolate/peanut butter cake that&#39;s to die for and tons of other stuff. The menu changes week to week but everything I&#39;ve tried so far has been delicious.<br><br>If you want to look cool and hip with your friends, come here. Prices are good, and the food is even better.	1
Definitely a fan of this place and I love the vibe and the fact that I can watch Ballerinas on a Sunday while I wait for my breakfast to be served. We go almost every weekend and have the huevos and the breakfast wrap. So good. Couple of issues I've been noticing since they opened that might need some attention by staff and management:-the flies. went there today to eat a TBA sandwich and I was eating with one hand and shooing away the flies with another. not a good look and quite gross.-two times recently I have gone in and they have been out of the item I wanted to order. the item I drove all the way up for...waited in line behind an indecisive lady and then finally got up to the register to order and the employee told me they were out of what I wanted. PUT IT UP ON YOUR BOARD when you're out guys. NOTIFY us while we're waiting in line so the people behind us don't have to wait while we figure out our PLAN B and also, make sure you have enough inventory on weekends. -service from the kitchen is slow. sometimes it's 15-25 at most then others it goes quite a bit longer. it's annoying when you're hungry. front of the house is tentative and amazing but the back of the house has got some issues or so it seems.The only time when hipsters bother people is when you're not a hipster yourself. Don't let the fact that hipsters hang out here stop you from coming. It's not that pretentious. I'm not even a hipster and the staff is super cool to me and my other half. They are always warm and tentative and want to do a good job. We love this place but it looks like they need to give the kitchen and the flies a good swat in the ass. Oh and the dust on the ceiling that you can see is thick as shit all over the fixtures when you sit up top. Do something about that P + P. The neighborhood loves you and wants to see you stay but you are slippin!	1
At first the crowded, bustling atmosphere with low lighting and only a sliver of elbow room made me wonder how comfortable my dining experience would be... and the answer.. very!As we acclimated to the low lighting and murmurs of conversations, I truly enjoyed the French Bistro atmosphere, which transplants you to a Persian hot spot in the middle of a shady neighborhood in downtown LA.The goat cheese and lavender honey app was fantastic. I'm a sucker for sweet and salty combos.I also got the broccolini side (as an app) which was smothered in garlic and topped with crispy onion rings.The pan roasted chicken was also a fav, as well as the sturgeon in puff pastry.Wine and cocktail list is great too.It's appropriate to sit a the bar with a glass of red, a few apps, and some great conversation.	1
$20 credit card minimum? EFF YOU	0
This place was pretty darn good ^^! I recommend getting the number 3 with sourdough bread instead of french toast or pancakes and bacon!! Can't forget the side of Orange Juice~ the portions are good for the price :)! I would definitely come here again!	1
Two stars strictly for our great waiter Pietro..His smile and gracious demeanor was the best yet in Miami. The restaurant on the other hand leaves much to be desired concerning their food. I started with the Mussels which not only were tasteless ,but those that were actually in the shells were so small that they weren&#39;t worth eating. I&#39;m from Philly and if any place there served such garbage they would be out of business in 2 days. My girlfriend had the fruitta De mare in parchment. It contained pasta, some of those same mussels, small shrimp and was completely tasteless. I had the ravioli which was decent albeit salty. However, it was good enough to eat. The waiter once again was phenomenal and took off the mussels and my girlfriend&#39;s enter.He also comped her a glass of wine. One of the owners or managers kept walking by our table, at least 15 times and never stopped to inquire as to our satisfaction.<br><br>Those that have rated the food highly have absolutely no clue what good food and seasoning is about.<br><br>The worst part is that it&#39;s a great room, however I would never go back.<br><br>If it weren&#39;t for Pietro I would have given this place a negative 5 rating. Really disappointed.	0
Excellent Original Crispy Chicken. Super juicy meat with crumbly yet extremely crunchy batter. Thought it would be similar to Kyochon but the batter & flavors here are distinctively different. Unable to pinpoint the seasonings used - another reviewer had noted it tastes faintly like vanilla and I could definitely see that as It does have a slightly sweet aroma along the lines of coconut oil... Slightly spicy as well. While determining quantity to order I was lead to believe the pieces are small and a half order (8 pieces) of whole chicken would be big enough for one individual. Well, I'm not sure how much of an eater you are and this is coming from a big girl, but 8 pieces is more than enough for two parties. The whole chicken (16 pieces) would easily feed a family of 4. It takes a good 15 minutes or more for an order to be completed so call in advance if short on time for pickup.	1
Hooray for Jewish food at midnight! I&#39;ve only been here once, but I got way more food than I could eat, and I got to stare at a crazy stained-glass ceiling. Oh, and the busboy was wearing one of those &#34;I -heart- Canters&#34; shirts. Freakin awesome	1
I can only assume that &#39;EnHakkore&#39; translates to &#39;No bathroom&#39;. Food was good and well-priced, but no public bathroom is ridiculous.	0
This is a little take out place with some benches that are covered.<br><br>Never had a Fritas being new to Miami. Went here to try them.<br><br>The cuban sandwitch was not very good here. The Fritas were tasty, but quite dry. I have to try one other place before I can really say its specifically this place or just Fritas in general.<br><br>Nice staff as well.	0
My friend and I had the Tuna Nikki. We both got the runs. Go next door instead (Garcias).	0
I&#39;ve been to Fresco twice, once for dinner and today for lunch. The first time I had a salad with grilled chicken on it, and I wasn&#39;t impressed. The chicken was dry and somewhat tasteless. I could have put together a better salad with my eyes closed. I went today for lunch and had the Fresco Combo. Although the soup was good, the sandwich wasn&#39;t and the turkey in it tasted like rubber. My boyfriend had the meatball sandwich and disliked it so much he didn&#39;t eat it. I definitely won&#39;t be visiting again.	0
The Michelada Popsicle is brand new to me, but makes complete sense. It keeps the beer cold while adding flavor! Speaking of. Flavor, the octopus and the pork belly tacos were great. Pig ear salad was decent. The tacos aren't cheap, but are definitely delicious.	1
This place is trendy and new. There are only 6 small tables inside and a short bar. Basically they serve the vietnamese sandwiches. I ordered the 5-spice chicken and my friend ordered the eggplant sandwiches. They are OK and did not wow us. Nothing really specail or authentic about the food. You can get the same or even better ones at half prices in normal Vietnamese resturants. The prices are too high. I gues it is because of the location. It is pretty for Caucasian-ized for sure. No. I wont go back again.	0
I love Canters!The token place to go after a drunken night out. Maybe that's why I love it so much!I don't understand the kvetching about the bitter hosts/waiters since that's what makes this place so kitchy and lovely. The food. The food that's what we're here for, right? The menu can be overwhelming there's hundreds of items. I usually get the avocado melt. Mmmm. They come with fat steak fries. My ex used to get the tuna melt which is also very tasty. I'm not a fan of Italian meats, but I've heard that they are very good here and he's a fan of them. They say the upstairs bathroom is haunted. I didn't know this until a friend told me. I always attributed the moving shadows to being drunk. The bathrooms are scary though. The one upstairs because of the creepiness factor, the one downstairs in the kibitz room because it's tiny. So tiny you can't open the door all the way if someone is washing their hands.All in all Canter's is a classic Los Angeles Landmark and they should be forgiven for most of their flaws as long as they have an A in the window. It's definitely worth a try if you've never been here before. Just keep in mind the quirky characteristics that makes Canter's, Canter's.	1
Seems like they worked a lot of the kinks out. Great view, staff was friendly and food was inventive and very good. Because of the location it&#39;s much less douchey than the typical Hollywood crowd, so count me in!	1
BEWARE! Did takeout here today and was charged $42 for 6 tacos, full pork plate and 2 calypso lemonades and I&#39;ve got the bank statement to prove it. Being new here, I did not question the price but checked the menu pricing found online a little later. What a jip. Never again.	0
Do not go for the 4.99 steak &amp; eggs before it was so good now it is shit. The steak looks like charcoal the eggs suck and the hashbrowns potion is tiny. Go to Ellis island next door don&#39;t make the mistake I did.	0
I love La Brea French bread's chewy outside and soft, almost sweet inside so much it makes me want to move to LA, marry a loaf, and make little baby baguettes.	1

Good<br>Bar food,<br>Nice design,<br>Big patio,<br>And strong beer list. Fine service and chill vibe.	1
recently heard there was a "new" Magnolia, and since i live so close, decided to try it--though i thought the "old" magnolia was a tourist trap with overpriced, bland food that wasn't very well prepared.sooo... we ordered two sausage dishes, chicken and chickpea/pine nut, with two sides each: cauliflower and sweet potato; brussels sprouts and fries. the chickpea "sausage" (really just a breaded patty) had a nice taste and texture, but really needed some kind of sauce or chutney to go with it--very dry on its own. neither of us liked the chicken sausage, which tasted like ground chicken with a hint of beer--it definitely needed some seasoning! i didn't finish mine. the cauliflower (mostly al dente, yay) and brussels (a little overcooked, but nice taste) were both ok, but very oily--it seemed like the crocks they were served in were just coated in oil. there was a huge wad of honey butter on the sweet potato, and the fries were ok, nothing special. oily too. all together, i felt a bit ill after ingesting all this oil and butter. it all probably would have tasted better with beer, but that doesn't excuse the heaviness. all of the sides are heavy that way. service was attentive but it was extraordinarily busy and loud in there, which i can deal with, but combined with the weird food, i can't imagine going back for dinner. after reading about a cornmeal waffle with bacon, i *may* check that out for breakfast sometime --it's hard to find waffles. but my expectations are VERY low. i still say: TOURIST TRAP.	0
We always take visitors here. Love the wine selection and sharing small plates. Especially love the pate!!!	0
OMG. All of these great reviews are spot on. Food great. Service fast. My new place to eat before I get on the plane. You can't go wrong with Mango.	1
It is good. And our waiter was super nice. The avocado toast was tasty. Could use a squeeze of like tho. To add a tang. Hash browns were Delish. Kale was good too. Some pieces had a crisp that was cool.	1
Was the first time here. Was highly impressed with service/staff. They were very helpful and friendly and made their own recommendations. I would highly recommend the Mussles and Fries as an appetizer. Both the Salmon and Mahi Mahi fish entree&#39;s were delectable. For desert, go with the campfire favorite. The Smores!!!!!!!!! <br><br>Overall very happy with the experience and will be planning my next trip soon.	1
Great take on mexican food.  Really enjoyed the ambiance, upbeat but not too stuffy.  Great place to grab a bite before a show at Mandalay Bay!  I would definitely come back for more!	1
Food: the food is okAtmosphere: very nice decor, very open spaceService: dependableIn the heart of japantown, I would go here if I wanted ramen before any other place. But still missing so much..	0
Food tasted bland. Limited menu. Pricey.	0
This one of my favorite restaurants in all of Ktown and maybe js in general. And its def my fav seafood place. Everytime Ive gone there, we've gotten the combos, which are amazing. Everything that comes out from start to finish is delicious there and I have yet to try something i didnt like. My mouth is starting to water js thinking bout it. I will say the ventilation kinda sucks, but with food this good.. who can really complain. This is seafood paradise!	1
Super chill, nice service, food is awesome, Jacque is very kind nd sweet, Mike P Hilarious, shows on Tuesday, only thing that sucks is spacing, where am I supposed to put my hookah, oh I know in the alley	1
Waiter was great and tried his best on a busy night! Manager was completely rude... Not coming back again because of the treatment from the manager	0
Wow. This place was absolutely disgusting. I am not sure how anyone gives this anything more han one star. Ordered the chicken empanadas. I bit into it and it was ice cold. When I call the server over, he immediately says. &#34;are they cold&#34; telling me that this is not the first time this has happened. My entree was the flat chicken with rice and beens. The rice tested old and the chicken lacked any seasoning at all. The beans were bland. <br><br>Why this place has any business is beyond me. It is clear that many just don&#39;t know what quality food is in South Florida. I would highly recommend that you stay away form this pit they call a restaurant.	0
The ramen here is delicious. I ordered the chile and green onion ramen cooked medium. It was quite flavorful but really not that spicy (condiments are perched above the tables however - you can always add heat). 	1
Authentic tasting Italian food. We felt a bit rushed. Food came out much too quickly for a relaxing meal. Smaller portions with reduced prices would bring me back sooner for another try. Drink prices were also excessive. I will probably forego alcohol on my next visit. Too bad.	0
You know that you had an amazing meal when you wake up the next morning thinking about it! My visit to Boqueria was exceptional. The service was spot on. Our waitress was friendly and knowledgeable. Everything she recommended was exceptional. Unless their entire menu is just that good? If that&#39;s the case, I can&#39;t wait to go back and try all the other items.<br><br>If you make it out here, you gotta try the squid-ink paella. OUT-OF-THIS-WORLD! So original and tasty. Mmm. And get the lamb meatballs. It&#39;s packed with so much flavor! I can go on and on about what to get but the only way is to actually get out there and try it for yourself!!	1
I had two bowls of their shoyu ramen in the span on three days. I happened to be in town for a wedding and we came here twice during our stay. The price was right and the variety of ramen satisfied everyone in our group. The shoyu was not as heavy as the other options, but still delicious and rich. <br><br>The people in the staff are nice, too!	1
Clarification: I'm a fan is a bit of over statement. But I'm willing to give it a second try. Why? Because their papaya salad - a must order item on my southeastern restaurant outing - was pretty good.	0
Terrible! We were so excited to try this place and all 3 of us were way underwhelmed. The server was nice and yet it still gets a 1 star. Had the Greek salad which was so gross, I couldn&#39;t stomach it. When my sister tried it her reaction was the same. How can you mess up greek salad? My husband and sister ordered the fish tacos and they were so bland and boring that they both just kinda went, &#34;uh.&#34; We also tried the pepperoni wrapped pretzels that were super gross and the cheese sauce, while ok, was so salty when combined with the pretzels it was almost inedible. The fries appetizers were so tiny, thin cut, nasty and looked and tasted so cheap; and yet surprise, they were expensive!!! After spending $100 for lunch for 3 people (no liquor or desserts) we expected to really like at least one item but we were all very disappointed and didn&#39;t really care for any...and this is coming from the least picky eaters ever. Way better places out there! Try The Social House if you happen to like Japanese...it&#39;s way cheaper (don&#39;t let the fancy outside detour you) and all 6 of us were amazed at how good it was! Another one we tried in Vegas was Goodwich. Yes, it&#39;s a little scary on the outside and it&#39;s kind of a hot dog stand type set up that sells sandwiches but WOW, Amazing sandwiches!!! The 3 of us fell in love! Do yourself a favor and try anywhere else but here.	0
I never venture out into the Everglades, but I&#39;ll probably head back to the marshland for another dinner at Bonsai. The location is out West (out very, very West), but it&#39;s so worth it. <br><br>Here was what we tried: the Rockin&#39; Shrimp appetizer (their version of Nobu&#39;s Rock Shrimp)- this dish was very tasty. We also had the kanisu roll which was also very good (and not to mention cut up to fit, which was an added plus b/c the kanisu roll is usually very big). The E Roll (eel tempura, crab, and cream cheese) was fabulous! So was the chicken pad thai that we ordered. For dessert we tried their fried ice cream, which was superb!<br><br>Our waiter was also very nice and very patient with all of our questions (some of the guests were eating very exotic looking dishes that included lobster tails hanging from martini glasses).	1
Dante's is an experience. Yeah they are really fratty. Yeah they have weird stuff on the walls. But the bartenders pour a mean drink for a very reasonable price. I always order off the nightly specials and have never been disappointed.	1
My wife and I booked this through Open Table because it was close to Sculler's Jazz Club and offered Open Table bonus points.  We were pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food and attentive service.  The Chilean Sea Bass with ginger was amazing, as was the special brown fried rice and the calamari appetizer.  A bit pricey for Chinese, but well worth it.  Warning that valet parking is $10 and no signage to that effect.  But our car was waiting for us when we walked out, so if you're tight for time it is a nice service.	1
So delicious!	1
LARGE GROUPS STAY AWAY!! Monty&#39;s completely ruined my birthday with their ridiculous and outdated &#34;no split checks&#34; policy. How are you going to have large, group-friendly tables, yet not accept multiple cards on a table. <br><br>They encourage each guest to pay as they go (which after a couple margaritas can be a little challenging). The initial credit card ends up paying the balance of whoever paid less, forgot, rolled off drunk, etc. NOT COOL Monty&#39;s.	0
Always great! Great staff, great food, fair price!	1
The view looking out to the harbor is great.  The food and options for Sunday Brunch were above average.  The service was below average.  We made reservations more than a month in advance.  We arrived on time.  Our table was not ready (this was the first seating for brunch).  Once we were seated, the service was fair to poor.  It was very difficult to get the attention of the staff for any request.  What used to be included in the the Sunday Brunch is now an extra charge (and over the top expensive).  Every year the White Elephant scrimps on food and service to squeeze more profit. Disappointing!	1
Can't review the quality of the chicken because after waiting over 30 minutes it never arrived. Waiter never checked on our table either. There seemed to be some kind of preference shown to the phone orders because loads of those came and went. Hate to admit it but we just peaced without getting the food we ordered. This is also one of those places where you're kind of SOL if you don't speak Korean.	0
The brusque efficiency of the servers and the barebones, old-school decor add a lot of great character to the place. The hickory burger had good hickory flavor, but unfortunately, a burger needs more than a special sauce to make it great - in fact, a great burger doesn't need any sauce at all. It was drowning in ketchup and mayo, on top of the hickory sauce, and had a monstrous chunk of iceberg lettuce in it. The meat patty was rather small and not very high-quality, at ALL. Fries were on par with typical diner-quality, in other words, not worth the calories. I went at 3:00 on a Wednesday afternoon and it was still crowded! I really can't believe this made any "best burger" list for the city, it's definitely not worth a special trip or a long wait.	0
This is our second visit to Annapolis smokehouse. The service was attentive and food wonderful. The portion sizes are large so be prepared to have leftovers...which is a good thing.	0
My boyfriend and I love going to this place for late night eats. The vibe is great, so is the food. Lots of veggie options.	1
Good breakfast place, kind of in a ghetto strip mall area. The sign out front says &#34;Bakery&#34; and not &#34;Lemon Poppy Kitchen&#34; which was slightly confusing.. <br>The drink I got was the citrus melody, but what I really wanted was the ginger-lime. They were out of every flavor except the citrus melody and lemonade which was disappointing. <br>I got the standard breakfast- but I don&#39;t eat meat, so I tried to substitute and they were very unhelpful.. Not really willing to substitute for what I wanted even though bacon was more expensive on the menu.. The homemade ketchup is absolutely disgusting. It tastes like extremely sweet spaghetti sauce.. How does that work with eggs? It doesn&#39;t. I asked for eggs over hard- and part of my plate is running with yolk, get my order right.<br>The service was decent, but the food spoke for itself.	0
What a shame... Food is good but carpet stinks so much you don&#39;t want to eat.. We had to leave as soon as we sat down.	0
Small size plates. Very expensive. Food ok. By no means worthy of a second visit with all the other great peruvian restaurants in Miami.	0
I wouldn't recommend Ray's for the everyday working class kind of guy. But this is what is available at the Art Museum. While waiting for a Museum Music Concert to start my friend and I went to Ray's so we could get a drink. We just wanted something quick. Because really we're just hear for the music and if time permits some art.I got a signature drink, and she got a desert. It took forever! My drink should not take more than 25min to serve, especially for the prices they charge. The drink was decent not worth the wait.The desert was beautifully prepared, but a little bland. It was a yogurt like substance.Never gonna go back...	0
The stuffed french toast is the bomb !	1
A bit delayed on the review but here it is!I came here shortly after their soft opening awhile back with my sister. We live literally a block a way and enjoy the vast amount of places to eat from Chinese, Mexican, Italian, Vegan, Indonesian, & now this! The decor of this places is nice, although I haven't been here in the day, I like how dim lit this place is at night. There are a few TVs hanging around in here so you can pretty much catch the game from wherever you sit. They have a ping pong table in the back where they have their fountain resembling a bar tap. I ordered a few things Lobster Sliders, Chicken Parmesan Sliders, Fries, Burrata & Arugula Salad. I'm not going to go in full depth with how each dish tasted but what stood out to me were the Chicken Parmesan Sliders and their fries. I could literally sit for hours eating their fries. I ordered the Lobster Sliders based off a previous review but my buns were slightly burnt in which case I literally just ate everything but the buns. All in all food came out fast and was satisfying. I have yet to come back!	1
For some reason, I have been trying to go to this place since it opened and never got here. Today that changed... <br><br>It&#39;s an eeny place, very clean, great layout. My confusion with all of the reviews I&#39;ve read is this place is KNOWN for it&#39;s burger, so if you didn&#39;t get the burger, you are taking a chance. It is a little overly pricey, but the burger was worth it... <br><br>We did get the burger. Mine came with a little extra something-something, that I won&#39;t get into detail about (it&#39;s something NOT edible) but I do understand that these things happen and did not snap a cord over it. The staff jumped on it and not only made the situation better by getting me a new plate of food, but brought my table little extras and when the bill came, more good surprises. <br><br>Now for the food -- the burger was perfect. It was a whole different deal, being on an English muffin and all, but the grilled onions paired with the Gruyere were pure heaven. It was thick and juicy, but not so large that you felt like a glutton. The sweet potato fries were so perfect that my anti-sweet potato lovin&#39; friends even dug in and remarked how amazing they were. <br><br>I can imagine that this place would be PURE HELL on a busy night, but on a breezy Sunday afternoon, the music, the staff and the ambience was perfect.	1
My best friend chose BarMeli to celebrate her birthday. She contacted the owner and made reservations for a group of 18 people. For being a small place, the accommodation was made. However, for it being such a large party, some people were unable to make it on time or at all. With that said, the owner felt so compelled to confront the birthday girl in a very nasty way in front of her entire dinner table and tell her that it was not fair that she had to turn people away because of our large party. Let&#39;s face it, we cannot control everything. People ran late &amp; people canceled last minute. And still, majority of the party showed, we were only short 4 people. <br><br>I completely understand the owners frustration being that Saturday&#39;s are her busiest night and she turned away business in an effort to accommodate the reservation that was made but there is a right and wrong way to handle every situation. She went about it the wrong way. In having confronted my friend the way she did, especially that we were there celebrating her birthday was just inappropriate, unprofessional and tactless. And she did this immediately after we had already ordered our food and had opened several bottles of wine. She&#39;s lucky we even opted to stay for the remainder of the night given how nasty of an attitude she had the entire time we were there. <br><br>It&#39;s unfortunate that we had such a bad experience because as soon as I walked in I thought I&#39;d be returning in the future - it&#39;s a cute place, the food and wine was good, and they had live music. But the ambiance that the owner set over our table made it such an unwelcoming experience that not one person from our party will ever return to this place. <br><br>If you plan to come to this place with a big party, don&#39;t do it. It&#39;s not large party friendly and clearly, neither is the owner.	0
Delivery review:<br><br>Ordered the edamame which was cold but I figured this would happen because of the delivery aspect. Vegetable spring rolls were great. The tuna tarter was my favorite it was so delicious with avocado and the tuna was fresh it also comes with two sauces that i drizzled on and I&#39;m not sure what they were but they really added an amazing taste. We also ordered the spicy tuna roll and the Jb tempura roll. I personally loved the Jb tempura roll, it not only was not overly fried but it was not as heavy as you would expect a tempura roll to be. We got the spicy tuna roll as well and I thought it was ok, my bf liked it a lot. Finally we got the cheesecake and Thai donuts both delicious. Definitely a repeat, perfect for a rainy night in. <br><br>The only issue we had was delivery time which was slightly over the time expected but it was also raining so that may have had something to do with it.	1
My all time favorite breakfast place. Every time I&#39;m in town it&#39;s one of my first stops. I always order the same thing, 3 eggs sunny side up with bacon, sourdough toast, and fruit and it&#39;s always just right. You also get so much food for such a reasonable price! I love sitting outside and watching the people and cars go by. It&#39;s so refreshing and is exactly the way I like to experience a meal in LA. The people working there are also generally young and hip and love to make conversation. <br><br>I&#39;ve also been told that the french toast and the eggs benedict are pretty great too.	1
Dropped by for a quick meal that&#39;s near my house and waited 60 minutes to receive my plate of food. Never coming here again. :(	0
This is a horrible place if you're a lazy ass!  How do you go to a "restaurant" and have to get your own utensils and then get your food  when it's called. 	0
Even has vegan chowder!	1
The chicken is awesome! We tried both the spicy (which is PRETTY spicy) and the garlic-soy wings, along with some wedge fries and the radish. Crispy, tasty, awesomeness. And with the $10 Hite pitcher deal they had going the night we went, it definitely hit the spot. Will for sure be coming back!	1
Tries too hard to be a Bougie brunch place but lacks the class and grace required both in service and in menu to meet the criteria. <br><br>Other than the most basic rooftop view of SANTA MONICA. The Roof is nothing more than wannabe upscale fine dining experience that thinks it&#39;s something more just because they top their scrambled eggs with caviar and have a few fancy cocktails under their belt.	0
Before they have the midtown location, I ate a couple times at flushing, I really like their food. However, does the cook at the midtown location understand what&#39;s the difference between mild and spicy!!!!! I ordered three times there, all ask for mild, but they gave me the food even more spicier that my friend&#39;s standard spicy. I had stomached twice because of the too spicy food. Plz be careful with your chili oil, not everyone need it that much!!!	0
The best burger I have ever tasted in my life. Well, so far... I have tried Cali and Truffled both was spectacular.	1
I personally didn&#39;t like their food. I got the cabbage soup and added ramen. I couldn&#39;t even eat it because it tasted so bad. We also got the bimbimbop which is basically rice with vegetables. Not bad but nothing special. <br>I did the the potato pancake. <br>The service was not good. The waiter was nice but 2 people at our table got their food at least 15 min after everyone else and they messed up one of the orders which took another 5 min to fix. <br>We ate in the lobby which is really nice.	0
Great food! We're Italian and the food was outstanding! Large portion and good prices!	1
I visited Morro Castle for the first time in at least 14 years this week. The fritas (Little Cuban Hamburgers) were as good as I ever remembered them. Great food and a malted milk shake all under $10.00.	1
Walked in around lunchtime on a Sunday. Figured there would be a bit of a wait considering my arrival time. Took my number and waited for about 10 minutes before being seated. The interior is cozy and the ambiance is inviting. Staff was friendly and brought us our beverages promptly. We ordered a spider roll, rainbow roll and eel cucumber roll which was brought to us seemingly almost immediately. The spider roll came a little after. Rolls were delicious and fresh-tasting. Great quality and a great overall experience. Will definitely be coming back!	1
I was really happy to learn that peppe rosso to go would finally open a larger restaurant. Located in a sea of little italy tourist traps, this restaurant is definitely a neighborhood gem. The restaurant provides a simple intimate decor and to be honest for the prices of their pasta, one really can&#39;t complain. We dined as a group of 6 and were easily accommodated. The one dish that you must order is the RIGATONI. If you are on a budget and looking for cheap italian fare that comes with good food and a quaint environment, I&#39;d recommend this place.	1
I&#39;ve been going to The Pantry ever since I can remember. Their sourdough toast is a meal in and of itself and worthy enough to treck 30+ miles just to eat. Everything else is delicious as well. I&#39;ve only ever eaten breakfast at the Pantry, but the lunch/dinner items sound and look good too. They&#39;ve been open for a very long time and never ever close. To be honest, I don&#39;t even know if there are locks on the doors.<br><br>There&#39;s always a line, especially weekend mornings, so be prepared to wait outside for while before eating. Fortunately, service is really fast, so things move along quickly and smoothly. The Pantry is truly a Downtown LA staple. It may not be the fanciest or healthiest place to eat, but this place has major staying power. I promise you&#39;ll be full for the rest of the day.	1
All I ever get here are the chicken fajitas and those are fairly hard to screw up. Anything else I've tired here has been sub-par. Really, the best thing about this place is the freshly-made tortillas.	0
We really enjoyed Demetris in Edmonds! The food was great and atmosphere was busy. Although busy we were impressed with the service. Good to see a good tapas place in Snohomish County.	1
I can&#39;t stop thinking about their perfect pulled pork sandwich.. everything about it was so good..from the WW wrap, the the FAT CHUNK free tender pork, to the amazing slaw and the spicy green salsa.... can&#39;t wait to have it again... <br>only negative is that their kebab pita meat content was minimal : /	1
We had a great meal and a very good bottle of wine. Our waitress very attentive to our needs	1
I&#39;ve been to OxCart several times and have reviewed it in the past. I still love the atmosphere and think it&#39;s a great addition to the neighborhood. The turkey burger has been consistently excellent, as had the LaVaca burger until today.<br>On tonight&#39;s outing, the service was less than friendly and the hamburger we ordered &#34;medium&#34; arrived overcooked. We sent it back - it took around 20 minutes until we got the new one - and it was also overcooked and dry. Also, the french fries had been redunked in oil so they were overcooked and not fresh. When we let the waiter know, he didn&#39;t seem to care that much and we felt like they could have done more to try and compensate.	0
I waited a couple of weeks to write this review. In the meantime, I had the opportunity to eat ramen at several other restaurants in the City and in the East Bay. All of them were better than the shoyu ramen I had at Suzu. Ok, let me back up...I have been to Suzu dozens of times and enjoyed the food each time. However, on Monday, June 2, I had the worst ramen ever. The broth in the past was a 9 out of 10 has dropped to 0, yes, zero! It was brown, hot water, absolutely no flavor. I don't send food back but I had to. I was convinced the cook forgot to put some ingredients into the broth. The same "brown" water came back. I spoke to the waitress, the cook and everyone was just shaking their heads. The cook said he would talk to the manager upon his return. Whaaaat? They did not offer to remove the ramen from my bill. I literally could not eat it. So, I paid and left. I don't think I'll be returning anytime soon unless I hear they have a new cook. I have been eating at Suzu since they opened and have waited in line for a seat numerous times. The ramen, especially the broth used to be one of the best I've tasted...not anymore!!	0
20 or so white linen tables well equipped bar excellent service. I had the lamb chops wedge salad lentils and a spicy carrot pure9e. Delicious I would return weekly if I didn't live 6 hours away. Love it.	1
The service here was amazing. After bringing out the first course on Easter, my date and I informed the waitress that although we weren&#39;t kosher, we&#39;d already ordered the ham, we were trying to keep Passover by not eating bread... The waitress happily replied no worries and she proceeded to bring out everything pretzel baked matza to gafilta fish to matzah ball soup... None of which was on the menu that night... Moreover, they ended up hooking me up with brisket instead of the ham and when I off handedly mentioned I would have Liked to try the ham, the waitress offered to bring some out for me<br>Food was very fresh and ambiance was great, the staff went above and beyond beyond.	1
I went there for a quick lunch break alone, I sat on the bar and ate 2 slices of fresh pizza.. it was heaven. <br>Delicious, fresh and friendly atmosphere.	1
Our server Carlos was very well trained and courteous. He recommended us with excellence. We had the nikei ceviche and the olivo causa to start. Both very good and fresh. Then we had the octopus anticucho which was amazing and the chaufa aeropuerto. The chaufa is very good but big, for 2 or 3. We couldnt fit a dessert into the equation. To drink we had pisco sours, my dissapointment as after the second one I was still sober. Had to ask for a stronger third one. Very well recommend this place.	1
Simple and delicious food. The flavors were really good. I like the retro feel.I had the beef sandwich with the horseradish sauce, mushrooms and cheese. It was very, very tasty. The fries just okay for me but the bbq sauce in the dining area saved it. The strawberry shake was pretty good. I'd definitely come back.	1
One of the best pizzas I&#39;ve had in LA! I was skeptical at first but that quickly went out the window. All the ingredients are fresh and you can really taste the flavor palette in every bite. I&#39;m a total fan	1
The yakitori here is unique to Miami, but having had yakitori in other large metropolitans in the US, it does not even compare. The place is decorated really nicely but the food is not out of the world spectacular, especially for the prices. I would recommend only coming here to try something &#34;unique&#34; if you&#39;ve never had it, but if you&#39;re hungry you will pay an arm and a leg to get full.	0
Butchers and Barbers has pampered us to the fullest! The service is absolutely wonderful, and the food was just amazing. Let me explain the pork chop we had was cooked to perfection, succulent and melt in your mouth tender pork. The beats with quinoa was perfect that ricotta cheese with beats was just inviting. The pig ears reminded me of Mexico, of course they needed to be a little crispier for my tasting, but I understand what the chef had in mind while preparing this dish. I would definitely recommended Butchers and Barbers to friends and family.	1
Don&#39;t ever come here!! The food is amazing, but it&#39;s not worth the terrible service. I have come here with friends about 8 times, hoping each time the service will be better, but no luck. I once waited an hour and 23 minutes for my food. It has become a game for us, how long will it take for a draft beer to come to our table? 32 minutes!! I ordered a steak one night, and was still working on it when the waitress picked it up to take it away. I told her I was not done, and she held the plate for me to eat it out of her hand! I finished my steak with her holding it for me, and she stormed off as if I was an inconvenience for her. Another time we told them we had a group of about 12 people coming, and I was told we are not allowed to have more than 6 people. I looked in the dining room and there was noone in there. I asked if we could push some tables together for our large group and they said no. It&#39;s such a shame because their food is amazing and their signature cocktails are delicious. Unfortunately, I will not be going back again.	0
Sorry, but the fried chicken has nothing on the Front Porch! Our server was great but we had a food runner that was insanely rude. She made giving us attitude an art. Granted, the place is so loud and poorly located that I kind of forgive her. Overall, the drinks and food were good and the atmosphere is fun but don't believe the hype.	0
Went to West of Pecos last night and left very underwhelmed. I've been there in the past, maybe a year ago, and the food was super tasty. But last night...it just wasn't. The service was slow as well. Margaritas were mediocre. They've got so much potential, hope they can find they're groove again.	0
What a great night at Five Sails! I was so impressed on how the restaurant had kept a record of my allergies from last year. This restaurant is a must go once in a life time. The food was amazing!!!! I especially love their duck; however, the portion can be a bit bigger. The service is excellent!!!! Looking forward to next time :)	0
Had a nice meal at Next Door the other night. This was my second time there, my first time was just for a beer shortly after they opened so I wanted to get back in and check it out.	0
I have been to Canter's at least 6 times in my life. Whenever my family and I are in the area, we always make a point of trying to go there. I'm trying to stay away from red meat and Canters' turkey burger is the best I've had. Barney's in Los Angeles is a far second. I've been to a lot of other places and ordered the turkey burger just to compare it to Canter's and none come close. They all taste like sausage.	1
Great stuff.	1
A good brunch and lunch stop in a great location. I&#39;ve been coming for years. Avoid going on Sundays as the line/wait is insane. There are a few couches inside, which is a nice spot to dine. The salads are consistently delicious, and I like that they serve breakfast all day. I love their sweet potato fries, although they have been burnt a few times. However, the staff is always nice about correcting them, refilling drinks, and generally being attentive.	1
After walking up and down 3rd street trying to find somewhere to eat my partner and I stumbled upon this beautiful bar/restaurant.It was rather late so we were worried the kitchen might be closed but our fears were unfounded and were easily sat at a booth inside. It is very dark but the ambience is nice and the waitstaff friendly.We ordered small plates as weren't overly hungry and were not disappointed! The oysters are to die for, extremely fresh and large (Wednesdays they have dollar oysters for those interested), the Spanish Octopus is also great alongside the Pork Meatballs :)The drinks are also delicious and strong- Manhattan is the ticket!A little pricey for what we ordered but the quality of the food is excellent :) Definitely will be coming back.	1
Wonderful meal in a lovely setting on the water in beautiful Rock Hall, Maryland.Kudos to the restaurant to offering a delicous vegetarian/vegan selection to their menu.	0
Some of the bombest burgers in the city.. they&#39;re the no frills type.. just meat, cheese, sauce, fried egg, and a bun... possibly some onion strings but that&#39;s it and it&#39;s pretty killer<br><br>Their mac n cheese is rich and creamy and their fries are salty and crispy.. the perfect complements. <br><br>You could put yourself in a 24 hour food coma if you do all three though.<br><br>I wasn&#39;t too impressed with their bao&#39;s to be honest but that&#39;s not what i&#39;m going there for now that I know how good their burgers are	1
I gave Geraldine's an I like it because I do like it -- for breakfast. I've been to dinner twice however and both times were frankly pretty bad. The second time featured one of the worst hamburgers I've ever had in my life. 	1
Delightful and surprising. Shrimp was cooked to perfection. Gluten and soy free options.	1
I hoped I would love this place but it let us down.<br><br>A friend and I usually go for dinner once a week and like to pick quieter places made for the foodie and wino :)<br><br>This place stood out after we couldn&#39;t get a table at WD-50 but I&#39;m sorry to say it disappointed.<br><br>It started well with nice wine, good bread and good salted butter. <br><br>Appetizers were pretty OK (I had the lobster tail, friend had the bison tartar).<br><br>Mains were disappointing (My lamb was overcooked - not enough to send back but definitely overcooked and overpowered with mint, my friend got the ostrich which he ordered rare and it came out well done - he sent it back while i tried to hold off on eating mine. The second attempt cam out medium well).<br><br>Like I say the wine was great, atmosphere was great but the food did disappoint <br><br>B	0
this place is so cool! cozy little place in the heart of little tokyo...came here on a saturday night and loved the ambiance and FOOD!the wasabi garlic fries and chicken wings are a must try. i've been wanting to come here for happy hour too so expect a review of that in the near future ;)even better part about far bar is it's practically next door to daikokuya. score!	1
Food was good, but I should have checked the menu prices before going. As someone who has eaten tacos for 25 years of my 28 years of existence on planet earth - I&#39;ve never paid five dollars for a single taco, In fact I&#39;ve never even heard of an establishment charging that much, until I walked in, saw the menu and thought - &#34;this must be for 2 tacos&#34;...NOPE! Obvious price gouging, hipster premium tax perhaps? A good taco for $5 doesn&#39;t impress me - make that same taco and make it $3 and you&#39;ve got a winner.	0
Toulouse Petit though! Lol. I came here with my family for happy hour as soon as we landed in Seattle because my uncle recommended it! We ordered a bunch of different appetizers and a couple of drinks!	0
If you like noise, this is the place. Couldn&#39;t even talk to table mates when music was not playing. Reminded me of the noise level of a championship game in a domed stadium after a team has scored. The waitress got two orders wrong since it was so loud.<br>But if you go for the food, it was very mediocre and while not expensive, was overpriced for what they delivered. They do have good beer.	0
let's join the slew of people telling you to go eat here...because it really is just that good.	1
I've been to Eno Vino dozens of times now and it's always the first place that comes to mind when I want to grab an awesome drink or bite to eat. I adore their drinks: The All Natural martini is my go to, but I love the PB&amp;J and Blueberry Cobbler too. My bf and I generally always start with the Ahi Tuna, but recently have moved to their awesome mussels. They change up their menu every so often and I am never disappointed when they do. We went a few days ago and had their duck special and it was AMAZING. I always get the scallops and would happily eat them everyday if I could. Their hanger steak is a must too, the mashed potatoes underneath are awesome. The waitstaff is always very knowledgeable and prompt. We generally finish up with the fondue and I somehow always have enough room to finish it. It's a little spendy but I feel like you get so much amazing food that it's well worth it. The decor and seating is great too. I have no complaints about Eno, I'll be back again soon!	1
I love this place.. There is nowhere else like this place... Might have to wait a very long time but if u pick ur spots it can be no wait... If u go late U have a better chance of not waiting. Food is great and I love this vibe here.. Be warned... U will stink like charcoal at the end of the dinner but it's well worth it.	1
Went on a Sunday around 3 pm. There were only two other parties. By the time our food came, there were two more parties. So obviously there was no wait. The jjajjangmyun noodles were good. my husband got the regular size and I got the small size. We also got the Mongolian beef which was yummy! This is the first chinese-Korean restaurant I&#39;ve been where the Kimchi is made with napa cabbage (the way Koreans like it) rather than with regular cabbage and the first one where I saw radish kimchi served! Cool... The remodeled interior is beautiful. I like the corniced ceiling and lighting cause I actually like to see the food I am eating.	1
This is probably the best Vietnamese sandwich shop I have been to. Their bread is toasted and feels the most fresh. The meats are tasty. Their pickled vegetables are just the right amount of both tangy and sweet. And, as with most sandwich shops of this kind, the price point is nice: $3.75. I can&#39;t complain there. Especially since the sandwich is bigger than most you&#39;d see in New York.<br><br>Note that it closes at 6.30 daily.	1
mmmmm...CARBS.wish my thighs didnt like this place so much.	1
Very upset with their no modifications policy. I totally understand that they don&#39;t want people messing with their food by adding all kinds of crap to their dishes... But if someone (me) has multiple allergies, why the hell can you not take it off of something? Like it is so hard? Like the dish completely suffers because of the cheese? Is this a growing trend in LA- a pompous chef who won&#39;t accommodate their customers? Yup, sure seems so... I love that next to their no substitutions or modifications line is a line that says alert your server to any allergies. Um, what&#39;s the point? You can&#39;t help me anyway. I&#39;m allergic to a variety of things, and unless you have a doctor back in your kitchen, there is no reason I need your help to keep me away from food I very well know I&#39;m allergic to. Sucks too. I wanted to like it there. But the arrogance completely ruined the experience of what could&#39;ve been awesome.	0
THIS PLACE IS RIDICULOUS. YOU SHOULD SUE. <br><br>You can get better chicaron at Manila Oriental or Pacific Super. What is there to &#34;halo&#34; in the Halo-Halo? ..its basically milk &amp; ice! Also, the waiters/waitresses don&#39;t have any knowledge as to what filipino food really is. At lastly, the plates look like it&#39;s from chinatown which doesn&#39;t make the food any more appealing.	0
On my quest for the best L.A. burger, I ventured down to Apple Pan. I am not sure where all the hype for this place comes from because it does not deserve it. The food is OK, the service is terrible, rushed, and inconsiderate. Apparently it is a crime to ask if they make a double cheeseburger (which they will not). My waiter said no to all of my questions before I even finished asking them. I joked with my brother that he should have a &#34;NO&#34; button on the counter so he could just press it at the customers and save his breath, which he obviously did not like to waste. And good luck coming with more than two people, this place is so small and crammed that we saw families having to split up and sit at opposite ends of the counter (which is all this &#34;restaurant&#34; really is, a counter. A counter with SUPER tight seating). It is a struggle to even get in this place, you open the front door and suddenly your standing in the walk-in fridge. Also, if you prefer restaurants that serves food on plates, the Apple Pan probably isn&#39;t for you. Burgers are handed to you wrapped In N&#39; Out Style sans box. Fries come on a small paper plate the size of a small bread plate. <br><br>Pros - The fries are amazing, probably the best I have ever had. They are super clean, hot and crispy....I believe fried to order in very clean oil. The steak burger is OK, but I have had much better &#34;classic style&#34; burgers at countless other places. Daglas Drive-In Burgers in Canoga Park kills this place just to name one. And I would choose a Bob&#39;s Big Boy Double Deck over an Apple Pan Burger any day of the week. <br><br>The Apple Pie w/ Ice Cream is by far the best Diner Style Apple Pie A la Mode i have ever had and is rivaled by none - perfection. <br><br>Cons - I know the little paper cone cup idea is quirky, but it actually makes your beverage difficult to drink! Don&#39;t go to Apple Pan thirsty, because all you can do is sip out of this snow cone. Also only can soda at $1.50 a pop. No fountain - BOOOOOOOOOOOO! Cash only!!! Boooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!	0
My sister and I shared shrimp and lobster tacos along with fresh chips and guacamole. The chips are so warm and fluffy and the guacamole and salsa are really good. I enjoyed the tacos and my favorite were the lobster tacos, but my sisters favorite were the shrimp so it depends what you like the most. We also got a tamale, which are not stuffed. The chicken ( they have other than chicken) is on top on the tamale with sour cream and avocado. They are so delicious and the tamale is so soft and it&#39;s a crazy blend of flavors. I got a cucumber and mint water and it was really good and my sister got watermelon which was equally good. The churos with the homemade chocolate are really good to, they just melt in your mouth. The staff is so friendly, and always checking what you need. Our server was James and he was really nice and attentive and giving us his opinion and he did not let us down. Best place for tacos, hands down!!! The location is perfect and the vibe inside is really relaxing and friendly and the design is really cool and unique!!	1
A vegan or vegetarians paradise. I had the taboulet salad which was very generous in portion size and delicious. The vegetarian white ham in the salad was so tasty and really tasted like ham. So large I had enough leftover for lunch the next day. Really recommend this place.	1
Awesome place with great food and drinks. A little out of the way, but worth it if you&#39;re in the area. My friends had the chicken and short rib burger, which were both delicious. I had the mussels which weren&#39;t the best I&#39;ve had, but certainly good. Also, the dishes were running behind and the manager offered us dessert for free as an apology. That&#39;s all it takes to make me a happy camper!	1
Ok so Ludo and the Animal people got together and Petit Trois is the lovechild.<br>I went with a group of friends and waited patiently for a table because they don&#39;t take reservations. We were a party of 4 and the place is so small that it took a while and other smaller parties were seated before us even tho we were there first. The waiter was very nice and fed us delicious bread and butter while we waited. <br>There were only 5 items on the menu so naturally we tried them all. And both desserts. Everything was excellent with the Steak tartare being the stand out dish (I normally hate steak tartare but this one was sweet and tangy and didn&#39;t taste at all like steak) and the Napoleon dessert. <br>The only thing we didn&#39;t get was the Croque Monsieur because it&#39;s only served after 10!	1
Satisfied my hunger. But even my hunger could not ignore how poorly prepared my vegetarian noodles were. It&#39;s noodles. I&#39;m Asian. It ain&#39;t that hard. Not worth over $5.99 but I paid $12.00. Noodles were sticky and seasoning stuck together.	0
Nothing better than fresh Italian meats and a great wine selection. Highly recommend D&#39;Oro when looking for a quick bite of fresh Italian cold cuts. Very friendly and attentive staff to make the experience even better.	1
2.5 stars<br><br>I&#39;m a brisket fanatic. This brisket was really disappointing, especially since it was the first thing our server recommended so I assumed it would be great. It was pretty tender, but it lacked the smoke and flavor that makes good brisket. You can get better brisket at Blue Smoke in Manhattan, and hear really good jazz while you&#39;re at it.<br><br>We also ordered cheeseburger sliders which were fine, fried green tomatoes (fine), fries (fine) and mini-wedge salad (hard to screw up but they added BBQ to the blue cheese dressing and personally, I&#39;d stick with regular blue cheese). As for their sauces, I tried 2/3 and must admit that even as a novice cook, I&#39;ve made tastier BBQ sauce at home. The habanero wasn&#39;t spicy. The regular wasn&#39;t sweet or tangy. <br><br>This was much more of a corporate chain restaurant experience, not down-home authentic BBQ. It reminded me of Claim Jumper, which is significant, I think. The restaurant itself is huge by New York standards, and you feel instantly transported to the suburbs. On the way out, we noticed another BBQ place across the street, so it appeared suspicious that Dino chose that location - typical corporate restaurant maneuver. Think about all the Starbucks that open up next to independent coffee shops. It&#39;s not an accident.<br><br>Dinosaur BBQ was much-hyped, but afterward I just felt greasy and had an upset stomach. Like I was about to give birth to a stegosaurus. Just enjoy that mental image for a moment before you decide to give this place a shot.	0
This is a great place without the pretense. It would not surprise me if they served blowfish to distinguished guests. I asked and they said it&#39;s illegal in California go to New York. Shucks, was in that kind of mood last night...<br><br>Back to the sushi: very big sashimi portions. Do yourself a favor and start with the sashimi and see if you have room for more. If not take a break, have some sake, beer, air, whatever and then dive in for more. Reasonable pricing for the portions. Two people with hearty appetites can be in and out for $80 with two tall Sapporos.	1
I would give the food and ambiance a 5 star. Service was definitely a 2-3 star...typical of K-town. <br>Had the Redondo combo which was a good price for what we got. Medium spice (holy sauce) was perfect for our taste. Definitely spicy, but not crying over our food. <br><br>The service was sub-par. You need to do a dance around your table to get the wait staff to come by. And their English was more than questionable. <br>However, the food is definitely good. We went at 6:30 on a Saturday and only needed to wait 5 min. The place is full, but not over-crowded. <br>SO, if you want some good seafood, minimal wait, and don&#39;t mind barely, ok service. Go for it! We&#39;ll go back as we live in Ktown, liked the food, and are completely used to this type of service.	1
Westward is awesome. We had our name down at another oyster bar that I really love (see other reviews) and it was going to be over almost an hour wait so we decided to drive over to check out this place.	0
Dammit. It&#39;s pretty good. <br><br>I am an omnivore, so no Vegalitarian judgements here. It&#39;s just plain tasty. They&#39;ve got a spot at the tiny little farmer&#39;s market a block over from my apartment and I&#39;m starting to become a frequent buyer. It&#39;s got to stop though. I end up spending meals&#39; worths of money on side dishes that I pretend I will nibble on for the rest of the week. Usually I&#39;ve gobbled up the whole container by evening. My gullet is so greedy. So far I&#39;ve tried the Tempeh, Seaweed Salad, and Spicy Daikon. All great. <br><br>I motion to have a Fan Club promotion. Buy 5 get 1 free or some sort. Yeah yeah? Give us po&#39; peeps some love, Dave!	1
1. Wide array of wine selection<br>2. Excellent display of cheese etc<br>3. Friendly and knowledgeable staff<br>4. Try sitting facing Melrose- it&#39;s like watching National Geographic.<br>5. Be merry while there!	1
If you love perfection, Center Cut is the place to go for steak and  prime rib.  They are a steak house only.  You can get turf with your meat, but this is a true steak house whose main focus is the beef. The Trio of Bacon appetizer is a creative and taste sensation.  I am still dreaming about the best Oysters Rockefeller I have ever had.   It is pricey, but it is worth every penny.	1
Had brunch there and thought the food was not that good. The potatoes were extremely greasy the bacon was over cooked and the bread had way to much cheese. Had reservations and was seated in the bar.	0
Now that summer has officially started The Roof has some new menu items to get you in the sprit! Chef Greenspan is at it again! Starting with fresh Baja style tempura fried fresh Red Snapper fish tacos! Served with a nice cold beer and some limes I am in heaven! Also have a beer tenderloin and lamb shank with mole reduction. This places is getting busier by the day so make sure you make reservations for some good food, fun, and fantastic 180 degree views of LA!	1
Full disclosure, owned by personal friends. That said, I know how much thought went into this place and it shows. The best cheese curds in town, which should put them high in the running for best cheese curds in the universe. The Lazy Susans are a great sconnie take on meze. Egg-topped buger was fantastic. This was my first liquid old fashioned experience. They are tasty and come in various permutatations, the table favorite was made with applejack. Ho-maid ice cream an excellent finish, recomend the buttered beer nut. Lactose intolerants, veg, maybe vegans can find something.	0
What a nice surprise. Like some of the other reviews, I expected the food to be bland and boring, but was very well pleased with the quality and flavors. The food was not as heavy and overly filling and they would be at a non-healthy authentic restaurant. We ordered the "spicy seafood rice noodle soup", "half and half beef and pepperoni pizza" and the "seafood risotto". Everything was good, tasted authentic was delish. I forgot it was healthy food.I agree that the atmosphere is nice. It is pleasant, airy and does have a clean healthy feel. I felt like I was @ a restaurant in South OC.Overall, I was impressed. I don't normally do healthy, but will definitely recommend and come back here.	1
I've been here a few times now and have received excellent service each time.Fantastic little cafe with delicious food and friendly wait staff.Inside the atmosphere is very cute and a great little escape if you want to treat yourself to solo brunch and a novel.I recommend anything with eggs, their guacamole is amazing and the Red Velvet Cupcakes are to die for.	1
I am not big on writing reviews, but I felt compelled to write after my experience tonight at Marlow and Sons.<br><br>I will preface by saying that the food was delicious and inventive. That being said, the service and overall experience truly let the place down. I was taking my mother, who was visiting New York, out for dinner and it was unfortunate that the evening had to be tainted by poor service. <br><br>When our mains arrived, one (the fish) was completely cold, and the other was lukewarm at best. I was extremely hungry and so overlooked the fact that mine was lukewarm, but we sent the other back as it was just unenjoyable. <br><br>Afraid that my dish was going to get even colder, I picked at it trying to stall until the second dish returned. By the time it returned I had reached the final stages of my meal. The waitress was unapologetic, and seemed to have no concern over the fact that their mistake meant that we were each eating our meals alone. The whole dining experience was thrown off. One expects better service considering the prices. No efforts were made to compensate for the mistake.	0
This is a truly classic burger joint. Many have tried to be the Apple Pan but there is only one. The hickory burger with cheese is amazing! It is easy to decide what you want because they only make a few things but they are all top notch! The fast service grantees the hottest burger and the freshest fries on town. Don&#39;t forget to save room for a piece of their home made pie!	1
When I first moved into the neighborhood two years ago these subs were awesome.	0
The quail and waffle cup was amazing! They have a pretty good whiskey selection too. I recommend the combination.	1
How can I not give 5 stars to a place with amazing choices of beer & a far too good choice in burger selection. I was hesitant on whether I should go for the Far Bar Burger or the Italian Samurai Burger. Mmm, they both sounded too good to be true. I ended up getting an Italian Samurai Burger with a side of cold beer (Golden Road Hefeweizen). If you like hefe, I would definitely recommend you try that one. I was pleased with my end result. They have happy hour from Tuesday - Friday: 4-7 and Sunday - Monday: 4 - Close. They had a little selection of sides to order on the happy hour menu, and I said heck, why not try the wasabi fries. NO... Do not get it. I had one, with just a small tiny bit of wasabi and it was burning in my nostrils I wanted to throw up. Besides the nasty fries we got, the happy hour selection is really nice. I went ahead and tried the hoppy. I am not a big fan of IPA, but the 4 he selected were just in my taste bud. I can't remember exactly what they were, but I'm sure whatever the bartender gives you will be just right.Ps. The restaurant is hidden in some alley way with just a small sign saying "Far Bar Entrance", so be on the look out for that if you are having a hard time finding the place.	1
While I am not one to make the same mistake twice when selecting a dining location, I was roped into a recent return. The first observation which sent my radar on alert was that our waitress was responsible for about half of the restaurant's tables. While her demeanor was happy and professional, there were a number of problems. One of the diners in our party was given the wrong soup and dressing on the salad (she had asked for it on the side-it was served drenched). She ended up waiting until the rest of us were 3/4s of the way finished. My order was called brisket hash, and the concept was underwhelming. The meat was cut up into rectangular pieces that reminded me of how some overbearing mother would cut up their child's food, rather than the traditional consistency of breakfast hash. The plate was unusually hotter than the food, which made me wonder if a microwave was used to rescue an unattended plate. Another diner at the table had asked for egg whites and were given regular eggs, resulting in another delay. The fault here lies not with the server, but the management, for not properly staffing their restaurant on a Sunday at noon.	1
If you are willing to drive distances to try out a great hole in the wall, then put Mama Maria&#39;s on your list of places to try. Someone told me about this place a few weeks ago and have been wanting to go since. We finally made the trip way out to the Northeast and were rewarded with fantastic food, reasonable prices, and friendly service. <br><br>After debating between several items, we decided to order the chile verde, enchiladas verdes, and a chile relleno a la carte. The chile verde ($8.50) consisted of tender pieces of slow cooked pork bathed in a tangy tomatillo sauce, and was served with a side of fluffy rice and refried beans that tasted identical to those we had at a little lobster village in Mexico. The pork was fork tender and I loved the large meaty chunks, but I would have preferred it to have a few more hot chiles. The chile relleno ($5.50 a la carte) was also worth the trip and we even thought it was better than that of Vega&#39;s cafe, which previously held our number one spot for this dish. Rather than a white sauce, this was served with a perfectly executed red tomato-based sauce. The batter was thicker and had a good amount of egg, and there wasn&#39;t a superfluous amount of cheese in the center. The combination of these two factors pleased me because it resulted in more protein, less fat, and a more interesting flavor combination. It just felt like a more balanced dish than the other chile rellenos I&#39;ve had. The enchiladas verdes ($8.99) were the least impressive dish, but still better than enchiladas at most other restaurants. I appreciated how the green sauce for these was different than the chile verde sauce used for the pork, because it showed me that each dish is thought of independently. My husband commented on the skill used to prepare the sauces here as they weren&#39;t broken (culinary term meaning the fat and acids haven&#39;t separated from one another), and I agreed. Even though the food here could be equated with awesome home cooking, the skill level necessary to prepare each of these is probably underrated in the eyes of the consumer. I really wanted the tres leches cake since that is on my top five list of favorite desserts (the best I&#39;ve had is at Cuba Cuba in Richmond, VA), but sadly they were out so we settled for the flan ($2.50). This turned out not to be sad at all, because despite the weird presentation with plastic covered toothpicks, the flan itself was creamy and the caramelized sugar syrup was toasty and rich. Plus, it was the perfect size. If you don&#39;t want to try the desserts here, however, you can go to the shop next door to get homemade ice creams and popsicles, which are also inexpensive.<br><br>Though I&#39;ve only been once, it seems like the food here would be fairly consistent since it&#39;s run by a couple from Guadalajara who manage the restaurant and do all the cooking, just like at Vega&#39;s cafe. Adding to the charm is the old fashioned diner wheel system for reading restaurant tickets, a refreshing sight in a country whose restaurants are filled with P.O.S (point of sale) systems. Plus, it&#39;s always great to support a Mom and Pop kind of place!	1
Horrible. I called in to get a pizza delivered and the guy on the phone told me that I live really close and that I should pick it up myself. I thought he was joking, well that wasn&#39;t the case. I quickly found out he wasn&#39;t. If that&#39;s not enough, after picking the pizza up myself because my hunger was greater than my pride, the sauce was ridiculously sweet! Maybe that&#39;s their thing, but that isn&#39;t the kind of pizza I&#39;m looking for. <br><br>The pizza I can see some people liking, especially drunk...but the customer service is awful! I won&#39;t go back. I found Evio&#39;s which is way better and they are so much nicer there as well. I don&#39;t mind spending my money there.	0
Sweet staff, good food.	1
Any place that you can get Eggs Benedict six different ways at 3am and sells the most amazing hamentashen ever gets five stars from me!	1
Awful service, mediocre burgers and bad experience. If the service was better, i'd be all for it. However such an unfriendly staff makes the whole experience awful	0
By far one of the best most juiciest and gratifying burgers. The only thing is the burger makes you want a second. The original ramen burger is good. The garlic and seaweed fries are good not all that grand, but the burger is the go to thing. The you can't come to la and not try it kinda thing.	1
So I am offically popping my yelp cherry with this review...I came here last Saturday for a friedns birthday celebration. Showed up around 9:30 (right before the line formed) It is surprising placed on the rooftop of a building in Pershing Square. After a trip up two "vintage" elevators the doors opened and we were in a parisian rooftop bistro. Being a lover of Los Angeles and everything it has to offer, I was floored by the beautiful architecture and 360 degree views. The layout is an open floor plan with plenty of lounge seating. I rated this place 4stars versus 5stars because of the restroom availability on the 15th floor, mainly because there was a private party on the 16th floor and the bar clientel had to share the restroom with a wedding reception (sloppily drunk wedding guests @10pm is not my cup of tea) Besides that this place is amazing and definately a MUST SEE!	1
OK; simply put, this place is AMAZING. You are taken away by the ambiance. You are completely unaware that you&#39;re still in LA. There is no signage on the outside of the building to make it feel even more secluded. The food is amazing. We went with a group of 10, so we got to sample pretty much everything. (duck, duck ravioli, scallops, chicken breast &amp; the fillet mignon) it is well worth the price. this may not be the first date kind of place, but certainly anniversary, birthday, second date kind of place. It is definitely a &#34;must see&#34; in LA.	1
The food was excellent and our experience would have been a wonderful one until we received our over charge check. Not only did our server charged us for an extra item (clam) which was resolved as a reprint of our check. The second check we received also had an error of charging us with an octopus plate which wasn't available for the night. My card was charged with two incorrect transactions that resulted in a phone call from the bank then calling the restaurant twice. The situation wasn't handled professionally nor did the manager provide any compensation for the inconvenience. 	0
Just making sure people in this area are aware of this gem. Top shelf! Spring mountain now extends to buffalo and flamingo. Highest endorsement.	1
We have lived in the area for over a year and Bloom has been on my list to try - but the reviews were always mixed, so I had been putting it off. Well - we finally popped in for dinner last week and were SO impressed! The atmosphere, food, and service were totally 5-stars! The hubby had the lamb burger and I had the salmon bowl (at the suggestion of our waitress) and holy god - the salmon bowl seriously blew my mind and my hubs was way happy w/ his as well. And we shared one of the smoothies for dessert and this was also TOPS. An added bonus for me was that my iced tea cup was NEVER empty! I am the thirstiest person alive and was very pleased to always have a full cup. The slightest smallest negative comment I have is that it was a bit chilly inside. But that could have easily been me and my 100 cups of iced tea - ha ha. We took a look at the breakfast menu and it's full of yummy items. We cannot wait to come back to try more off their menu (although - to be honest, it will be difficult to do something other than the salmon bowl).And if all of what I have already written doesn't sell you - they offer BYOB with NO corkage! It doesn't get better than that in my book. Now that we know - we'll definitely be showing up with a bottle or two.	1
I really enjoyed my experience here and opted to give a more generous rating since the restaurant is new and I felt the food showed promise. In addition, I think it&#39;s important to note that we ordered from the prix fixe menu, which, at some other establishments, results in a scrimp on quality with the reduced price. I felt that Da Claudio delivered solid meals with ample portions even for their prix fixe menu. The choices were very limited, but I felt they did them well. We had the lasagnette and the chickien scallopini. The chicken was not drenched in sauce (that&#39;s a plus in my book) and I have just about never ordered lasagna at a restaurant of my own accord, but since we were going with two out of three choices and the only other thing was clams, we opted for the lasagnette. I was satisfied with chicken and was pleasantly surprised by the lasagnette. I was also surprised to have some roasted fennel on my plate- that certainly contributed to my desire to bump up the rating. <br><br>The bread served prior to the meal was good and there was a nice selection, but I did note that it came to us cold. A mark of a detail-oriented management ensures that the bread comes out warm. A small detail but one that we noticed. I did however, like the clever olive oil spread that was served with it. <br><br>Dessert was tiramisu- with the special menu, you only get one choice of dessert, but again, I was satisfied and happy with the choice. <br><br>Small drawback for me personally was the ambiance- while it was nice enough, I felt it could have a bit more charm, and I kind of relate to what another reviewer said about it seeming like an upscale cafeteria. For the prices on the menu, a more refined decor and set-up would have matched a little better. <br><br>We found the service to be attentive - our water glasses were filled regularly and we were checked on an appropriate number of times without feeling like we were being hounded. No complaints there. <br><br>I definitely feel like this place has promise.	1
We walked in Sunday evening and were immediately seated. The room was lit with candles and low lighting. It has a very romantic feel which was perfect for a date night. It had a bit of whimsy, too with the floor lined with pennies and one of the walls plastered with signed menus from other restaurants. Our server was very friendly and treated us very well throughout the night which I appreciated.	0
This was just awful.<br><br>The parking lot is tiny, it&#39;s in a dingy strip mall, and the interior looks extremely outdated. Sitting inside depressed me.<br><br>I had the worst chicken curry I have ever had here. Three chicken bits (bones, skin and all) and half a potato plunked carelessly down on a bland, tastless goop of curry. There wasn&#39;t enough curry to even cover the chicken! The waiter pointed out that this dish was spicy, but I found it to be completely flavorless. I also didn&#39;t like that they don&#39;t serve brown rice, only white.<br><br>2 stars because my coworkers really liked their garlic shrimp.	0
The food is very mediocre. The wait is often long, even if you get a table quickly the service and food tends to be slow. Their fish fry is greasy and boring, the rest of the menu items are sometimes decent, but overpriced. This place survives on its' reputation and the fact that some people don't like food that tastes like anything.	0
7/7/13<br><br>A plane crash at San Francisco Airport forced us to stay an extra day in Vegas. After we checked out of Mandalay Bay and had our luggage stored, we walked around and stumbled into the Four Seasons, which is encapsulated around the Mandalay ground. Their pool is right next to the Mandalay Beach separated by partition.<br><br>So we were killing time until it was time head back to McCarran.<br><br>PRESS is a lounge overlooking the pool area. It consists of a full bar and a coffee/espresso stand. You can make purchase of coffee/tea and pastries and sit at the lounge, or order cocktails from the bartender. PRESS have plug-ins to recharge your iPhone and iPod dock. There&#39;s complimentary wifi. We split our time between the cozy indoor lounge and the poolside wicker chairs outside. It&#39;s perfect for catching up with friends or just chilling, reading a book.<br><br>A cosmopolitan is just $12 here---yes, at the Four Seasons and service is impeccable. They turned on the mist outside and parts of the section have cushioned booths that sit up to 10. It&#39;s a gorgeous beautiful place hidden away from the Strip. I&#39;ll definitely return for drinks in the future.	1
Today&#39;s visit was terribly disappointing. The service was just unforgivable, and it really didn&#39;t need to be.<br><br>First, our server brought us cold coffee, which is odd but like no big deal. She was really busy too. It seemed like all of her tables were leaving at the same time. She was super frazzled, so it&#39;s like yeah, just bring fresh coffee whenever. But it seems like she just gave up on us after the coffee. Her tables left and she starting doing her side work, totally ignoring our table. She never came back to our table for condiments, milk for the coffee, to see if everything was cool. Plus, even though I totally understand things get stressful and busy, I witnessed her being quite ugly to another staff member. I overheard her complaining about the Scoutmob deal that everyone was using (um, hello! It&#39;s obviously bringing in biz if all your tables are using it!) Someone needs to let her know that serving isn&#39;t her calling. <br><br>Sad to say, probably will not be returning. The food is good, but not good enough to endure something that painfully awkward again.	0
Review #840! I can't say Lola is a Greek restaurant, more of a Greek-ish restaurant but it is quite good. The ingredients were perfectly fresh as in the other Tom Douglas joints but the flavors weren't quite as bold as I've liked in other Greek eateries. We had pita with assorted spreads- very nice but have to order more pita, what they bring is quite stingy, Seafood Tagine- nice fennel-y seafood in broth, Seared Chicken, Greek salad which was large and fresh but needed a higher proportion of kalamata olives and Squid Kebabs- must order! I will go back just to order this: spicy, sizzley, squiddy.  Mmmm.	0
After a night out and trying to find a good Raman place that was still open, we ended up at Tatsu (closes at 3am!). It&#39;s one of the more fancy Raman places I&#39;ve tried. You literally order your food on iPads stationed at the entrance and have the choice to pay there, get the receipt, wait to be seated and have your order brought out to you. The process was different and entertaining to do.<br><br>The waiters were nice and it all seems like a great place to eat until the food actually arrived. The presentation was okay just like every other Raman, just less of it. And for 10-12 dollars a bowl I&#39;d expect to have something other than just an egg in my bowl. The broth was plain with regular noodles! I also got the chashu rice bowl which came with a sprinkling of dried beef on top, not even kidding.<br><br>I really wanted to enjoy this place and hoped it could have been one of my late night eatery but the food was so mediocre. If you have ever tried any other Raman place, you&#39;d most likely avoid this one after trying it once. The only thing that saved it was the service and the to-go box and bag, it was cute.	0
a terrible experience. <br><br>I ordered the baked eggs. in any restaurant you go to, the eggs come runny with a soft yolk. my order came out (after 40 minutes) with three eggs, one with a medium cooked yolk, two that had hard yolks. I asked our server if this is the way it really comes out and he said yes. I told him I thought they would be runny since that&#39;s how most baked eggs dishes come out. he said if that&#39;s how I wanted it, I&#39;d need to specify when ordering and if I want it that way, to just say. I told him I&#39;d prefer runny yolks and asked for my dish to be remade. the yolks were so hard and even the whites were hard and dried out in some areas, pretty unappetizing. he said if I wanted the order remade I&#39;d have to pay for it. what? it&#39;s $9. it wont break your effing back to remake my egg dish. no freakin baked egg dish, unless its a frittata, is made so that it&#39;s completely set. it left a really bad taste in my mouth. the server never came by to ask how we were doing and he avoided my eye contact all night.<br><br>I ended up not even touching the dish because it was difficult to get past the hardened texture. he didn&#39;t even offer to comp my bill for the misunderstanding. <br><br>I will never visit this establishment ever again. poor service and extremely mediocre food. nobody at my table was impressed.	0
This review is weird... it started off as a three star review that has become a 5 star review... i couldn&#39;t edit out all my initial comments but.. here goes.. Loved the ambiance and manager was very nice for letting us in early for drinks since our reservation was made on open table where they hadn&#39;t updated the new opening hours. My bff was raving about the nitrogen cocktails she had read about online. She got the diamonds are forever and i got the buddhalicious... omg... the thing tasted like cough syrup initially.. . literally... i think the bartenders agreed actually.... anyway.... all in all the restaurant seemed to be more about presentation than quality... if ur looking for a place to take pictures... imagine disneyland... with no rides.... then ur in the right place... took some nice pics of my cough syrup but I&#39;d even have Dimetapp over the buddhaDisgusting anyday... mac n cheese was heavenly... luv luved it...Made w cheddar you can taste.. def come for the food... <br>update hostess and manager were very nice... manager was pretty awesome... came by and switched out the drink for me... probably update the drink too tho bff stopped me from describing it as cough syrup... But new drink tasted much better.. really good actually... diamonds drink wasnt bad either.. update to 5 stars...they brought around super cute bagel looking bread! Definitely coming back!	1
I love you, Toast. You are local, courteous, and perceptive. I don't think there is a single bad item on the menu. The staff are outstanding. You will love this place. Tons of beautiful people eating all around.Go Toast!!	1
Terrible service!! But great food. Appetizers came after entrees. Asked to cancel it but they said no bc it was almost done. Charged me for it anyways. Ugh. Coulda been 5 star but put me in such a bad mood bc they didn&#39;t really seem remorseful after all their mistakes. Whatever. If you eat here order takeout.	0
Omg! Love this place!!! Everything is sooo yummy!! Corn on a cob, k bbq taco, raw fish taco, maple chicken taco, and shrimp&pork shumai taco, & duck fat fries!!!!! Soooo good!!! And the highlight is michillada beer!!!! Sooo refreshing!!!!	1
Stopped by for a quick bite of something different. <br>Yummy home cooking at it&#39;s best! <br>Had three types of gorditas and fideo soup. Soup just like grandma&#39;s... ;-)<br>Gorditas are made of wheat flour and they are nice, thin, stuffed with the filling of your choice. :-)<br>The Horchata was just as good. Wish I had a bigger stomach for more than three!	1
Kind of heartbroken over the changes here - so much less comfortable, cozy and neighborhoody. Agree with the other reviewer who said it feels more commercial. New chef not as good as the previous one, either. The turkey burger used to be unbelievably good - think it&#39;s still the same basic recipe but was overcooked, cheese practically burnt, and it came on some kind of bizarre bright yellow bun that was frankly disgusting. The new hightop tables and booths are super uncomfortable, and I saw some older regulars giving them the side-eye, not so happy that they would have to climb up there instead of just sitting at a table. Another West Village favorite ruined.	0
I will make this quick. The food was beyond reproach. The server gave us some great suggestions and the atmosphere was great.	1
Authentic Taiwanese boba milk tea. Best place to get it in Miami. The ratio of tea to milk to sugar is perfect. The large size was $6 which is not bad. Oh and they have a chocolate flavor milk tea which you never see!!<br><br>The sandwich was very good as well, excellent flavor.	1
hmm, idunno why Perch only rates an average of 3.5. I'd say more like a 4. My friends and I were walking around downtown in search of a venue that had no cover, yet was still open at 1am. Thankfully, my friend knew downtown pretty well enough to know that Perch was one such place. The fact that we'd have to take an elevator up to the lounge was pretty cool, instantly brought back memories of Vegas lol while waiting for the second elevator, there was a cool, old-school piano and we were playing it as if no one was there :DOnce we were on the top floor, I was amazed with the room and the patio area in the back. And the view!! I was definitely in love, and this was even before bday shots and stuff! I definitely felt like it was an 'SF meets LA'-type of deal, which for me, is the best of both worlds!A friend of mine got me a bday drink (aww he's so sweet lol), and we went outside to sit on some chairs while admiring the breathtaking view of downtown. My other friends were sitting near a fireplace, which I didn't get to see, but I guess there is a fireplace on the rooftop!I didn't really pay much attention to the crowd around us, but the noise level around us was pretty average. The DJ was in the room so we were able to make conversation in the patio area (this is important to me since one of my pet peeves is attempting to talk over noise, which I cannot do that well and then the other person keeps going 'huh?' and like leaning in awkwardly...ugh :)The drinks were pretty good! Not sure which bday shot my friend got me but it was tropical and pretty to look at. Meanwhile, the cranberry vodka (my fav) my guy friend got me was average (I mean, how different can other cranberry vodkas be from one another? lol).At the end during closing, the bouncers could've been a little more nice and professional, but all in all we had a great time considering it was the last venue we went to for the night. It was a good way to end the night. I would definitely go back and stay longer!	1
WHOA! I didn't see that coming! They're food is good! I got some tacos and my friend the noodle salad. It's filling and delicious! Go here!	1
I dont usually do this.. But one bartender sure doesn&#39;t know how to deal with guests she just met for the first time. <br>Found a hair in my chicken sandwich that actually landed in my mouth.. smh. and the sandwich itself was a waste of my money. The Beer was great though no thanks to the establishment of course.	0
Another AYCE, yes.I like this place. Their salad is good, their service one of the friendliest.Meat quality above average.	1
Ordered Panang curry and the chicken was raw.<br><br>The taste of the curry was amazing until I got to my first bite of pink rubbery chicken then I had to hold back my vomit....<br><br>If the chicken had been thoroughly cooked it probably would&#39;ve been perfect. I would just rather not risk that experience again or bother risking salmonella/food poisoning. <br><br>I won&#39;t be back to say the least. If they make sure their meats are thoroughly cooked I&#39;m sure it tastes great. Just a risk you gotta take I suppose. I just personally can&#39;t stomach raw chicken.<br><br>Good luck.	0
My experience with this place is no bueno. Serving up an underdone sausage. And the cook had the nerve to tell me that there was nothing wrong it the meat. The center was totally cold while the outside was chard. Gross meat &amp; service.	0
Mmmmm. Really good pizza. The funghetto pizza is my favorite. Very addictive and I keep on coming back for more. <br><br>The pizzas are roman style and is very authentic according to my Italian friends.	1
Food selections for the AYCE hotpot is so limited and they don&#39;t have enough tables for small parties. My friend and I had to share a private room with 2 other girls and the ventilation was horrible. <br><br>Other than that the service was good but I won&#39;t be returning on my own free will and I don&#39;t even want to try the Korean BBQ which I smelled a lot of people burning their food. <br><br>Also the beef was super frozen which I dislike. <br><br>Hot pot in queens is way better with more food selections that come with the AYCE.	0
Had the NY steak. Wasnt good overall.<br><br>Potatoes were soggy. Coleslaw was pathetic. Steak was a-ok. A big portion but tastes so-so.<br><br>Tables and toilets were very dirty.<br><br>Carpark attendants at the open air carpark opposite the venue were extremely rude and stuck up. I would run them over the next time they display such rudeness to customers.<br><br>I went in with my car, and just asked politely how much did parking cost. When i decided to park on the street instead( as it was free) , they were very rude and asked me to get out with horrible body language.	0
Good service and nice space BUT seriously small portions! Be prepared to drop around $150 for 2 people and still feel a little hungry. Entrees were appetizer size. Food was nothing special. Won&#39;t be back.	0
O M G THIS PLACE IS MIND BLOWING.	1
If you want the Cuban experience I recommend you visit. You can buy all types of authentic Cuban food (roasted pork, moros, chicharrones, etc). Each meal is enough food for at least two people if not three, because their portions are immense. <br><br>I stop in from time to time only for some coco frio so I can be healthy and drink pure coconut juice. Each coconut is $2. <br><br>Another great tip is if you have a holiday gathering where someone needs to take the roasted pork you should definitely buy it from Palacio de los Jugos. Also, try their juices (lots of added sugar) but it is what made this place a landmark. My favorite is the watermelon juice. <br><br>They deserve 4 stars only on the basis of authenticity because when you visit this place it can be a big culture shock. Explore and visit!	1
CASH ONLY.I really just didn't like the burger--the relish killed it. No shakes (my fave part of a burger/fry sitch), and I thought it was bloody expensive. Parking is a bitch, and I KNEW that greasy-spoon smell infiltrated every fiber of my clothes during our 20-minute stay.Fries are kick-ass, though!	0
Do they use tons of MSG? The food has that over the top delicious flavor in the first couple of bites.... Thenyou realize how much oil they use the taste satisfaction you initially felt goes away. They also need to learn and teach their staff what good customer service means because they don't have a clue. I tried calling in for take out twice in the same evening they put me on hold twice for at least 10 minutes before I hung up. I called back a 3rd time and again put me on hold. While on hold I decided to walk to the restaurant to see what was really going on. I walk in and the person at the register is ringing up bill ( normal job duties) nothing overwhelming. I ask to speak to a manager and said I am still on hold -it had been 15 minutes- and I am here why are you treating you customers so horribly? I haven't been back since.	0
Wonderful place!  They have a WIDE selection of Vodka, hence their moniker Vodkatorium. Tito's Vodka from Texas is highly recommended.	0
This restaurant exceeded my expectations.	1
The food is delicious and the service is great. It is BYOB which is always a bonus. The fried chicken and waffles were the best I&#39;ve ever had!	1
Went there with a group of friends. Was ok but on vacation I strive for better than ok. Prices were reasonable so this is by no means a bad review just a little under satisfied. Food lacked flavor as well. Would be a great lunch place if they were open for Lunch.	0
Had the grossest dinner I&#39;ve had in a while at this place. It&#39;s been a long time since I&#39;ve had to pick around my food to avoid the gross bits, so I was genuinely shocked to find something so disgusting on my plate at Cafe Cluny. Whatever you do, don&#39;t order the pasta. Seems quite strange that for a French restaurant, everyone was eating burgers and fries - really tells you something about the rest of their menu. One to avoid.	0
Best. Sandwiches. Ever.	1
The Al Pastor and Fish tacos are definitely better than Asada/Carnitas. It&#39;s missing the perfect sauce to cap it off as a great baja taco. It&#39;s nice to have beer to go with it. Overall, the tacos are better than your average, but not as good as a great authentic truck taco.	1
I have been here a handful of times and always have a great time. I love the music and general ambiance of the place and the severs have always been very friendly.<br><br>I generally order from the prix fixe which is a great deal. The goat cheese fondue is amazing, the gnocchi is delicious, the pork cutlet entree is incredible, and the desserts are delicious as well. They have great sangria and other drinks. Honestly, I don&#39;t think I have ever had food here that I didn&#39;t love. <br><br>I have been here for my birthday and for other birthdays and they always bring out this giant plastic cake with huge sparklers on it to blow out which is very fun. <br><br>This is definitely a place for a younger crowd. If i lived in the area i would come here more often, but even if you do not live near by it is worth the drive to check out. <br><br>Like most areas of LA, parking can be difficult and I would recommend making a reservation if you have a group.<br><br>Overall, this place has good food and a great vibe. I would recommend coming here with friends, with family, or even on a date as they have some intimate booths with curtains on them.	1
The Perch is absolutely beautiful. The view is amazing, the way they decorated along with the arrangement of furniture is amazing, and there's a live band! I am usually annoyed with live bands but its not distracting music, its just great conversation/food eating music. It is a bit pricey, but you're paying for the experience.	1
The ambiance could definitely use some TLC. It has a donut shop feeling to it. Other than that, everything was awesome! Dave himself was helping us grill our meat. We loved having the ability to go up to the refrigerators to pick out what we wanted. We didn&#39;t feel pressured and it was a fun experience for everyone involved.	1
Annie's is a hidden gem located near 215 and Valle Verde.  The food and service were excellent!	1
I think the pastries in the front are disappointing. I've been here several times for brunch and once for dinner. The items on the brunch menu were excellent. Tasty food and attentive service. A+	0
2 stars for mediocre food. <br>1 star for service. <br><br>When you spend $50 including tip when we weren&#39;t even seated. Not knowing what to expect, I really wanted my money back. <br><br>Clearly the waitress was all different when bringing out the dishes. And one couldn&#39;t even recall what we ordered and kept asking irrelevant questions. Kept asking and bringing the wrong food and they gave us a table next to the door, and that table was amazingly wobbly and we ate our entire dinner shaking profusely and when we were fed up with the poor service. The waitress finally realized the damn table was wobbly and fixed it when we were done. This is poor service and management I had ever experienced. The atmosphere is really loud so don&#39;t expect to have a decent conversation with your partner unless you want to scream for an hour. <br><br>The damn waitress was unapologetic and she was really clueless about how to serve and make her damn customers leave the damn place satisfied. I will never come back even if you paid me to.	0
I love this place. I came across it by walking on the side walk and letting my curiosity take me down the narrow walkway glittered with small lights. We ordered some grub and some cold libations. It&#39;s a pretty mellow spot, at least it has been the past 4 times I&#39;ve been there. Oh, did a mention they have a good beer selection? They do.	1
The shift lead was such a disappointment. He is the sole reason that I can&#39;t give my recent experience here, a full five stars. And God knows how much I really really really wanted to.<br><br>We celebrated my sister&#39;s 25th here with such high hopes of a flawless evening. I&#39;ve even had this spot bookmarked for a quite a while.<br><br>Let&#39;s start from the beginning.<br>Valet is $5. It&#39;s worth it. My car purs like a kitten, so make sure the valet guy is aware that you are leaving the car on for him....or he&#39;ll make you cringe by turning the ignition on unnecessarily. Upon entrance, you&#39;ll need to catch your breath. It&#39;s a beautiful, romantic, tropical, vintage, eyegasm. It&#39;s art deco, Swiss Family Robinson, and the Belle Epoque, all sexily smashed together in a bowl of Silverlake, Ca. Not a hipster/scenester in sight. It&#39;s truly the definition of a hidden gem.<br><br>To the left is the bar. And a large one at that. The list of libations is also quite large and service is quick. At the bar I noticed something. Yes, it was a crazy busy Saturday night, but these employees don&#39;t seem to smile. Our waitress in the dining room also exhibited the same lack of sparkle I would have loved to have experienced at a restaurant so beautifully designed. It would have been the cherry on top.<br><br>The menu is small. It allowed us to really hone in on what our palates really felt like enjoying for the evening. I had the kale salad; a surprising and memorable large portion of kale, breadcrumbs, pickled grapes, almonds, and parmesean cheese. It was so delicious, I shared my plate with half the table. I also tried the octopus. Despite being fried, it&#39;s delicate taste was not lost. Whatever you choose to eat here will be delicious and well prepared. No points lost on that note.<br><br>My problem: It took over 40 minutes for our entrees to come out. I fully understand that for a large party, the kitchen usually waits for all of the plates to be prepared before serving. BUT...I am also fully aware of the need for your waitress to address your table regarding the wait time. Does it make sense to leave your table in limbo, staring at each other? Of course, we kept ourselves occupied, but still!<br>So my father goes up to the &#39;shift lead&#39; to question what the hold up was, and the guy does this restaurant a complete disservice. He disrespects a patron and his family by answering in such an egregious way, that my father simply stops him mid sentence and demands to speak to the owner of the establishment.<br><br>The owner promptly reveals himself and immediately, my father realizes this is a Frenchman. Long story short, my father and the owner were able to converse in French, the problem was solved, and our entrees were delivered hot and delicious. At the end of our meal, my sister was presented with the most silky chocolate ganache cake by the owner himself. With a lit candle! On the house.<br><br>That! My people, is how you do it!! That! Is how you solve a problem. That! Is how you appease a disgruntled customer. The customer is not interested in your song and dance. I don&#39;t care about A B and/or C. I just wanna know where my waitress/food is. Thank you Sir for quickly rectifying our situation. The way in which you did showed us that you care about your business and you care about how your patrons feel.<br><br>Merci Beaucoup!<br><br>p.s.,<br>Our bus man (not busboy) was absolutely on top of his game. He needs to be promoted. Take note waitress...he was an A++ :)	1
It really says something when, on a workday, I get to down pricey margaritas (that's plural) with lunch and don't have to pick up the check--yet I still end up giving a restaurant something of a pan. And here I am giving Colibri a reluctant two stars--it really deserves about 2.5 stars. My third trip to this Union Square Mexican bistro--a Friday at lunch--was by far the least impressive, and marks for me a downward trajectory for the restaurant that I once recommended to friends when they were in the surrounding area.The very small portions of improperly cooked meat dishes (beef ordered medium must never manifest itself as bloody, red and cool to the touch, and carnitas should never be bone-dry and under-flavored) were not quite offset by the fantastic tableside guacamole with fresh, hot tortillas. If we had only had margaritas and guacamole, this review would be much better--alas, we ordered food.And although the table service was good, our reservation apparently didn't amount to much--we had to actively push for a better table, which they reluctantly gave us. I mean, hey--we're four coworkers looking to chug some premium tequila from their extensive list over a two-hour "working lunch"--don't put us in the freakin' streetfront window. We're not tourists. I'm not sure I will return.	0
We went to The Old Clam House for lunch. Parking was scarce. We discovered a tiny lot behind the restaurant and parked in front of their trash bins. The smell was awful and right behind our car was a dead, decaying rat. Obese flies (and probably blind) smacked into our faces left and right.We expected the restaurant to be busier since we were told to make a reservation. We came in around 3:30pm (on a Thursday) and the restaurant had only 3 tables and a few patrons at the bar. We seated ourselves and a kitchen staff/bus-staff brought out two shot glasses of overly salty seafood broth, cold bread, and piss-yellow, dry, hard butter.We ordered and presented our Groupons: $17 for a whole 2lb crab or regular cut prime rib. We got both and a side of their "Mashed Yukon Potato and Zucchini," Italian Wild Strawberry Cheesecake, and a Coke. The other stuff amounted to about $18. With tips and everything, we spent over $60 and I really wish that $60 was spent elsewhere.Service was ok; not great, not bad. The people were friendly. I would've really appreciated it if our server had told me that the prime rib came with a side of their "potato" already so we wouldn't have ordered another side of their "potato" which we never touched. My boyfriend ordered the crab and as he said, "it's not very good." My boyfriend is not that picky with his crab. Freshly steamed crab is his favorite. No seasoning required. So for him to say the crab was no good, I'm guessing it wasn't very fresh. It did come out really fast, like less than 10 minutes. We've steamed crabs at home and it takes longer than 10 minutes.The prime rib came with 6 pieces of their "Smushed Dutch Creamer Potato." The steak was huge. It was at least 20oz. BUT there was more fat than meat. I lopped off all the fat and the portion of steak compared to fat was pathetic (like less than half). It tasted fine, I guess. The potatoes looked like they got stepped on. I kid you not. I've never had "Dutch" potatoes and I am not making fun of the Dutch. Maybe that's just The Old Clam House's interpretation of that dish. Seriously, what did those poor petite potatoes do to you? They were served with some sour cream on the side. Flavorless and very greasy.The "Mashed Yukon Potato and Zucchini" came out to be exactly like the "Smushed Dutch Creamer Potato." Six pieces for $5.95. A buck for a tiny stepped-on potato!? And I don't know why I got more stepped-on potatoes. I thought I was getting mashed potato. They gave us two menus and one menu had "Mashed..." and the other had "Smushed..." I don't know.The cheesecake could have been better. A sliver of a four-layer cake with alternating yellow cake and cream cheese topped with a strawberry/raspberry compote jelly. The cream cheese was light and airy but still creamy. I liked the cake instead of the usual graham cracker crust but the cake was really wet. Not worth $7.95.	0
Best ice cream in Seattle if not on the west coast. Amazing flavors. Warm friendly place and people. Go there now.	1
I&#39;m NOT a fan of this location! Last Sunday, I invited several friends to celebrate my 32nd birthday at Segafredo&#39;s simply because i had never been there, and we all live in brickell including some of my triathlon teammates. First of all, the waiter seemed like he was still high from the night before, he forgot my drink (the birthday girl!!!) and forgot my friend&#39;s order twice! it was a disaster. It took the waiter close to 30 minutes to simply bring the drinks so we can do the first &#34;toast&#34; of the evening. Then my friends refused for me to get involved in a huge mixup that the waiters and manager had done with our bill (Laura D. wrote an extensive review on that one) they wanted me to be completely oblivious to Segafredo&#39;s lack of professional service and they didn&#39;t want THAT to ruin my birthday.. What a huge SHAME!! I could run this place better than they do! They are in the middle of Brickell and should be providing TOP NOTCH BRICKELL SERVICE and they FAILED.. I would go to Crazy about You instead!!! and i should have done that for my birthday!	0
Great lunch spot. Fast service. The atmosphere is nice for a lunch time crowd, not to busy.	1
There aren&#39;t words to describe my unending love for Canter&#39;s Fairfax and their Pastrami Reuben. Must eat it with a schmear of Russian dressing.	1
I know it's hard to stand out when you are making Italian food. I do not expect too much considering that at times it does tend to all taste the same. I just ask that the flavors are all there to really compliment each other. The only dish that I enjoyed was the roasted beets. My spaghetti dish was average and can't really recall if I really enjoyed it or not. The wine was very average as well. This place is in a very cute spot and like one of my fellow yelpers said, maybe this place will grow on me...	0
The best chops I&#39;ve ever had! Friendly staff, great service, great food, great vibe, and GREAT sauces! A+	1
So I&#39;ve been seeing this place on the home page of Yelp because I work pretty close to this place so I finally went and tried it.<br><br>The layout is very strange... You have to go in and order from this small room (actually the room/unit is pretty big but most of the space is used for the kitchen) and I felt super claustrophobic and rushed to order because the guy is just staring at you while you&#39;re trying to decide what to eat from a very limited selective menu (grilled cheese, hot dogs &amp; fries/tater tots) but I mean I&#39;m very indecisive so please... just give me some time.<br><br>Anyways the guy&#39;s actually pretty nice and but he tries to sell you everything on the menu if you go there with more than one person. And we take his word (I was actually trying to go with recommendations from other yelp reviewers) and try a variety of things. We get the chicken adobo grilled cheese, pork adobo grilled cheese, belly &amp; snout hot dog? &amp; sisig tater tots.<br><br>After ordering, you gotta walk out and walk to another place to sit down.. like I said, very strange layout... I&#39;m waiting for the food, the place is pretty tiny, and you can literally hear everyone&#39;s conversations because the place is pretty small. I guess it could get a little awkward if you&#39;re there with people you&#39;re not very close with.<br><br>Food finally comes out and I&#39;m very disappointed. Not much flavor, and left me with a very garlic-y taste the whole day. I honestly don&#39;t even remember tasting anything but the super buttery &amp; crispy bread for the grilled cheese and straight fried garlic.<br><br>Trying this place once is good enough for me. Really don&#39;t need to come here more than once.	0
I think if you've been to Jamaica/the Caribbean (provided you didn't just eat at resorts), you'll appreciate this place. As we sat waiting for food, my husband remarked that it felt so much like being in Honduras. We walked in and the woman barely greeted us, but was super friendly. We sat ourselves and she disappeared. We grabbed our own beers. Totally okay (apparently, from reviews, to be expected). Food orders were taken, and we waited. Even though we were the only people eating. The food was brought out and was amazing.	0
Boooooring! Chile relleno was flavorless. Cornbread was wet and tasteless. Pork trio was both over- and under-spiced, and the beans were hella-salty. Not worth the money.	0
Randomly stopped in Madison on a cross country trip. I had been to Madison once before to visit a friend in college and I vaguely recall a beer and brat drunken haze. Now beyond our college years, my friend and I decided we wanted to treat ourselves to something nice so we headed for State street and walked around until something peaked our interest. We had been driving for 15 hours and were really hungry and in need of some good beverages. We came across Paul's and couldn't have asked for a better experience. It is a bit on the upscale side and we were pretty ragged looking, but that didn't seem to be a problem. Our waiter James was awesome and he was really funny and helpful with the menu. We had no idea what to expect and ended up ordering a few different plates as well as a couple cocktails. Everything was really good and the prices weren't bad either for the high quality of food you're getting. Would recommend this place to anyone heading towards Madison.	1
I brought takeout from this restaurant for a client lunch this week. Overall the food was average at best. I sampled the Pad Thai Cashew Chicken Swimming Rama Jungle Curry and the Phad Pug. By far my favorite was the Jungle Curry. My least favorite was the Swimming Rama and pales in comparison to that served up by Pen Thai in Bothell. Also I recommend take out as the staff was somewhat unfriendly and not very accommodating.	0
We live locally and had dined at Canaletto before when we had family visiting Las Vegas. So when we had company visiting again we decided to make reservations at Canaletto again. It's in such a fun location ... inside the square at the Venetian. The opera singers in the square, the decor, the lighting make it such a special destination.While we thoroughly enjoyed our first visit to Canaletto this one was disappointing. For starters, the server who first provided us with menus had a food stain very visible on the label of his jacket. Definitely a turnoff. As far as the food, the reviews were mixed among our party of four. Whoever ordered pasta dishes loved the sauces. The caesar salads which two of us ordered as a first course were ice cold ... as though the lettuce was just taken out of the freezer. Barely edible. Also the grilled salmon entree was very average, almost tasteless. Perhaps because they serve so many tourists who never return again the restaurant management just isn't that attentive.	0
Go here. If you&#39;re within 20 miles of this place, go.<br><br>Reason one: Apple Pan has survived intact and unchanged in West LA for 60 years. It&#39;s like a friggin&#39; time machine. That alone is worth the price of admission. Things in WLA don&#39;t survive this long due to the mindless loyalty of the local blue collar residents (because there are none). <br><br>Reason two: The menu and the food are also from a time warp- in a good way. Nobody messed with the formula or recipes over the years and now it seems like a gimmick. Gimmicks are fine sometimes, but Apple Pan is not one of them. <br><br>And please, don&#39;t put this (or any historic restaurant) in the race for &#34;best&#34; whatever in town. Honestly, are you comparing nouveau fare like Father&#39;s Office burgers (which I like) to the stuff your grampa used to eat back in the day? (when he had teeth)	1
Not only is the food amazing the service is outstanding and on Monday Nights starting at 6PM they host FREE poker tournaments by the Nevada Poker League. Great food and service and poker tournaments how can you beat this deal?	1
Was very annoyed of having to drive all the way downtown from Sherman Oaks for business lunch at Perch, but it ended up being the highlight of my day! The location, the view, the vibe, the service, the FOOD...next time you need a break and an experience, do yourself a favor, make the pilgrimage - you won't be disappointed. Treat yourself to something special. P.S. See if you can get Colin to be your server, the man is a real pro, and just a joy to deal with.	1
Was advised to come here. A little disappointed. Steak wasn&#39;t great. I always get a rib-eye cooked med/rare. It came out a little overcooked. For the price and atmosphere I expected much better.	0
Cuban sandwich isn&#39;t nice at all. They appear to have used sweet pickles and it is far too sweet. The other plates taste alright but far too small	0
The primary reason I come here is for Robert as pizza! It&#39;s absolutely delicious and the perfect size.<br>They come twice a year at this Location and at Madison sq eats aswell! <br>I&#39;ve tried a couple different vendors which were a miss - canolis and vegetarian meat balls - both were bad	1
Fresh sushi, great service, and great prices. Now how can you beat that. You get the best service and the food comes out faster at the bar. The sushi chef&#39;s are more hands on with you at the bar and they are very accommodating. Bottom line eat at the bar! :)<br><br>A must try and a keep coming back for more kind of place!	1
Salty...Korean twist on dishes. Good food esp. the tuna on rice. Potato pancake was great. Good use of sunchoke throughout.	1
Great food friendly staff! Thank god we got there early because business picked up and there wasn&#39;t enough seating for everyone but the owner was more than accommodating and concerned about everyone! The food is amazing and well worth it! I haven&#39;t taken my family of four out for under $40 and left stuffed! that&#39;s Including TNT Donut! We even bought our own beer next door and our waiter kept it cold while we ate! I can&#39;t wait to go back the next time we break our diet!	1
Omar is the man and the food is terrific! If you don&#39;t know Omar or any of the tacos you should go soon! <br><br>The Japanese short rib taco is unreal and so is the el pastor and even the samurai. The truffle fries are great and if you go Phil&#39;s way you won&#39;t be disappointed.<br><br>I will definitely be going back for years to come. <br><br>Thank you for the great meals and awesome hospitality. <br><br>Cheers	1
Great drinks. HORRIBLE service. I get it, it's LA on a busy Sunday and I look 18. But I couldn't even get the table cleaned from the previous patrons. It took over a reasonable time to place an order, get our drinks and we tried several times to flag someone down to even get our check. I'm stunned on how poor the service is here. But I guess when you are attached to LACMA you really don't have to worry about customer service.	0
I&#39;ve eaten at MG three times. The first time it was OK., the second not great and the third terrible. Three strikes you&#39;re out. Waste of money and calories. Steak totally fatty, chicken barely cooked. Service was good and hostess very sweet.	0
OpenTable said the place had no availability within 2.5 hours of my requested reservation time so I opted to call in and scored a table on a thirsty Thursday night and specifically requested for outdoor dining.<br><br>Although the entire party didn&#39;t show up on time, our reservation was honored as soon as most of us arrived. We just had to wait at the bar before getting seated.<br><br>Myself and two others in our party ordered the Little Bunny Frou Frou which was rabbit ravioli. I&#39;ve never had rabbit meat but since it was recommended by our waiter and fellow Yelpers, I gave it a go. It was DELIGHTFULLY TASTY! I also highly recommend the delicious truffle fries. <br><br>My friends (Bostonians and Angelenos) and guests thoroughly enjoyed the ambience and views of DTLA although I don&#39;t think they&#39;re the most spectacular. The pro&#39;s: It wasn&#39;t crowded and there were no lines up the stairwell to the rooftop. Although it got chilly dining outdoors, we were surrounded by headlamps and had wine and cocktails that kept us toasty.<br><br>3 stars for dining service<br>5 stars for the food<br>3.5 stars for the ambience (on a Thursday evening) and view	1
This was our best meal for the week in the Venetian.	1
Soda watered down!Service is okay..But the chicken was bomb :)The garlic fried chicken was perfectly crispy and the spicy one I got was so spicy but I switched off from garlic chicken and spicy chicken and they somehow married together very well.I love the cubed pickled radish.. It compliments the chicken. YummmCan't wait to go to LA again and stop by some Kyochon Chicken.	1
I've heard such good things about this place but we had a meal there a couple weeks ago and were not impressed. I had the garlic chicken and it was terrible. The garlic was so overpowering and the rest of the dish had no taste. My sister had the pumpkin curry and that wasn't much better. You could taste the heat of the spice but there really wasn't a good balance of flavors. Disappointed considering what we have heard.	0
This is brilliant. I love this bar and the people here. Everyone is chill and fun and well, awesome. Great food, cocktails that focus on deliciousness over flash and a menu that&#39;s tasty and varied. So happy to have this bar, managed by the cool and hilarious Blerim in Hollywood.	1
We had a window seat overlooking the strip. Absolutely gorgeous!!! Service was the best, and the food was even better!!! Probably the best meal I've ever had!! Lobster was perfect, and so was the filet. I will go back for sure!!	1
I love this place! I'm honestly so sick of Birds, and this place is such a refreshing and delightful addition to that area. They fit right in with the scene, and apparently the owners are connected to Oaks Gourmet as well, which makes perfect sense. The blue cheese tater tots and clam chowder were ridiculously good. The tastings are really fun and they have a good selection of beer on tap. I can't wait to try more of the foods on the menu, they look innovative and delicious!I can't wait to go back!	1
Pros: Misty spray from outdoor fans. <br><br>Cons: Steaks &amp; pasta isn&#39;t anything to rave about. Isn&#39;t a clear delineation between busboys &amp; waiters.	0
It was my first time eating here and I decided to have a cheese tamale and horchata. The tamale was very warm and delicious. Overall the meal was very delicious and exceeded my expectations. The service and atmosphere were also very good.	1
Went in feeling excited, left feeling disappointed.<br><br>The service wasn&#39;t great, I&#39;d say it was barely decent. I had mentioned to my server it was my first time here and she did not even take the time to explain or recommend anything on the menu. Being a server myself, I found that pretty rude. Also, there was this one server or busser that kept coming by to take our bowls/plates &amp; silverware when we were clearly not finished with it. He even took me &amp; my friends napkins which we were obviously using throughout our meal. I honestly did not understand why he took all our silverware when there was still food on our table LOL I had high hopes for this place, I really did.. but the service just killed it for me.	0
been going here since high school (that's forever)!The food here is AWESOME!Always a very casual place to go any time.The place did change though-the service isn't as fun and personal as it used to be and the people who come here are totally emo and wannabes.Not the same place when locals used to come but nevertheless the food is still great. I only come by twice a year now.	1
Came for brunch when I was visiting Chicago. The food was very good. The portion was big with reasonable price. I liked the relaxing atmosphere a lot. The staff were very nice as well!	1
Unfortunately the food was very disappointing. We had the short rib, sirloin cap, kennebec fries and shaved brussels sprouts. The food was just OK (very salty) and definitely overpriced. The only thing we did thoroughly enjoy was the smoke stack cocktail. Glad I tried this place but I won&#39;t be back.	0
Good table attentive staff delicious baked goods bacon eggs benedict and omelette. Success.	1
I've been looking for a good xiaolongbao place and was recommend to this restaurant. When you walk into the restaurant, you definitely smell the xiaolongbao which is a good sign but...when I took a bite of it, I just thought it was so-so. I've definitely had better. The service needs some work too.	0
Working in the suburbs and taking transit to work, my options for lunch are limited to a handful of places within walking distance, so it gets repetitive... and I rarely even go out for lunch. So it was with joy a few years ago that I was downtown for a meeting and happened upon something called Brown Bag Lunch Truck while checking out the food truck scene. I cried a little when I&#39;d finished because there was no more to be had- I was that impressed with the flavor combinations. I followed the truck on social media hoping in vain for another chance encounter. It never happened but through the Facebook feed found out about BBLT&#39;s new wheel-less brother, smalls. AMEN!<br>I&#39;ve since carried out three times and am a huge fan. I could eat a dump truck full of their garlic rice and brisket. The elotes made me want to sing. Super cool staff, everything I&#39;ve eaten has been outstanding, and it&#39;s on my way home. This is going to work out rather well.	1
1 star because I came here and wanted to meet a couple friends. I had been here many times prior with no issues about seating but their seating system is TERRIBLE and forced me and my friends to leave and go to RAMEN SORA. <br><br>Let me explain: They will NOT seat you unless your full party is present. Okay I get that-- that&#39;s fine. But my friend called and said she was going to be 30 min late and to go ahead and start eating and she would join us. <br><br>WELL.. That is NOT allowed at Monta. They follow strict rules and would rather have you LEAVE than seat you at a table (that seats four people) and have your remaining party join you. <br><br>SO in essence, if you&#39;re seated at a table with 2 extra seats you CANNOT have anyone come in and sit down and join you. <br><br>I was told that my friend would have to re-check in and wait. (?? that doesn&#39;t even make sense) <br><br>SORRY MONTA, but the hassle is definitely not worth it. I&#39;d rather get my fill ELSEWHERE. I left immediately after they didn&#39;t negotiate seating. <br><br>-angry yelper.	0
Yes! My boyfriend and I went to Emily last night and it was fantastic. We got the Colony and the Lady Pizza Girl at the recommendation of other Yelpers, and they were both tasty and interesting. I had never had honey on pizza before, and it&#39;s definitely something I&#39;ll be trying at home in the near future! The two pizzas were enough for our meal and we still had some left over for lunch today.<br><br>The service was wonderful, and a woman named Emily (maybe the owner?) checked in on us a couple of times to see that we were doing alright. The decor was nice, and the selection of music was also fantastic. <br><br>The place is a little pricey, but it was worth it for the awesome pizza and the cozy atmosphere.	1
This place has to be one of my favorite sushi place in LA. Reasonable pricing for quality food. My husband and I always get the toro($10), amaebi($10), uni($10), and scallop($8) nigiri and it is always delicious and super fresh. The service is also always very quick, efficient and friendly.<br><br>Before we started coming here we always went to Komasa, and the biggest difference for me is the quality of the preparation and the personal connection with the sushi chief. Unlike Komasa which only has one sushi chief every time we go Oomasa has 3 and they each have their own section; therefore, your food is prepared properly and your sushi does not fall apart when you pick them up (this has happened many times with Komasa.<br><br>Some of the must haves: clam miso soup, raw oyster with ponzu sauce, the 4 types of sushi mentioned above and unagi nigiri (eel, and they BBQ the eel as you order them. it is melt in your month goodness)	1
Too bad if you&#39;re not Korean..you won&#39;t get neither good service or service. <br>Food is average by the way.	0
I checked out Urban Ramen a couple of weeks ago after a night of comedy over at Meltdown Comics which is in walking distance of. I haven't ever had "fancy ramen" before aka the non Cup O'Noodle variety but my dining partner had and we checked this place out.The wait staff is extremely friendly and knowledgeable. Our server made a point of explaining what ramen is in their context and recommended one for me to try based on what I liked. He recommended the spicy tonkotsu ramen with an egg and it was awesome - I added chili paste because I like a lot of spice, so it was a little mellower than I was expecting but still good. I got the thick noodles, but tried my partner's thin noodles and would get those next time. It was good, inexpensive relatively with good service and we could chat in the space so it wasnt too noisy. Would definitely visit again!	1
nice location but worst service ever. We had to ask for our waiter several times after waiting over an hour and then he blamed it on having to take a break.	0
The &#34;end-less gnocchi&#34; on the 29th is a joke at this place. We thought it would be the standard order a plate at a time until you&#39;re done set-up. Silly us. The way it actually works here is you wait for a guy to bring out a single plate of gnocchi from the kitchen and walk around to everyone in the restaurant giving them each a pre-allocated single spoon-full of gnocchi. You don&#39;t even get to choose which kind of sauce you&#39;d like. Instead, they have a series of 6 pre-made sauces that rotate and if you don&#39;t like it, you just have to wait another 15 minutes for your next spoon of gnocchi. After 45 minutes and barely having eaten anything, we requested the remaining few pieces of gnocchi at the end of one round. The server mumbled something about having to &#39;check and see&#39; and walked away. We looked over at the kitchen in disbelief and saw the server eating the rest of the gnocchi himself, straight from the serving plate!<br><br>$15/person and 1.5 Hr waiting time...NOT worth it!!	0
Loved every aspect of this meal. Food &amp; service were top notch. The secondary dining room felt a bit under-designed, not completed. I'd request to sit in the main room.The meat? Untouchable. Perfection.	1
This is for dinner. A couple friends and I shared about 8 or so plates. Everything was amazing - the addictive cabbage and the tofu were standouts to me. If you get dessert, get the azuki bean - MIND BLOWN.<br><br>A restaurant can have amazing food but what makes me want to come back to a place is the service that comes with that amazing food. The owner, who was our server that night, took the time to explain each dish. He explained how in Japan, guests judge your restaurant on how good you can prepare cabbage. He told us about how the tofu was prepared 2 days before serving that night. And he told us about Izakaya&#39;s story. Never had I felt more connected to what I was eating and never had I felt more connected to a restaurant&#39;s story - it&#39;s a great one. And I think it made the food that much better.<br><br>I&#39;m definitely coming back again and again and again.	1
Delicious fare, made fresh when you order. Good prices, and very friendly owners.	1
A unique experience indeed but the dishes often taste so strange it is difficult to enjoy them as a good meal rather simply as an interesting experience.	0
I'm down with LA Cafe. Yes, it's expensive and sometimes a little slow, BUT it also delivers and it's the only thing open that serves real food in that neighborhood late at night without dropping a hundred bucks at nearby restaurants. The farmers salad is good. The croissants are my favorite croissant. The hippy rice crispie is expensive but I really love it.Look, the only down side is it's expensive. But it's so damned convenient and the food really is good.	1
Ordered a lot of food, all bland. Even worse, terrible service. Wasn't even a busy night, but I had to ask my waitress for water three times. Plus we ordered her recommendations, yet she never asked how our food was. Bianca verde and mushroom pizzas especially bland. Polenta dish, not good. Don't believe the hype. WASTE OF MONEY, go somewhere else.	0
Surely this place is a gem. With a very warming atmosphere and a polite staff, it definitely sets up a very welcoming and good vibe. <br><br>The menu is succinct, so if you&#39;re looking for a giant ensemble to order from, En Hakkore is not the best choice for such. I ordered the sashimi-bap and my friend have the mega kimbap roll. Both undoubtedly were delicious. I truly enjoyed the overall dining experience here and loved the fact the their selection of teas were more than a simple green or black. <br><br>Price wise, it was reasonable for what was offered, and I do recommend bringing a date here or someone you wanna impress. Because it really is just a great place for that vibe. <br><br>Not ideal for the child&#39;s palate. <br><br>I would definitely return here nonetheless.	1
&#34;Game On&#34;<br><br>I played tic tac toe with the waitress, i won. <br><br>then she wanted to play hangman.<br><br>i won that too!<br><br>My friend Tarik who&#39;s a foodie, suggested we try this place that only serves Steak Frites! <br><br>I won again, because, I love Steak Frites.<br><br>you&#39;d never know this place was there, at least i never noticed, and i drive down Melrose all the time. <br><br>But i&#39;m glad i know it&#39;s there now, and i will most definitely go again.<br><br>why? because i love Tic Tac Toe, Hangman, and Steak Frites.	1
15 bucks for a 12oz. draft of Estralla ? Its the Budwiser of Spain. Are you F&#39;in kidding me.	0
I love Apple Pan when I'm craving a good ol' fashioned cheeseburger and fries. Or a slice of pie a la mode. Simple, fast service and satisfying food every time. I'm a hickory burger girl- love the hickory sauce. They're fries are nothing special, but you almost need them with the burger, unless of course you order pie! I sort of wish they had shakes, but I guess that would be too much of a good thing. Go at an odd hour so you don't have to awkwardly stand behind people as they eat and so you can score parking in back, otherwise that neighborhood is a bitch to park in. Great for after a movie at the Landmark 'cause they're open till 12am weeknights and 1am weekends!	1
If you want to be spoiled, go here.  It doesn't matter if you're an executive in a suit, a secretary or tourists around town, they treat you impeccably.  It's an old school steakhouse atmosphere, with dark wood, portraits and long white tablecloths, but the staff is approachable, engaging and humorous.  I love it from the second they offer to check my coat to the multiple wishes of have a good day as we exit. The food lives up to the service.  The soups are hot, silky and delicious, the salads bright and freshly dressed, the steaks seared to a crust on the outside and a perfect temp on the inside.  It's a shame I'm so full I don't ever make it to dessert.  I'm sure that would be glorious too. I look forward to every visit here and have never walked away disappointed.  Good job, Jimmy.	0
Just came back from the restaurant that we had to wait almost 2 months.It was very interesting experience. But I&#39;m still hungry..... As most you know that you don&#39;t know what you get until they serve you. Even on the menu it doesn&#39;t explain much. Most of the meal was one bite dish. Food was definitely good but did it worth $135? I would say &#34;NO&#34; it because I still am hungry after the meal. The quality was great. Most of the meal was seafood. You can tell that they are using very fresh fish. <br><br>We brought both red and white wine. We finished both. It&#39;s great that they are BYOB. The biggest complaint I have is the desert. They served us sorbet and ice cream. How can they serve 2 cold desert? Is it sort of common sense in the cooking world that if you serve cold desert, you serve warm (baked) desert for the next? I was very satisfied until the desert came. No coffee, nothing.<br><br>Like I said before, it was a good experience. I&#39;d not probably going back there anytime soon.	1
Wasn&#39;t too impressed. Especially given people&#39;s rave review and comments. The food is good and the service is fine but isn&#39;t amazing or anything. It is a like more authentic Johnny Rockets without being too kitschy or commercial. Everyone should go to this landmark at least once if only to say that they have been there.	1
One star is only for the decor of a Chinese noodle restaurant. Don&#39;t be fooled by the high ratings of this restaurant like my family did. <br><br>** ONLY EAT HERE IF THIS IS THE LAAAAST PLACE YOU CAN FIND CHINESE FOOOD**<br><br>Let me advise you why not to come here:<br>- first walked in, stood there and waited at the entrance for a good 6-7 minutes for someone to acknowledge my existence although 4 staff members made contact with me as well as it not being busy.<br><br>-when my family and I were seated, table next to us had seemingly waited patiently for someone to take their orders. The women and her grandma asked they can please order. The staff members never came around and so they walked out on their table. We were totally shocked.<br><br>-Service was worse than most Chinese restaurants which makes me very tolerable to bad service. But, their servers fit in the category of extreme. They give you attitude, they ignore your requests of their service even when you scream out &#34;hi, excuse me!&#34; while raising your arm. Worst of all was when everyone finished their food with the first two entrees ordered had been forgotten, the lady denied of with such a strong passion that they didn&#39;t forget about the two entrees. Six of us were all finished before the two had even got their food. No apologies, no nothing. <br><br>-then, they asked for the check and they slapped it on the table while saying, &#34;gratuity is included&#34;. No thank you, no smile, not even a slight glance before walking away. We reread the menu to double check if they ever mentioned a gratuity policy with a certain number of people. Nope! None.<br><br>-MOST IMPORTANTLY...THEIR FOOD. The Sui kaow wonton egg noodle soup was mediocre. It had only 1 choy with 5 pieces and was very small. Looked like something you can make at home. Not worth it. Seafood pan friend noodles had too much gravy which made the noodles very soggy. The egg drop beef over rice was horrible. It literally looked like a plate of rice, 7-10 small chunks of beef with scrambled egg then clear gravy poured right on top with it the whole dish being very bland. Our XO chow fun was super bland but overly covered in chilli flakes. Worst of all was finding a dried clump of vermicelli that had chili on it randomly on one of our entrees that had no no vermicelli. It means they&#39;re dirty because it was right on top when they placed the entree down.<br><br>This is not the place to go if you want a good meal and experience with very valuable family time. They wasted our time.	0
This place broke the cardinal rule and did not provide chips and house salsa at the table. The Pastor was passable but the asada was eh... Oh and prices were not in line with the portions or quality.	0
Sul Lung Tang is my second favorite Korean meal after New Year's after SaeBae. There are a variety of great Sul Lung Tang restaurants in KTown, but personally this place is in contention for the best. Although the broth may be a little on the clear side, it's had all the fat strained so that it isn't as heavy a meal. I can down a whole bowl and not feel guilty and fat for pigging out. They also have great kimchi and kakdugi. The whole kimchi juice is in the teapot is also genius. There's only one other place that competes in my book... Which one do you like better?	1
My friend recommended Junior&#39;s cheesecake since it&#39;s featured on food network. I am not a big fan of cheesecake, but I decided to sacrifice myself for the &#34;greater&#34; taste. I am not gonna whine about paying $6.50 for a slice of strawberry cheesecake since I spent $9.50 at Roxy Delicatessen the next day, but I just can&#39;t appreciate the cheesecake here. It tasted more like cream cake than cheesecake. And one thing really bothered me was that the strawberries weren&#39;t hulled.	0
Worst experience and pretty sure I have food poisoning.My boyfriend and I went tonight around 6pm. After we had mentioned to the hostess if she could check on our 2 burgers because we had been waiting almost 40 minutes, she came back and said the food will be out soon.I'm pretty sure the cooks just put whatever was done on a plate and brought it out My boyfriend kept saying his burger was weird and that it was melting in his mouth and was super light and soft. I thought that was a good thing but when I saw it and tasted it myself (you couldn't tell because it had so much sauce at first) I noticed it was completely raw. Beyond rare and mushy We both will never go back. Absolutely disgusting and now feel sick	0
If this is the pinnacle of the Cuban Sandwich, then maybe it is not for me. None of the ingredients popped for me. Meh, I&#39;ve experienced better was exactly what I thought;	0
We had a great experience at Rock Bottom. Food was quick and good. The calamari could have used a little more salt but everything else. We were seated quickly and had great service. Easy to get reservations!!	1
Good coffee, supposedly-fancy food that never pans out. The service is 25% great and 75% too-cool-for-school. (You know that hipster thing where they either lavishly describe each ingredient or just act like you&#39;re bothering them....)<br><br>I&#39;m never going back.<br><br>Yes, the coffee is terrific, if absurdly expensive. But sometimes they take forever to make your cup. Everyone else gets theirs, and the barista is still mystically waving boiling water through the air for yours.<br><br>The food is great in theory, but in practice, not so much.<br><br>Ordinary meals are given odd names and odder treatments. A &#34;breakfast sandwich&#34; is served on a &#34;biscuit&#34; which is hard and dry. The bacon on said sammich is so thick it can&#39;t be eaten.<br><br>The omelettes are just dry, overcooked egg, with stuff rolled up in them. The filling flavors never meld. They never soften the egg with cream or water: it&#39;s like rubber. Great quality ingredients treated badly. What&#39;s the point of putting hard sundried tomatoes with soft carmelized onions and bits of cheese that never merge with the other ingredients? I end up taking it apart and treating it as egg-paper and some condiments.<br><br>Don&#39;t get me started on the toast, which is never dark, always soft (no matter how &#39;whole-grained&#39; it is), and overly greased--when you don&#39;t even ask for it to be.<br><br>The last straw for me was a &#39;German pancake&#39; which took 30 minutes to cook: no warning, I just sat there for 25 minutes until I inquired, everyone else in the joint who ordered after me already having been served, only to be told &#34;oh that takes half an hour.&#34; &#34;Could you not have mentioned that?&#34; I inquired pointlessly.<br><br>Then said pancake was unsalted, flour-y and wet. Unsuitable for eating. Again, good ingredients poorly cooked. Poor communication.<br><br>The pastries are awesome, even if some of them are hard and dry. <br><br>But if you want to spend $10-12 on a dry pastry and a great cup of (slowly-made coffee), this is the place for you.<br><br>But it&#39;s not for me.	0
The pork shoulder sandwiches here are the main attraction, and they are AMAZING served with the garlic aioli sauce, corn on the cob, and a soda.	1
Service is incredibly rude. She told me to &#34;be patient&#34; when I asked for water after sitting for 10+ min. Sandwiches are delicious. But won&#39;t be going back due to terrible service.	0
You can really work up a thirst in and around Red Hook...<br><br>That&#39;s because it&#39;s so goddamn far from everything, and when the bus doesn&#39;t show up you probably end up saying &#34;Screw it!&#34; and just walking it down Van Brunt.<br><br>Then, just as the shimmering heat mirages start to gang up on you, you spot the Brooklyn Ice House.<br><br>Happily, you see that they have two pulled pork sandwiches for $5.00 (not the greatest BBQ I&#39;ve ever had, but consider them decent bar food and you&#39;ll be happy). <br><br>The draft selections are good, diverse, and change regularly...Although prices are what you&#39;d pay lots of places: ~$6/pint.<br><br>But there&#39;s a diverse selection of bottled beers (Sixpoint and lots of others) really cheap, like $3/bottle.<br><br>Has an appealing DIY patio/backyard space. Lots of beat-up old metal chairs in Crayon primary colors, gravel floor, big umbrellas, and ramshackle tables -- homemade in the best sense.	1
let Fremont and Belltown keep all of the places like this ... unfortunately Ballard seems to be seeing more not less of this type of place what with Linda opening a !?!swanky burger joint!?! down on Ballard Ave. There are better happy hours better fish tacos and better tortilla soup within spitting distance of this crowdstuffed loud singles place. Give me a beer at Hatie's Hat and let's call it a night!	0
LBW makes it so I don&#39;t have to leave the neighborhood for a good cocktail. El Chupacabra and the Green Eyes were delicious. Burger was really great as well. Everyone has heard of this place by now and it was packed at 7pm on a Friday. Baos were meh. We tried the steak and pork belly and I wouldn&#39;t order either of those again. Would definitely order the burger though. Overall, good service, great drinks and a nice addition to the neighborhood.	1
oh. my. god. get over chipotle already. it sucks, it&#39;s expensive and i had to sit across from some dumb kid with gigantic plugs, a straight edge tattoo that took up the length of her entire SHIN, and BRACES. YOU ARE 12 WHAT ARE YOU THINKING. it sounds irrelevant but that&#39;s the type of self-important, desperate alt-kid wannabes that suck chipotle&#39;s wang so hard. when you&#39;re old enough to get a job, save up for laser tattoo removal because i&#39;m sure you will cave in and get hammered when you realize what a dumb ass thing you have done to your body. in the meantime, i will be getting my mexican food from moe&#39;s, roberto&#39;s and qdoba. actually, pretty much anywhere but dumb ass chipotle.	0
D.I.R.T.Y....went here for breakfast because it is near our hotel and had 4.5 stars. When we walked in no one greeted us and no one was at the counter. We took a quick look at the menu, which was very old, and ordered two cafe au lait. Every single table inside was dirty, my chair had a whole in it, and after looking around we took our coffees to go. I couldn&#39;t find a sanitation grade anywhere, but I&#39;m sure it was low. I don&#39;t know how this place has such good reviews.	0
When we dined at Cleo, they had been open a mere five days. I expected a shaky kitchen, spotty service and a healthy dose of chaos. What I experienced was some of the most flavorful Middle-Eastern/Mediterranean cuisine I&#39;d ever tasted-- brought to our table by a server who&#39;s knowledge of the menu was as encyclopedic as she was adorable-- all in a vibrant, exciting atmosphere. Some favorites were the wagyu and pork belly kababs, grilled octopus, mushrooms, brussels sprouts and the duck bastilla-- but nearly everything we had (12 small plates in all) was incredibly flavorful and well-prepared. And don&#39;t let me forget the cocktails. We ordered six or seven different drinks throughout our meal-- all superb-- and each one had some little unexpected twist to the flavor profile that paired perfectly with the exotic spices in the food. We&#39;ll be back!	1
This place is so LA I half expected the characters from 90210 to be sitting by the pool. The two stars are for the view, the taste of the drinks, and their willingness to relocate us from an inside table in a corner to one by the pool. For anyone that&#39;s wondering I paid $17 for a small serving of mediocre pasta and we were there during sunset hour so I wanna say I paid about $7 each for some margaritas. The patrons ranged from casually dressed to guys puffin on cigars in pinstriped suits lounging on the couches. We had no reservations but were seated right away anyway(the hostess wasn&#39;t too happy about us not having reservations despite the place being almost empty at 6pm). The waitresses all look like models, and that&#39;s standard in most nice places in LA. These waitresses probably are the kind that say &#34;I&#39;m an actress and work part time as a waitress&#34; instead of the other way around. So LA. They also act as if they&#39;ve made it big somehow. If you like pretentiousness on the part of the wait staff come here. Also they take forever to bring the food/drinks and are extremely rude. We encountered 2 waitresses who acted this way. Maybe I looked poor so they didn&#39;t want to waste their time. *shrugs* I am definitely not complaining about the price of this place because it is a nice experience with a great view in the best city in the world (I may be a little biased) but the service is terrible and it makes me not want to go back.	0
Eh food. Coffee shop grilled cheese cold and store bought fake cheese.Poor boy rich girl was unappetizing. Our waiter Ian B. with the "statche" was pretty mediocre and kinda ignored us. Looked like he needed to learn to smile. Also I later received a very harassing yelp message about this post...No mirror in the bathroom?!	0
This is a must have restaurant for your Madison bucket list. Easily one of my favorite places, and not just because my friend used to work here.	1
We had great service our waitress was awesome! Granted we went during lunch on a Tuesday but our service was awesome. Beer was great exactly as described and the food was wonderful and sourced locally. One of the best restaurants we have been in the touristy areas of Seattle.	1
The perch rooftop outside dining is one of the best environments in downtown LA. <br><br>The service is utterly professional, warm and friendly. Our server, Elizabeth, was super helpful to recommend dishes and drink pairings.<br><br>To start, I&#39;d recommend the pork belly and tuna. Perfect portions. We had the &#34;little bunny fru&#34; entree, the risotto, along with amazing side of brussels. <br><br> We came on a Friday night and the live band was a great complement to the night.<br><br>I&#39;ll be back.	1
Great food, music, and atmosphere. A hidden gem in vegas away from the strip. I will definitely return	1
Cauliflower Truffle Soup. No trip to Toulouse is complete without this divine soup! The brasserie has friendly, quick service and outstanding food. The steak with the crawfish tasso sauce was incredible, accompanied with a great wine selection. Both my entree and wine choice were recommendations from the waiter, who listened to my preferences and made suggestions accordingly. No visit to Seattle is complete without stopping here for dinner.	0
Ordered a slice and paid for it. One of the owners placed it in the oven. A minute later he looked at me like he had never seen me before. Then he took a phone call. I waited 5 mins and tried to get his attention as my slice burned. Another guy finally asked if I needed help. He took out the burned slice and tried to pass it off as &#34;crispy.&#34; I asked for a new one that had just come out of the oven. The owner was still on the phone and didn&#39;t bother to ask what was going on. The dough was nearly raw in the middle. I couldn&#39;t finish it. Just got up and left. When I left the owner was still on the phone. Are these guys kidding? Shame because if they just cooked it properly it would be very good. Another issue is it doesn&#39;t seem like anyone speaks English.	0
Had a late lunch here last week. Very charming decor, with plenty of small tables, abundant plant decorations, and comfy seating.<br><br>I had the lunch set, which includes 2 rice balls, your choice of miso soup, pickled vegetables, and a small side. I had the hawaiian and eel rice balls, preferring the hawaiian (Spam never tasted so good!). The miso soup with mushrooms was delicate and far more nuanced than the normal miso at the ubiquitous sushi restaurants. The pickles could have been a little more strongly flavored/salted, but had a nice crunch to them.<br><br>All in all, for $10, hard to beat a place like this for lunch!	1
Go here! Order the wine blessed by the local Rabbi, it&#39;s good for your soul and also a Mitzvah... Cheers	1
Decently good, but nothing sensational. These are the sentiments I had after a group of 9 friends and myself went. For being in a large group, the services was timely. However, I wasn't necessarily crazy about the sourdough bread and tomato cream cheese spread: I was just starved! They were sort of awkward flavors to pair together.	0
Went for Brunch. Ordered the spicy chicken and sweet potato hash with poached eggs and green chile hollandaise and the scrambled egg enchiladas with chorizo, red chile sauce and goat cheese.<br><br>The enchiladas were so tiny they looked like taquitos. There were two extremely small tortillas filled with barely any eggs on a plate with some sauce. For $16, I expected A LOT more. <br><br>The poached egg/hash concoction was inedible. The spice totally overpowered the dish. I could not taste any flavors of sweet potatoes, chicken or egg. <br><br>This ended up being a super disappointing experience.	0
Our Anniversary Dinner. Wonderful experience even if the weatherman was wrong. Service attentive &amp; friendly. Appetizer was a cheese plate w/some well-selected cheeses &amp; garnishes &amp; a beautiful presentation. Hubby had crab cakes which he said were excellent. I had a chicken medallions dish w/risotto &amp; spinach. Spinach was very tasty, risotto was good with a nice-sized serving &amp; chicken medallions had a very flavorful, slightly teasing sauce making you want more. Hubby had a unique creme brulee for dessert/chocolate w/hazelnuts &amp; macadamia nuts. He does not normally choose creme brulee, but he loved this creme brulee. I had a very generous, well-presented raspberry sorbet. Ian, the Mgr visited us &amp; was very hospitable. A very enjoyable day.	0
Honestly one star for the music and my wife's Arnold Palmer . Started with the quinoa salad. Bland does not describe it accurately. It was romaine with a scoop of quinoa and some cranberries and carrots. The portion was huge but bland. We tried to rescue it with salt and pepper. No dice. Next we had the short rib grilled cheese and a turkey burger. Every burger person knows the secret to a good burger is the bun. These tasted like Ralph's 50 percent off aisle buns. Everything else on turkey burger was bland. Wife's short rib sandwich looked gross and tasted so bland tapito could not salvage it. Service was good but the chefs need to learn to properly season their food. Won't be back.	0
This place is amazing. It&#39;s in a nice quiet area between Ave A and 1st Ave on 10th street and this little gem is perfect for anyone. We use it to study because it has perfect drinks, snacks and wi-fi (just ask for the password). It is very affordable and the best drink is easily the chai. No matter who it is working the cafe, they always &#34;accidentally&#34; make a little bit too much and so they fill up your mug or to-go cup and give you a little something something to sip on the side while you wait for your food or if you just wanna quick hit of the delicious drink. Definitely recommend this place.	1
Always great people, outstanding food and great service.  If you haven't been the Bootlegger you are missing a great part of Vegas history and dining/entertainment.	1
It was a good and nice place to visit again. And the service is good too. It won't take too long to wait for the food when you get in if you use opentable to make a reservation. It just took me 5 mins online to book the seat. Therefore, it is extremely convenience for me to go there and get in without waiting.	1
Went there last week and had fish and chips. Got sick for 3 days . !!!	0
try the shwarma plate it's delicious!	1
We had a terrible experience at the cafe...staff was non-existent and food was not what it should have been. Ingredients were old, seafood was fishy, meat was overcooked. Very upsetting, nobody minds spending on meals as long as it is a good product.	0
You&#39;ll pay extra for the history and hours of the place, but nonetheless, as a cornerstone of the Los Angeles culinary scene, everyone needs at least one 3am breakfast order in their life&#39;s CV.	1
Oh, there is a God. <br><br>Little Choc Apothecary just opened and claims to be NYC&#39;s &#34;first all-vegan creperie.&#34; I literally fell over with excitement. No cheese, no gluten, nothing to worry about. I can get literally anything on the menu without fumbling over explanations for why I need to leave out butter, or whipped cream, or milk, or... you get the idea. <br><br>I wanted to try literally everything on the menu. Everything. I settled with Room for Mushroom, but come on, I have to go back and try &#34;Newtella&#34; (the homemade dairy-free nutella). and all the desserts, and juices to make me feel like I can undo all the indulgences. Who wants to go on a date with me EVERY DAY until I finish eating my way through their menu? Even their hot chocolate is vegan!<br><br>Finally, I can truly use the title of my favorite Yelp list here. Legen-non-dairy! Fine, fine, I&#39;ll admit it. I guess there is *some* use to Williamsburg being trendy-hipster-overrun. <br><br>PS- their Kickstarter campaign video is adorable!	1
I've been to La Brea Bakery maybe 6 or 7 times since they opened. I'm happy to say that with one exception, they have really started to hit their stride. The service was friendly and attentive. Yay. The food well realized. The only thing that is really subpar still is their coffee--which I know. I actually warned my coffee loving friend from Seattle when we were deciding between La Brea and Sycamore Kitchen. The room is lovely-airy and light. The baked goods are excellent. One thing that is odd to me is that there are beautiful prepared salads and pastries that you see when you walk in, but not mentioned on the menu anywhere. If you ask, you can get them, but why not put them on the menu? Really that food looks more interesting than what is on the menu. Anyway, very happy to see the improvements. Will keep coming back. The turkey sandwich is a favorite.	1
The food is ok. Lunch is pretty good. But they should hire better people at the cash register. People that know customer service and don&#39;t have a bitchy know it all attitude.	0
Enjoyed a lovely dinner in this vibrant busy restaurant. The food was great service excellent & just a slightly-too-long delay between courses but for dinner this just allowed us to enjoy the ambience.	1
Only reason it gets two stars is because the sausage on the pizza was yummy...where to begin...the only thing the server and assistant cared about was clearing the table, the hostess walked by our table a total of 12 times and we tried to get her attention about 12 times for silverware and she kept walking, when we finally got someone's attention it was an inconvenience for us to get silverware, and our waitress to get a second drink, am sure this won't get posted so sending their nice Holiday card back to them the old fashioned way by snail mail, and it gives me hope that service is by gadgets at least it will be more responsive	0
Truly, I do not understand those 5* reviews. <br>We have tried the cabbage, the squids, and the blade steak. ALL 3 dishes had too much salt. Why? Haven&#39;t you guys heard that this is not healthy? This was not just my opinion, my girlfriend said the same thing. The blade steak , that ppl dying for here at Yelp was chewy, salty and therefore tasteless. This was my first time there and the last one.	0
Syrups desserts or a filling sandwichSorry syrups but a full stomach will satisfy anyoneGetting off work at 3AM in downtown is like weird and scaryI had decided to skip desert for my lunch which is at midnightand decided to get a feel for home away from home from LA CafeLocated on spring street in DTLA the atmosphere walking was like a well lit modern for people on the goI walked in and it was quite lively at 3AM in the morningOrdered a Grilled Lobster sandwich which came with fresh potato chips on the side5 Min Later My sandwich is brought out to meBiting in to the ooey gooey goodness i was stunned by how remarkable the sandwich tasted as it was crispy and softMy only complaint was the saltiness in the sandwich which was a tad higher than i expected.overall Customer service was awesome, whether it be to keep the homeless from stealing my bag and food (true story) or helping me find the first bus that took me back home at 4AMP.S. the parklet next to the cafe (mini-park) has exercise equipment as well as a table and gamesjoin in and relax while you can	1
Lovely place for a lovely meal. <br><br>YUMS<br>: Fried oyster sandwich - meaty, succulent, a thing of perfection. <br>: Halibut carpaccio - WOW, absolutely ridiculous. Crisp, cold, paper-thin slices of halibut on toasted flat bread. One for the senses. <br>: Rice balls - fried, cheesy, need I say more?<br><br>UMS<br>: Fried quail &amp; polenta waffles - trying to mimic a Roscoe&#39;s Chicken &#39;n Waffles thing, but falling way short of the same satisfaction. I liked the tenderness and gaminess of the quail, but the fried battered skin was a bit much for such a delicate bird. Would not get it again.	1
Gotta tell you I was super skeptical when making a res at Perch. It was for my husband's birthday, he's super picky and pretty jaded and I was scared it was going to just be a scene with a great view. Well, I couldn't have been more off. The view WAS ridiculous and our table by the fireplace couldn't have been more divine. Felt like I was in Paris with the great drink list, or at the very least NYC. The food was INSANE. Having studied French cooking for two summers in France, again, was ready to complain. Nope. Cheese plate with perfect amount I quince paste. Short ribs with to-die-for, not shy horseradish, veggie terrine and RIDONCULOUS white chocolate bread pudding, not a competitor in town. Really great value and even a good spot for me to make a pit stop for the next date night. J'adore!	1
Soju Bloody Mary is SO good!	1
Deep fried pig everything. Cannot taste anything, but crunchy and salty. Disappointed. Will not go again.	0
Been going here for about thirty years. It&#39;s much pricier than most burger joints. So, let your price worries go when judging. You&#39;ve been warned. The fries are either one of the best in L.A. or just okay, depending on what I have no idea. The steakburger is one of L.A.&#39;s classics. I love the Tillamook cheddar cheese. I love the relish. It has too much lettuce though. I asked for less once, but was given an indignant look by one of the servers who I think was there the first time I ate there. As said, I only did that once. And I&#39;m not at all bashful. I think I just felt like I perpetrated a crime, without feeling guilty about it.<br><br>I had a sandwich once instead of a burger, cos they looked so good when i saw them. It was really good. I can&#39;t remember which one it was. I love getting a Dr. Pepper there and drinking it in the paper cone they give you, full of ice. I love the glass bottles of Heinz ketchup. <br><br>They&#39;re named for pie. The apple pie is pretty good, but there is a huge dome of air because they don&#39;t use pie birds. Not sure what to think about that. The Dreyer&#39;s ice cream that they have to get with the pie is the best vanilla ice cream I&#39;ve ever had. Where the hell do they get it? It&#39;s like triple super duper french vanilla. <br><br>Yes, I will go to the Apple Pan periodically for as long as I live in or visit L.A. I guess I am more than a fan. This is one of my childhood haunts.	1
Overall, Excellent. <br>Friendly staff, outstanding food. Priced fairly for the portions, taste, and atmosphere. <br>We ordered Asian style calamari, truffle Mac n cheese, glazed pork chop, skirt steak, and crispy skinned salmon. All were perfect. <br>Dessert was chocolate fondue with fruit. <br>We will definitely return.	1
I went for their lunch special, but they ran out of soup. They also ran out of eggrolls. They also ran out of curry. It took forty-five minutes for them to make new curry. <br><br>The extra star is for the service. Our waitress was very nice and apologetic about things which she couldn&#39;t control. <br><br>After I ate, I also ran out. I&#39;m not running back in either.	0
View of the water from the rooftop in fells point - lovely for an outdoor dining experience. The quality of the food is similar to their sister restaurant the Black Olive but considerably cheaper!	0
This place is a good old fashioned diner. You can actually feel the legitness of the old-fashionedness here. It wasn't some diner where they try to make it all clean and organized and brand-new, you can tell this place has been around for a while.The food was good, it was kind of greasy but that's the way I like my food. The amount of hashbrowns they give you is insane. You can literally have a whole meal just by eating the hashbrowns. The sourdough toast /w jam is good, the sausage is good (although they could be bigger), the eggs (i got them scrambled) was good, the pancakes were pretty soft and good. I don't think they serve waffles though.I think they charge a tiiiny bit too much for certain food, but that's fine. Pretty good place, I'm not surprised that it stayed in business this long.	1
I have been coming here for about 28 years. Seems like the place never changes. Feels like you step back in time. The food is very good, its an experience every time you are there. It's nothing fancy, but you know you are in Los Angeles, by all the different types of people that walk through the door. I feel like I enjoy my meal, and get some free entertainment also by people watching. Open 24 hours, so a great place to go late at night. Smoked Turkey Reuben, and Mishmosh Matzah ball soup is my favorite.	1
I love Little Dom's. What I don't love are pushy waitresses. Read your client. If they are not in a hurry, quit asking what they want. The artichoke was not as good as it usually is, but the crab fritters and beet salad were very good. The brussel sprouts needed more bacon, but the meatloaf was delicious. Gnochi was too saucy without enough gnochi. The squash fritters were very good. I also reccomend the Genuine Risk, a lovely easy going red.	1
MAKE A RESERVATION - thank me later. <br><br>I&#39;m so glad that I made a reservation for brunch with my girlfriends. When we got there, there were plenty of people waiting for a table or even sitting in the sun. Because we had a reservation, we got seated in a cute little booth, in the shade, with the best view ever. <br><br>Brunch food was priced very affordably, considering it&#39;s a fancier place to dine. If you check in on yelp, you get a free order of fries. Most of us ordered the lasagna pancakes. Great portion for just over $10. We got a carafe mimosa which was $18 and came out to about 6 mimosa glasses. Then we got a round of patron shots. You definitely get your money&#39;s worth because the shots are huge!<br><br>Service: our server Andrew was super cool. Super helpful with recommendation on food and checking up on us whenever he thought we were done with our meal. Also, other workers checked up on us to see if we needed more water or wanted another carafe. My water cup was never less than half full before it was refilled again. <br><br>Overall: great place for brunch. I was obviously expecting dishes to be over $30 for a small portion of food but everything was basically under $15 and the view was amazing. The best part, free parking across the street!! The guy said we didn&#39;t have to pay so we got lucky :) definitely coming back!	1
After MUCH debate as to where to go for brunch this morning, we finally decided on Tilikum, mostly based on high Yelp reviews, appealing pictures, and what appeared to be good windows for people watching. We had considered another option, Grub, purely for a sandwich described in the Brunch edition of Seattle Met. There was jam involved, it was hard to pass up. In the end, Tilikum won out- no regrets here! We got in around 1:30, (brunch goes until 2:00 on Sunday), and had to wait about 20 minutes for a table. About the time it took to walk to the space needle and back. We sat at the bar, started off with Bloody Marys. House made Mary mix was on point, served with pickled onion, green bean and lemon slice. Good amount of heat too which is always nice. We found out the special was The Monte Christo, which consists of a thinly sliced ham and gruyere cheese sandwich with ricotta and jam, entirely fried. You would think it would be more greasy, but it was surprisingly crisp the entire way through. And I'm a stickler about crispiness. It was SOO good. Out of the 3 options for Dutch babies, we went with the sweet ones with has pears sprinkled in, topped with toasted almonds. Also delicious with the side of maple syrup. Oh, also the espresso was a perfect post brunch drink as well! The bartender was fantastic too- all the staff really. Everything was great, definitely coming back. The omelets looked really good too, would like to try one of those sometime. Wondering if they have a happy hour though..	1
I love coming to the Shrimp Lover or just ordering in for a great night of seafood and a movie. Great family place and they have beer/wine for dine in. The prices can be a tad bit high but it&#39;s definitely worth it.	1
I don&#39;t know what it is about little gems in the middle of the most unexpected areas but they always have my heart. The name really says it all. A tiny shopping center, a busy street, parking on the roof, graffiti on the walls, people sitting on their front porches across the street watching you like you&#39;ve invaded their space. But just like that, even with all the surroundings, in this little hidden corner, I walk in and feel like I am back in Barcelona. <br><br>The cook came out, explained the specials, shared some stories and magically worked the tables and the kitchen. It truly feels like you are at some distant Tio&#39;s house in Spain. Mismatched chairs, pantries stocked with goodies, hanging pots and pans, the cook talking to you from the kitchen. This is no ordinary restaurant. This was home with a menu.<br><br>We had more tapas than I can remember. My favorite were the spinach croquetas and the paella. My only disappointment was the cheese platter. I expected more, but just not the type of thing you go there for in my opinion. Dessert was homemade chocolate truffles and were delicious. <br><br>What makes this place stand out from other Spanish restaurants I&#39;ve been to is the ability to not let anyone feel like they are just another customer being waited on. When you&#39;re here, you&#39;re family and you feel that from the very moment you walk in.	1
East Williamsburg has a new gem! This might not even sound possible, but this &#34;farm to fork eatery&#34; is both decadent AND wholesome. Casual and welcoming, with a warm, well-trained staff, AWOL features small plates that are plenty large enough to be shared and delicious enough that you&#39;ll want to order them all. Mains include pizzas and the best array of sliders anywhere (I suggest the Quinoa one.) It is VERY veg friendly but don&#39;t miss the short rib slider if you swing that way. Beer and wine cocktails are inventive...and you won&#39;t need a stiff one when the bill comes. I suspect AWOL will be tough to get into soon--so go go go while they are still making a name for themselves!	1
My husband and I were in the neighborhood, hungry for pizza, and wanted to try somewhere we hadn&#39;t been before. Emily pops up on Yelp and we head right over. It was still a bit early in the evening, so getting a table was no problem. <br><br>While the menu is a bit small, there are still more than enough choices for everyone. We settled on sharing The Wrestler (sauce, mozzarella, pepperoni, black olives, mushrooms) and waiting patiently as we watched the nifty pizza oven do its work.<br><br>Our pizza arrived even quicker than we expected and, oh yeah, it was super-delicious! I would call it a medium-sized pizza, so I ate half and he ate half. We felt happily full at the end of our meal and glad that we chose to come. <br><br>We&#39;d definitely come back here again and I highly recommend it for a date night - intimate and delicious :)	1
Best burger in Madison:	1
Color me underwhelmed. I&#39;ve been wanting to go to Bogota for awhile, and finally made it here when a friend came to visit from out of town. So maybe it was my high expectations, but I just didn&#39;t think the food was that great.<br><br>The food took about half an hour to get there -- but to make it all right, they gave us some plantain chips which turned out to be better than anything we actually ordered. I had the vegetarian tacos with tostones and kale. The tacos were fine -- tasty tortilla, your average sauteed vegetables, none of the queso-fresco-and-sour-creamy goodness you get from a taco joint in Sunset Park or something -- and the kale was quite good, but the tostones were so tough and dry as to be almost inedible, which is a shame because I usually love them.<br><br>Maybe it was because it was a Friday night, and the place was packed? Maybe our food was waiting in the kitchen for half an hour? Maybe not ordering drinks was our mistake? In any event, next time I&#39;ll go across the street to Los Pollitos. It may not be nearly as trendy, but there&#39;s no wait, the food is fresh, and it costs about half as much.	0
The food is whatever but the service is really bad. Me and my girlfriend came here and we were not really sure what to do with the wrapped oysters. At the time, the restaurant was not that busy and after struggling with it a few minutes with the waitress watching us , we finally had to ask the waitress to come over. When she came over, she acted like we were bothering her and was really unhappy. We drove a hour to eat here and while we were semi satisfied with the food the service is why turned us off a lot.	0
Pyramid is a great restaurant on non game day and on a game day they're crowded and noisy with the folks trying to eat and drink before going to the game. The foods good the beer is great the service is great if you don't show up on a game day. I've been there on a game day and I don't know how they keep up with the crowd but somehow they manage.	1
I was recommended to this place for some cheap food by my friend. I think he comes here when he&#39;s drunk/hungover. I was too sober for this. Our entire table got the steak eggs for $5.99 at around 12am when we had just arrived in Vegas. My dining experience was pretty much ruined by weirdos and loud skanky girls.	0
In downtown, i just have been few places, this is one of them, pretty nice service and good taste though.	1
Legit, honest, and very comfortable.<br><br>The place has a diner feel.<br><br>Parking lot is very small so if you can&#39;t find any space don&#39;t worry just park on the streets.<br><br>And basically how you seat yourself is hover around a person so scatter your group LOL.<br><br>Waiters there are genuinely nice. I think it was cash only since they used old style cash registers.	1
The steak burger was pretty good. Never got the chance to eat here because it&#39;s always packed so I always take my order for to go which they make really fast. They&#39;re burgers are really good but not the best for me.	1
What a weird drop off from first visit to second. First time I went, the octopus taco was so amazing I got another right away. This time, it was chewy and weird. Some noticeable quality drops in other dishes as well. C'mon petty cash!! Don't get lazy!!!!!I wish it didn't say "Meh. I've experienced better" when you click two stars. I would never say "Meh." I can't get behind that.	0
We've dined at Bistro Blanc in Glenelg many times and have always enjoyed our meals, but on our latest visit, the chef truly outdid himself.  We began with the crispy Brussels sprouts in a maple and lime glaze and the soup du jour, a split pea with pork belly and apple salad. The soup was inventive and complex, with anise, cardamom, Vietnamese cinnamon and black and white pepper adding  a spicy punch to the broth. A small micro-salad served atop croutons sat in the middle of the bowl. This was totally unexpected and a true gastronomic treat. Our entrees included the lamb burger and the absolute star of the evening, the grouper. The burger was cooked perfectly and served with crisp, fresh cut fries. The grouper was perhaps the best seafood dish I have ever had in a restaurant--it was cooked perfectly with flesh that had an almost creamy texture.  It was served atop a heavenly mix of roasted edamame &amp; hazelnut chutney, wild hedgehog mushrooms, pickled pearl onions, and micro arugula.  A burnt miso 'butterscotch' emulsion also adorned the plate .  I'm usually not at a loss for words when describing my dining experiences here on OpenTable, but this dish left me speechless and bested meals we have had at Volt, Alchemy, Highland Inn and Tersiguel's.  Bartender/waiter Andy provided wonderful service and solid menu recommendations, as usual.  A fantastic job all around, Bistro Blanc.  Thank you!	0
Very slow service if you get this skinny white chick that looks like Jessica Biel.	0
A small Korean restaurant specializing in abalone porridge. It's not really a cafe. Cafe--you think coffee and pastries, but this place is definitely NOT a cafe. It's your comfort Korean food restaurant. I got the abalone porridge, which was very tasty. I mixed it with the raw egg they put on top of it. The amount was filling. I haven't tried anything else, but I am assuming that you should come here mostly if you just are craving for good abalone porridge. The selection isn't as good as Bon Juk for juks. IF you want PAHT JUK or Pumpkin JUK, go to Bon Juk or somewhere else. The venue is VERY VERY small. Very crowded but when I went there weren't much people, although it got packed the moment my friends and I left.Recommended!	1
Awesome Food! The Best!	1
I liked the view. The food was average, nothing to rave about. I&#39;ve had A LOT better, I&#39;ve had a LOT worse. I think I will stick with the drinks here, since really, it&#39;s all about the view. The tables were cramped but the outdoor dining area is very limited so that was to be expected. <br><br>The service was great. We were seated right away and the waitress was helpful and attentive. <br><br>Honest opinion, skip dinner and go for drinks and sociable atmosphere.	1
Ingredients always fresh, very yummy. Be patient with the service is not the greatest. I always order to go or delivery,	1
Came for brunch (really, it was nearly 2 PM), and were it not for their $15 bottomless mimosas, this place would be dismal. I had the short rib hash... seriously, not a dash of salt was used in that dish. It needed hot sauce, flavor, anything! I tried taking my left overs home, but anyone who's ever tried to salvage breakfast foods know they are inedible. Thankful the mimosas were good. I also had a bite of the eggs Benedict. I guess pretty standard as far as eggs Benedict is concerned. Did I mention the mimosas? With all the eateries in the area I'd venture elsewhere next time, but thank God for those mimosas.	0
While in Vegas most dine on the strip.  This restaurant has been around for a long time.  It may be a short drive from the strip but it is worth every mile you drive.  Food is fantastic and its an old world place to eat.  A Great Experience.  I will go back again next year.	1
My boyfriend and I have been here a few times now, and we always leave quite satisfied. The fish quality is great, and they have great dinner specials. I mean, 3 specialty rolls for $25.00 is a phenomenal deal! The service is always pleasant, and the restaurant ambiance is relaxing. If you are looking for good sushi at great prices, I recommend Ohjah.	1
This place is adorable. The view, the overall atmosphere, the French music, and the truffle mac n cheese! Happy girl, I was.Came for happy hour on a Friday and was seated right away. I was told the line to get in is usually crazy. Got lucky, I guess.I ordered a raspberry flavored glass of champagne. Nothing special. The bf ordered a Jacques Collins, which was mostly ice, but delish! The fresh lemon in it was refreshing.Lots of variety on the happy hour menu, but we decided to go with beef sliders and the truffle mac n cheese. The sliders were bland and came out cold. Reminded me of the frozen kind you get at the grocery store. MEH! The truffle mac n cheese was a different story. So, so tasty!Definitely coming back.. mostly because the place is so cute and the view really can't be beat.	1
Warning: this place is SMALL!!Otherwise I really did love everything about The Far Bar! It was a cute place for a friend and I to sit down, grab a drink and just catch up. We stopped in on a Wednesday night so the place was relatively deserted and a great place to just chill and talk.We ordered two gin and tonics (although the drink menu looked promising) and wasabi fries - the total bill was $22. If you have a small party, definitely check it out!	1
This is an all you can eat steakhouse. They keep coming until you say stop.	0
Definitely the best tacos I have ever had!! Very friendly staff & cool space.	1
I&#39;ve been here several times, and have tried something different each time. Here&#39;s what I liked and didn&#39;t like:<br><br>Really Liked:<br>- Polish Sausage: crisp, meaty, tasty, and filling<br>- Giardiniera: good flavor and a very nice kick<br>- Gyro: the meat is juicy, and the fresh made tzatziki is excellent<br><br>Liked:<br>- Hot dogs: pretty good, but I&#39;ve had better Chicago dogs; nothing that especially stands out<br><br>On the Fence:<br>- Italian beef: maybe it&#39;s just the one I had, but it was oddly bland<br>- Fries: a little too hard, a little too salty<br><br>Didn&#39;t Like:<br>- Pizza puff: kind of a greasy mess<br><br>Overall, though, the food there I like outweighs the food I&#39;m neutral towards or don&#39;t like. The folks there are also very friendly and they always have ESPN on at least one screen, which is a plus for me. I definitely recommend WCBND, especially their polish sausage and gyro.	1
I hate to have to put this place on blast because I liked it so much, but according to my friend it&#39;s already been on the Hills, so whatever. <br><br>Was taken here for a Sunday brunch double date by my best friend Mariam before the boyfriend and I had to fly back to the Bay. <br><br>Loved, Loved, LOVED it!!! It was so cute!! The ambiance and atmosphere was great!! The food was super yummy, great breakfast as well as lunch dishes. I highly recommend the Falafel Wrap. I was a bit hesitant when my boyfriend wanted to order it, cus I feel like Middle Eastern food needs to come from a Middle Eastern restaurant in order to be good. However, Toast&#39;s rendition of it was pretty spot on to authentic (lavash wrap and all. Pita would&#39;ve been better, but i love me some lavash!).<br><br>Mariam ordered the French Toast. Sooooo good!! I typically don&#39;t allow myself such rich things, but I did snag a bite and Yum-O!!<br><br>All in all I&#39;m adding Toast to my LA food hit list!! Also, if you ever need to go sunglass browsing, this is the place to do it. Granted it&#39;s LA and everyone where&#39;s shades, but this place had all different types, sizes, and colors. So stop by Toast for brunch before you hit up the mall for new shades :oP	1
Very comfortable burger place with good food but not a place to go if you intend to talk - it isn&#39;t possible unless you do sign language. It is a real turn off	0
A great disappointment to our evening out before Opera in the Park."I'm sorry, but I can't create tables out of thin air. You'll have to go somewhere else - all I can offer you is the manager's phone number.... I'm sure you can find better food elsewhere."On the Monday prior, I made a reservation for four people for a Friday evening. Then, I called back on the day of to increase the reservation to eight people. What I - or, should I say, we - could not believe is that upon arriving at Brickhouse, both servers said they had no record of our reservation. Two calls in, two confirmations of our reservation, then... nothing.On top of this, the second server - a colorfully attired woman with a sharp demeanor - was quite rude to us. There was zero empathy for the restaurant's mistake, and little concern for us ever returning to actually try the food. See quote above.I scrambled to find another place to eat for eight on a warm Friday evening, and made the coordinating calls to get everyone there. After a bit of a wait, we managed to get a table at nearby 21st Amendment and arrived in time for the start of the opera at AT&T Park.Shame on you, Brickhouse Cafe.p.s. I am pleased to see that this particular review single-handedly dropped the average from four stars to three-and-a-half. Slainte!	0
Never too crowded, food is good, and the prices are right, but it&#39;s the atmosphere that really seals the deal -- I always feel like I&#39;m getting VIP treatment when I&#39;m in there, and the music adds a little swank to that particular corner on Grand.	1
This is the best Rueben in Los Angeles and thankfully it&#39;s open all night long. I&#39;ve been coming here forever and have never been disappointed.	1
At one time I would have given this place a solid 5 stars. Over time it has definitely lost it&#39;s charms. When I first went in late 2008 I was really impressed- New American locavore fare served by a thorough and conscientious waitstaff. I went back many times until I took my Mother for a nice dinner. She came from very far away and I wanted to treat her to some of Brooklyn&#39;s finest dining and I felt that Applewood fit the bill. The entire experience was disastrous. Our only shining moment came in the beginning as the lovely Matron&#39;D seated us and asked us how our day was. It all went downhill swiftly from there. Our first plates took forever. They got them wrong. The entree my Mother ordered was extremely overcooked (she ordered veal sweetbreads from the specials menu, what she got resembled pork cracklings both in appearance and in taster) My meat was extremely overcooked. The desserts were the size of my fingernail. And to add injury to insult, everyone of my amazing Ommegang Abbey Ales was poured with the most outrageous head, even despite my efforts to grab it away from his bumbling hands. I&#39;ll say this, I haven&#39;t been back in a while, but it got steadily worse and worse each time I dined here. Maybe I&#39;ll give it another shot, because in the beginning as I mentioned this was indeed a 5 star place as many reviewers have given it.	0
The Doughroom , as for the pizza and salad I must say met my tastebuds in a good way to make them very happy ! i loved the sour beer but was a bit pricey served in a small look alike wine glass, due to that pricey small portion a star was taken away.... server Tyson was on Point	1
I want to like Oddfellows -- great space; simple comfort food. I've enjoyed a great latte and pastry. But a full lunch revealed that the secret is to order simple choices with good ingredients. The BLT and poached egg sandwich for example because how could you ruin brioche bread with a few good ingredients. The spinach salad however demonstrated the lack of caring that infects other dishes. Too small for $8 under-dressed and the farro and seemingly one green olive were too uninspiring to lift it beyond a plate of dry leaves. I actually saw the women at another table lift the plate of spinach salad up to stare closely with furrowed brows as if wondering whether this was it. The accompanying bread tasted a little tired (cut too early?) and was not served with butter. The cold corn soup was overly vegetal perhaps better suited to a cup than a full bowl.	0
Pretty boring food.I got the reuben, had their pickles. The reuben was below average quality, and they didn't even cook the dressing into the sauerkraut - critical part of making a reuben. The corned beef in it was pretty flavorless. Their pickles tasted kind of off. Their fries were steak fries at least - probably the best part of the meal.It's cool they're famous and all, but for $14 for a reuben you better blow me away. Not even close.	0
Great sandwiches and baked goods! Reuben's sandwich is especially awesome here! And in the bakery, they have this marzipan cookie that is AMAZING!I have to say though.. I tried their Monte Cristo sandwich, and did not like that at all. It wasn't a real Monte Cristo.Overall, Canter's is a great place to go with family. It's been around for a long time and gained a great reputation with it. Portions are definitely generous and good for sharing. Service is very friendly also!	1
ENVIRONMENT<br>Kaya is in the style of a quick service restaurant similar to Chipotle. The staff are very helpful and ask is it&#39;s your first time and also encourage sampling to determine what you want. A brilliant idea since not everyone is good at building your own Southeast Asian dish. <br><br>FOOD<br>You can choose to build your own rice bowl, salad, wrap or tacos.<br><br>For protein you can choose steak, chicken or an interesting shrimp and pork meatball.<br><br>Then veggies and sauce.<br><br>VIOLA!	1
Bland. What happened to healthy but still flavorful? somewhat pricey for what you get. Not worth it.	0
My friend could not stop talking about this place. So we went and Oh... my... gosh... those were some amazing burgers! Some people may not like the portion size of the burger but I think it's just right to a point where it makes you full and satisfied but not stuffed and sickly. Granted though.. I do believe they're a little pricey. Maybe a few dollars more than what I would like to spend but who knows why they're that expensive? Then again... how savory and flavorful each burger is maybe it is worth it?I ordered the Umami Burger and I loved it. I took a bite of my boyfriend's and friend's burger, the Carnitas Burger and the Port & Stilton burger. Both were superb! I even had a little bit of my friend's fries (I think they were thin fries with cheese but can't tell you for sure) but nonetheless they were very flavorful. Maybe a little too much for my preference... I probably would not have been able to finished the entire order of sides because the flavor was so strong. I also like their old-fashion and unique flavored sodas. I had the non-alcoholic ginger beer (I know, weird) and I loved it... even my boyfriend that hates ginger liked it. As for the service I think it was pretty good. Our waitress took awhile but the place seemed busy. She was attentive and answered all my friend's questions with a great attitude and also checked up on us frequently throughout our meal. Also... we LOVED our flamboyant server. He was so much fun. Pity the staff doesn't wear nametags. When he brought out our friend's fries he said, "Careful the plate's hot... just like me. :::chuckle::" :)One complaint I do have is the table we had. Granted it is Los Feliz so pretty much all restaurants have half of their tables sitting on the sidewalk but mine and my friend's chairs were on the edge of a small slope and could've easily fallen back if we had moved just inches back. We couldn't move the table too far the other direction because my other friend's seat was in direct line of the door and could've been hit if someone were to be too zealous when opening the door. Overall I really love this place. Granted I won't be visiting this place as much as I like since it IS a little pricey and the ABSOLUTE WORST part was trying to find parking. I'm not big on valeting because I'm paying someone to park my car when I can just add a few steps of exercise to my day.	1
Sunny Crisp was AMAZING. Great sushi!	1
Yum yum yum...	0
This place has amazing food and amazing staff. they are really sweet and care about their food and customer service. The restaurant itself is nice and relaxing and the food was better than I expected it to be. One of the best Thai restaurants in Vegas for me, I&#39;ve been looking forever for good Thai food In Vegas and finally found it. Happy I gave this place a try.	1
This place is overrated. Wanted to take my family to have some good pancakes and this place had a lot if good reviews so tried it out. The place decor is like some bodies house with no furniture. I was like wtf? <br><br>Place had a bit if a wait which is usually good sign of it being good. Service was a total fail. Took forever to get my drink order and then coffee came out first then another 5 mins for my daughters drinks. Took forever to get guys attention to order and then took even longer to get food. I&#39;m a very patient person but service was all over the place.<br><br>So many things went wrong. Bacon was burnt and pancakes were dry. This experience was so sad. I had to get up to get more coffee. People around me were waiting a long time too. They really need to work their operation. I hope they fix it but either way I won&#39;t be back.	0
The food was delicious. I am a huge fan of risotto, and this place did not let me down. The staff is super friendly and brought me a surprise dessert for my birthday that my table didn&#39;t even order! I&#39;m so happy this place is on my block because now I can go there all the time. There is no liquor license but they will happily uncork and pour any wine you bring with you. Go.	1
Garlic chickens are delicious and full of flavor!Lots and LOTS of garlic.If you are a garlic lover like me, I highly recommend it!Hot sticks are just hot enough. they are plump, juicy, crispy yet spicy.perfect combo huh?I also like furaibo chicken however, they are too thin and dry. and I agree with PUFF S that their chicken is the best quality of all the other korean chicken joints 1 less star for the LONG wait.	1
Considering the pollo asado is sitting out for so long, I don&#39;t know how it stays so good. But it is.<br>I only wish that El Palacio de los Jugos had more vegetable options. They serve monstrous rice portions, which never feels like a good idea after the fact. Unfortunately, all they offer otherwise is maduros, tostones, yuca, etc. The typical starchy Cuban stuff. That&#39;s all good every now and then, but the mixed vegetables are a pretty sad healthy alternative. If they did a potaje de garbanzo or even sliced tomatoes with olive oil, that would be great (and easy enough to prep that they could pull it off).	1
Pissed....its open till 6am...we got therebY 2:30 and we were told it was closed!!!!!! The one star was only because I can&#39;t give zero...very disappointed	0
Just an average Italian Family Style place to hit up in Times Square if you want to avoid Carmine&#39;s extra long wait. Food was just average and a bit overhyped. <br><br>Baked Clams: extremely on the salty side. Had better elsewhere<br>Veal Marsala: Bland<br>Rigatoni a la Vodka: it wasn&#39;t al dente like some of the reviews stated<br>Tartufo: The best I had for the night!	0
This place is real tasty and a good deal. For $6.50, you get a grilled chicken and rice platter with salad. The best part is that they use tzatziki sauce because lately I&#39;ve been kinda disgusted by the white/mayo sauce from the halal carts. <br><br>FYI: sometimes the line gets long and it gets somewhat hectic. <br><br>PSA: Free Transfer Available For You!!! <br>Ok...I&#39;m not sure how this works, but this is what I do. I take the 4,5,6 to 59th street and then walk over to Tony&#39;s. Once i get my order, i walk to the Lexington/63rd station and transfer to the F for free when using the same metrocard. So basically i got off the train and scored me a delicious plate at no extra commuting charge. Let me know if it works for you also...	1
This place clearly doesn't read the reviews on here, because nothing has changed and I have experienced some of the same aforementioned issues... They have forgotten my "super" at least 3 separate times, and the chips have been stale the last few times I've been to the Fulton location. Time to figure it out; either drop your prices to make up for the shortcomings of the kitchen, or make sure they're making the damn food correctly! The 2 stars is because I really have experienced better, and expect better!	0
***Drew**** completely saved our experience here yesterday evening. A friend recommended this place for the food, so my girlfriend and I thought we would check it out. <br><br>Our server took our drink and appetizer order and then completely disappeared for 15 minutes, and for the rest of our experience honestly. Drew noticed that we weren&#39;t being taken care of, and completely picked up the slack even though he was already serving multiple tables. By the time our actual server even glanced towards our table, he noticed that our menus had been collected and briefly said &#34;oh, did someone do your order.&#34; Drew refilled our waters, brought us our appetizer, took our meal order, checked on us once we had our food, and gave us our check. Our actual server did none of those things and only stopped by at the end to run our card. <br><br>Long story short, we were both so impressed by Drew. Never once did we get the sense that he was annoyed by the fact that he was taking on someone else&#39;s workload. He was so professional, so incredibly personable, and we loved the food suggestion he gave us!<br><br>THANK YOU DREW!	1
Management here SUCKS! They would take a to-go order by phone claiming they're too busy. Taking a look around they're not busy at all.	0
I probably had the worst dining experience of my life coming here on Valentine&#39;s day. <br><br>BOTTOM LINE: Service is outrageously slow and nothing to write home about. Food - decent if you&#39;re starving.<br><br>The staff was friendly and courteous and helped us to our table immediately since we had a reservation at 8 pm. We were seated around the same time as two other couples near us and We were located in the patio area towards the end of the restaurant. We received the Valentine&#39;s Day specials menu as well as the regular menu, and that&#39;s where I noticed that the price of the lobster ravioli was more expensive on the &#34;specials&#34; menu. Hmm? Interesting, I thought. The same exact item, but more expensive...<br><br>My date and I ordered calamari as an appetizer along with water for the both of us. We received yummy warm bread and this tapenade spread, which my date and I were not a huge fan of. We spent quite a while waiting for our appetizer, even after we ordered our main dish. It had to be at least 45 minutes after we had been seated when our waiter came back out and informed us that they were out of calamari. Ok. Great... In the mean time, the waiter brought us a ceviche-type appetizer, which I wasn&#39;t a fan of. I don&#39;t like fish, but my date liked it. The other couples were finally starting to receive their dinner while my date and I were still waiting. Our waiter finally came around to our table and tried to tell me what I ordered, cannelloni, would not be ready? I say &#34;tried&#34; to tell me because it was so loud and through the waiters accent I had lots of trouble understanding what he said. I was okay with waiting a bit longer, considering we had been there for over an hour already. The other couples got up and left, while we had. <br><br>No more bread and water... My date had enough and got up and spoke to the manager to ask about the status of our meals. He assured us he would look and offered us both wine and my date took a glass. About 15 minutes later, we FINALLY received our dinner! The cannelloni was delicious, and my date enjoyed his carbonara, but I&#39;m not sure if it was actually as good as I thought or because I was starving. The staff gave us a complementary tiramisu to share at the end of our meal. Maybe it was a poor choice to come here for Valentine&#39;s day, but I don&#39;t see myself ever coming back.	0
decent food but got grossed out when i saw that one of the girls making the ceviche wasn&#39;t using gloves.	0
I came in at 12:40 for lunch and it wasn&#39;t that busy. I ordered the rokburger medium done. It took 30 mins to get my food. Service was ok. I had to ask for a refill on drinks. The burger was ok. Extremely greasy. Whenever I took a bite the grease was dripping down my fingers and onto plate. They had to use 70/30 meat. I wont be back.	0
Nice decor!Yeah that's it. Got the tonkotsu deluxe with a side of pork belly...The soup didn't even look milky, it just looked like shoyu broth. Didn't taste milky, either, just salty. I kept hearing his place was good, either the ppl have low standards of ramen or I came on an off day. Still vote for tan popo for a Japantown ramen joint	0
The fried chicken here is no joke. Best food to grab after a night out on the town. You seriously won't regret it unless you get the spicy wings on accident because those are ridiculously hot. Other than the stupid valet for this place and the less than enthusiastic staff this place is on point.	1
Very good food. Got a few small plates amongst four people and enjoyed it all. Goat cheese bruschetta was amazing as was the rigatoni with boar. Cocktails were creative and delicious. Definitely recommend this place.	1
Pretty yummy soup. I like that you can customize and add extras.<br>I came with one other person and we ordered the spam and kimchi jjigae and added ramen noodles. We barely finished half the soup together. Their side dishes are pretty yummy, and the service is pretty good. I would definitely come back with 1 or 2 more people.	1
The food is always fine, not great but fine. However the service is horrible. We live very close but we won't be going back again. We have ordered apps that come 30 mins after ordering and they are cold. We have had apps come after the main course. It is an unprofessional front of house for sure.	0
Everything was bad from the start. The host greeted us with a bad attitude. We waited 15 mins for the server to show his face at the table. Meanwhile, we ordered some drinks and appetizers. The appetizers were ready in literally 30 SECONDS, clearly pre made. Keep in mind we had not yet received water nor our drinks. The first appetizer was the MeliMelo tartare which was not fresh. We complained and they responded &#34;we have the freshest fish in miami and in the country!!&#34; I&#39;ve had fresh tartar before and trust me...this was not fresh at all. Then, to top it off the 2nd appetizer was the burrata which had a piece of what they claimed to be shellfish, but it really looked like a dead cockroach leg. This happened even though we had already mentioned 3 people in our party were allergic to shellfish. <br><br>Overall, the service is mediocre, the food tasteless and not fresh, and water down drinks.<br><br>Do not recommend this place to anyone!	0
The cool thing about this restaurant is the intimacy achieved in a giant LV casino.  You feel like you are in a small restaurant.  We sat right next to the buffet, which was cool because that is where the jazz trio plays. They were really good, but not too loud.  They really regulate how many people are at the brunch at a time by limiting reservations.  When at the buffet, there were only one or two other people there with me.  By Vegas standards this buffet is tiny. It really feels like a hometown country club buffet...with the cool jazz trio.  Included in the buffet are items ordered off the menu.  My husband ordered the Wagyu hot dog and Eggs Benedict that had pulled pork.  Highlights from the buffet were the cold shrimp, they were delicious quality.  We didn't like the crab legs.  The shrimp and grits was terrific, and I loved the corn chowder, who knew?  They had several carved meats: two types of beef, ham and sausage.  They had raw oysters.  For dessert I liked the strawberry shortcake.  Overall it was such a relaxing way to spend a Sunday morning in crazy Vegas. I'd definitely go back.	1
Ate there Saturday noon and it was very disappointing. Service was very slow with wait staff standing around chatting with each other. My wife ordered Caesar Salad and they brought it with no dressing. We also had to ask for a fork three times. Her corn chowder was barely warm. I ordered Pad Thai and it was a congealed mess with little flavor. The Pad Thai at Noodles and Co. is far better. The people on both sides of us were complaining about service, it took 1 hour for them to get their soup and salad order. I noticed neither of them finished their soup. Real glad we didn't try them for dinner as lunch was expensive enough. So many better options in Madison.	0
Are the 5 star reviews here done only by Vietnamese Yelpers trying to be sympathetic towards people from their own country or something?? I&#39;m skeptical that NOBODY has complained about their weird ordering system. Let&#39;s stop hiding and be real people. Even though I&#39;m Korean I critique Korean restaurants in New York very carefully/seriously and if I have to be a total ass, I will. Again, if you&#39;re a true Yelper, plese BE REAL OK???? Now onto the review:<br><br>I wanted to like this place but after a horrible experience, I doubt I&#39;ll ever eat here again. So today, I was able to get off work early and since it was still bright outside and the weather was so gorgeous, decided to head over to Greenwich Village to grab a quick bite from one of the eateries in the area before heading back home. Passed by a number of restaurants and this place seemed really relaxed and casual from outside but went in to try this place out.<br><br>The problem happened as soon I got in line. The two Asian (they looked Vietnamese) girls that were in line n front of me were given a menu to look at and choose their food items while the Cashier lady (Vietnamese and seemed like she was the owner or the mistress perhaps?) waited patiently with a smile. Then, as soon as it was my turn, one of the male servers there takes away the menu from the girls and I was not even given a menu to look at. I was so lost that I had to &#34;re-ask&#34; them for the menu and the Cashier lady &#34;rolled&#34; her eyes. I said I needed some time and let the guy behind me go first. Turns out he wasn&#39;t ready either. After 5 seconds of browsing the menu, decided to get the Spicy Brisket Banh Mi. They asked for my name and didn&#39;t tell me anything afterwards. <br><br>Since the place seemed really casual and you literally order your food in line just like any other casual or fast food establishments, I unloaded my bag and about 5 minutes later, the Cashier lady brought me a plastic bag with the Banh Mi. As I was unwrapping the sandwich I noticed I didn&#39;t get any napkins so I went back to the register to get some napkins and the cashier lady gives me the most fucked up bitchy attitude saying &#34;You know this is a sit-down table service place right?&#34; and gives me a really dirty look. I was confused. I mean you order your food in line but then again, you offer table service?? What the fuck is that? At that moment, I was so mad and ready to explode so I packed up my food and headed towards Washington Square Park where I opened and finished my Banh Mi.<br><br>On the bright side, the Banh Mi was surprisingly good and it was pretty decent size. The brisket was juicy and had the right amount of spiciness with the jalapenos and crunchy carrots. Oh yeah, the bread was awesome too. So the one star I&#39;m giving is on the food only. You just lost 3 stars and a serious Food Connoisseur customer. Sorry won&#39;t be back.<br><br>***NOTE****<br><br>-CASH ONLY<br><br>-THIS IS NOT A CHIPOTLE type of establishment despite how it looks where you order your food in line and you bring your food to a table and help yourself but a very confusing system that they have of where you order in line, give them your name, then you wander around hopelessly and then they bring the finished product to you. Obviously retarded system.	0
We sat outside for about 20 minutes waiting for service and nothing. Had a couple waiters even peek outside. Waste of time.	0
Gave it one star just so I could rate it. Cheap- yea, but it&#39;s just a small baguette w a slice of cheese or 3 small, small shrimps. Don&#39;t waste your time, money, or calories.	0
This was my first visit. I love the interior decoration of this place. Clean. Had a really yummy sundae. A bit pricey though.	0
I&#39;ve not yet checked this place at night but judging from the bar and what&#39;s on tap that might be the time to come. Instead, since this place is stumbling distance away, I went here for brunch, but I&#39;ll be stumbling further on down fifth in the future. <br><br>First of all, we stopped by about 3 minutes before they open on Sunday and we&#39;re turned away. When we came back a little later we were escorted to the back room although the more appealing front area was entirely empty. The back room decor definitely would look better in low light. With the lights on the horrible chipped-up paint job, worse wall art and general clutter were all left exposed and gave the place a dumpy atmosphere. Our waiter, although competent, had a unique serving style that was maybe aiming for unobtrusive but came off as strange and inattentive. <br><br>Our coffee was european strong in a good sized cup, but our food was not impressive. The latka entree was small, the polenta (raved about here) made me wonder what previous yelpers were talking about, and the flatbread was a big puff of sweet overload. I&#39;ve travelled extensively through eastern Europe, lived in EE enclaves in the states, and love the cuisine, but I&#39;m sure any native eating here would have a few words for the chef. And maybe this is a more general gripe, but calling breakfast brunch doesn&#39;t warrant a $6 markup per plate.	0
Yesterday, March 11, 20154 of us enjoyed some tapas selections, 2 salads, chopped and fig and blue delicious.Shrimp was deliciousChicken tacos were goodCalamari was goodBeef in cherry (Beef we thought was overcooked) sauce was deliciousMeatballs very good	1
Great premise, beautiful concept but lacking in so many ways. The servers are woefully unprepared. Some of the food was excellent but several dishes spent too much time under the heat lamps turning med rare into med well. Needs work. Hope it lasts long enough to work out the kinks.	0
I've been a take-out customer for years until their sandwiches started becoming smaller and blander, and their dine-in service started to suck harder. That grandpa behind the counter sure gives a mean attitude when you ask him to add some cheese on your 'wich, sheesh... and forget about asking him for a side of pickles! So what if they are 24/7? So is Jerry's.Now for some shameless propaganda:CANTer's CAN'T make good sandwiches anymore.Canter's is overpriced and impersonal.Jerry's (insert greater than sign prohibited by Yelp) Canter's	0
Is it so? Can't be.	1
Blueberry pancakes. Got that? The. Blueberry. Pancakes. Best pancakes ever. Even better than Dottie&#39;s in San Francisco, if you&#39;ve been there and can believe it.<br><br>Next, the rice balls (on the all day lunch menu). Heaven. Absolutely. Cut one in half, yummy and fried, cheese oozing out from inside. EAT IT. You&#39;ll thank me.<br><br>The steak and poached eggs are also quite good, though never salted enough. But, you can add more.<br><br>Love going to this place for breakfast!<br><br>Note: for those who love booze with their breakfast, they have a full bar.	1
Great food.<br>The tapas is great!<br>Reasonable pricing.<br>One block from the ferry.<br>Entrees are really good too.<br>The lamb chops are amazing.<br>Sangria is great (but the bartender was a little cocky and arrogant - but maybe he had a bad day - the time before that he was cool)	1
I drive by The Wood all the time and have always been meaning to try it so I was happy when a friend wanted to have brunch there this past weekend. <br><br>They was a decent crowd when we got there, but it wasn&#39;t super packed. One of the waitresses practically pushed me out of the way and gave me a dirty look when I walked in, but I&#39;ll overlook that. Maybe she was just really busy. We sat down and looked at the menus. The waiter came by and asked for our drink orders and my friend made a joke while she was ordering, but this guy was not interested in being friendly or laughing. He had a very cold vibe. <br><br>Our drinks came quickly and we ordered our food and then waited... and waited... and waited... we watched everyone else&#39;s food come out as we were practically drooling. <br><br>When the food finally arrived, it was amazing. One of the best brunches I&#39;ve had in quite some time. The waiter never asked how we were doing during our meal, but I didn&#39;t expect that after seeing his attitude. We left a nice tip, but that&#39;s just how we roll. In reality, we should have barely tipped him... maybe that would help him understand that he&#39;s rude!<br><br>I&#39;m torn! I loved the food, but don&#39;t want to deal with slow service and bad attitudes. I&#39;ll probably give it one more shot because I really want to try their red velvet cupcake!<br><br>One other note: my friend and I both looked at our bank accounts online the next day and noticed that we were each charged twice.	0
Well what I can say. The tacos were off the hook! Very tasty and fresh. Everything taste home style. The waiters are attentive and nice. <br><br>I had the chips and salsa. Ammmmmmaxing salsa. One of the best I had in a long time. They also have amazing Guacamole! The chips that come with it are also fire. I also tried the chicken tacos. Perfection! The chicken is jidori with in house marinade, cilantro and onions. I had to try the Carne Asda. Which was grilled steak cilantro and onions with a huge piece of avocado. On top of those tacos I got a side of rice that tasted just like my moms!! Each taco order comes with two tacos. They are a little bit bigger than street tacos. <br><br>This place is great. The price of food could be better. It&#39;s pricey for lunch. Too bad they don&#39;t have a lunch deal. Two thumbs up!!	1
Great food and great atmosphere. Like the simplistic of the entrees and appetizers. Must try 30 hours Sous Vide Berkshire Pork Belly!!! Unexpected flavor combos that taste amazing! If your big fan of kimchi try &#34;Kimchi Pasta with Smoked Mackerel&#34; Nice selection of beers as well. Well done!!!	1
This place has one of the freshest foods and friendly fast service. Very well organized and punctual with your order. They've had some difficulties in the past with making sure everything's on point such as food orders delivery and most importantly Catherine so many ppl at once but it has gotten even better than few weeks ago.. Good job guys keep it up.	1
This place is absolutely amazing. Besides one of the best views in LA the drinks are great. I&#39;ve been to Perch on Friday and Saturday nights and their Happy Hour. Every time was a great crowd. No complaints.	1
Five words- Mac Daddy and Cheese Balls. Yummy yummy yummy. Who wouldn't like fried mac and cheese? Well that is just a small sample of the delicious things that Fred 62 has to offer. Delicious breakfast dishes, I personally love the Bearded Mr. Frenchy which is crunchy french toast. Great noodle bowls, sandwiches, salads and specialties. Their desserts are great, I have a thing for the apple punk tarts. This is one of my all time favorite late night dining restaurants in LA. The prices, while odd are actually pretty reasonable, the service is pretty good, and though there is often a wait for a table, they usually try their best to get you in ASAP. If you want some comfort food that thinks out of the box, come to Fred 62, you will be happily satisfied.	1
This was a great place to have dinner before a show at BAM. I loved the intimate space, the open windows and the open kitchen. It is a small space however, so prepare to get cozy with your neighbors!<br><br>We shared the octopus, avocado, sugar snap peas and chicken. My favorite was probably the snap peas, which was wonderfully fresh and light, while still flavorful and rich. I also really enjoyed the avocado - I hadn&#39;t thought I&#39;d have a new way to experience an avocado, but the peanuts and heat were a nice surprise. I also enjoyed my glass of gewurztraminer, which was very reasonably priced and delicious.	1
We sat down and waited for 10 minutes for someone to take our order. Staff members walked by multiple times, but none would take our completed order forms. We left and got food elsewhere.	0
I had high expectations for this place. The hostess wasn't very inviting and our waitress took forever. The crab cakes were really good and the greens were by far the best I've ever had. Other than that the food wasn't memorable. Max's Restaurant of the Philippines has better fried chicken and Hard Knox Cafe is all around just a better spot.	0
Foods are ok. <br>Service.. I asked for a refill on water a few times by talking to waitresses and pressing the call bell a few times but never got one. My table number displayed on a screen when I pressed the call bell but later they turned it off. They turn it off if they don&#39;t want to see a table number.On my way out, I saw a number displayed on the screen and someone get served for a refill of water..	0
Once again, this place doesn't disappoint. I came here again with a few friends Friday night. Unfortunately we decided to come here last minute so we weren't able to make a reservation. Once we got here we were told wait for 4 would take anywhere from 30 min to an hour. We were able to secure two seats at the bar for the ladies and had a few drinks. Throughout the hour, I went up to the host to check on the wait. Each time the host with a smile said that she would let us know when we were ready. Then suddenly without notice, the hostess comes up to me and says that our table isn't ready, but that there is a sofa section that is "first come, first serve" that just opened up and that we could drink and dine there instead. THAT IS AWESOME SERVICE. I was really impressed with her going out of her way to help us out. I couldn't help but to hand her a $20 to really say I appreciated her help. As far as food goes, I had the "bunny ravioli". Sounds disturbing, try not to imagine cute lil' furry friends. But I have to admit, it was delicious! Meat was really soft & moist, texture & flavor sort of reminded me of shredded beef. Sauce brought the whole dish together. They had a live jazz band that night, and brought in a dj to close the night off. A great place to have awesome conversations with friends. My guests were impressed that I suggested this place. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!	1
Been a happy customer at Gogi King for awhile... But now, no longer heading back. A first and foremost, they got rid of BANCHAN (Korean Side Dishes). Rather, they bring out random tacos, ramen and ddukboki to fill you up before the meat. Secondly, what happened to the meat? They are all frozen, not fresh, and got rid of galbi and ribeye from the normal menu. Just like that, from a happy customer to a very disappointed one.I have brought countless friends, families, and colleagues to this place... But now, gotta warn them to find other restaurants.  Might as well just raise the price and keep everything the same... Very disappointed... Why Gogi King Why!?	0
This is a nice small non-chain coffee shop. The owners and my waitress were very attentive.<br><br>I had the lobster melt with fruit cup. The sandwich was very good and the fruit was fresh. Service was not slow. My meal was cooked to order.<br><br>I recommend and will be back. The patio would be a nice place to sit in the Spring or Autumn when LV weather is nice.	1
This is my fav breakfast spot in LA for 5 reasons:1. best pancakes 2. best coffee in a porcelain mug3. Mediterranean omelet is divine4. the staff is genuinely awesomeand 5. the trannies walking past on Sunday morning make for great people watching.	1
I'm happy to see people consistently rating this 2-3 stars because the food is standard pub food--nothing exceptional. When I had first moved to Madison for some reason we ate here all the time (Current Tally of Birthday mugs: 5). I say the only reason to eat here is for a friends birthday (if they want a mug). Though it isn't a bad place to eat before or after a Badger game though it is pretty busy at those times--I'd more identify this as a classic place to get a beer when you are in your Badger gear, they always have the good/standard Wisconsin Craft Beers.	0
I've been eating here for years. One of the best diners I've ever eaten in. The ham and cheese omelet is great. Ask for a side of salsa with the omelet, it's even better. The buckwheat pancakes are good and so is the sourdough bread. Not too sure about the dinner menu but breakfast is exceptional. Get there before 9:00am or you'll be waiting in line. Easily one of LA's best.	1
Waited 20 minutes for 20 pieces of chicken. Ridiculous! 2 groups of people that came in after us got their orders first. Gave them an extra star for their Soy Garlic Chicken (which was good!), the only thing that kept this review from being a 1 star. Customer service could use a little improvement.	0
BASIC BASIC BASIC. I guess maybe because I'm Hispanic I expected their tex-mex spin on food to be a bit more flavorful, but that wasn't the case. I sat at the bar , so grabbed a cocktail. I believe I got the roadrunner: mezcal it was savory and balanced ; good job hipster like bartender. Service was prompt . Server was sweet. BUT I probs won't be coming back not suggesting it to my friends... It just lacked the BANG effect on such a cool street.	0
*Update* 9/18/07Well, to be honest, they have been sliding downward in both food quality and service....No lie, the last 8 times I have been there there has been a problem with food...From everything to missing part of the order to waiting 45 minutes for a cold piece of pie when I was almost the only person in the place....The bartender even joked that he felt bad for me because it kept happening....But last night was the last straw....I ordered the Purple Potato Soup, and after about 20 minutes it came out cold and about half full, so I asked if they could heat it up...After ten minutes more it came back out with the bowl almost full, but all watered down, like they had put a cup of boiling water in it....It had been thick! WTF?! I used to come here every week and bring friends, now I wouldn't be caught dead eating that crap!3/01/2007OK...I had been coming here almost every week since they first opened and I have to say that the food and service are pretty uneven...One time I went in and order the roasted beet salad, and it was perfect...Fresh little roasted beets, that were so sweet they tasted like candy, so good in fact that I came back the next night to have it again...And it was sliced canned beets!!!!!!Cold!!! Oh the horror! I was pretty disappointed, but all-in-all it was still a nice salad, so I wasn't going to freak out over it, but sometimes it is kinda like that...A bit hit or miss, but still pretty good....As far as the service, they are starting to recognize me (I sit at the bar), so it is getting better, but other times I find myself trying frantically to get someones attention, only to have them come over to tell me they are not the bartender...and it's not even busy!...But I like the place and I still stop by on the way home occasionally, just not as often anymore...I just don't know what I will get.	0
Wow is all I can say. I haven't been here in a while but their food is amazing. We need a food adventure on Saturday and it was pretty late, on our way to get burgers some one said we should go to the Pantry, and we did. The best choice in my opinion. Their bacon-cheese omelet is still cheese-bacon perfection, with a side of sourdough and potatoes to tame the salty goodness. Lets not forget the side of pancakes. The pancakes are EVIL I TELL YOU! anything that good has to be super bad. I can't wait to go back.	1
The customer service here is pretty good but it may seem a bit on the slow side. The burgers are small but average with a lot of lettuce (I like vegetable so I don&#39;t mind it). The fries look so yummy! I didn&#39;t get it since it was a late dinner and we were ordering desserts! I wasn&#39;t too fond of the apple pie. The crust was too hard and the apple is too soft. The banana creme pie was pretty good, but I can taste the egg in the crust. Overall I think it&#39;s a pretty decent place.	1
I don&#39;t just love lobster rolls, I tend to plan my vacations around them. <br><br>The Lobster Pound&#39;s Maine-style roll was overflowing with delicious lobster meat but lacked taste. I think it could have used a dash of celery salt (like at Luke&#39;s Lobster) to bring out the different flavors.<br><br>The green onion/scallions added a nice texture and crunch to the roll. I enjoyed my trip in Red Hook but found this lobster roll to be underwhelming.	0
A LA institution and the food is typical NY deli style...nothing special really. A bit overpriced and the bakery is ok; most items are a bit stale tasting. Haven&#39;t been back since 2010 when I saw a cockroach crawling up the wall while waiting to be served...eat at your own risk. The &#34;A&#34; doesn&#39;t mean much I guess...	0
I lived in Seattle for 20 years and I've had my share of good bad and mediocre dim sum. Macky's is truly outstanding. The food is fast fresh and incredibly tasty. Restaurant is very clean staff are courteous and the atmosphere is family-friendly. The steamed pork buns and honeyed cashew prawns are out of this world! Great value and hidden gem of Issaquah.	1
Something different!<br><br>Let me start off by saying that Barton G is very loud and extremely crowded. The tables are kind of squeezed in together to make the most of the limited space. The bar area is small and not separated from the main dining area. It&#39;s just all one big (or small) room.<br><br>When we got to Barton G, we weren&#39;t seated right away while they got the table ready. The host came by to keep us updated, so we just hung out at the bar &amp; had some drinks.<br><br>So~ this is what we ordered throughout the night:<br><br>DRINKS~ We ordered some regular cocktails, like the Moscow Mule, Bloody Mary, etc. We also ordered a couple each of the Diamonds Are Forever, Sabrinatini, Buddhalicious, Zen-Tini. LOVE!! I especially liked the vodka sticks that melt into your drink depending on how much you want in there. I was kinda disappointed that the Diamonds Are Forever wasn&#39;t in its presentation tray, but the drink I got was pretty.<br><br>FOOD~ Lobster Pop-Tarts, Voodoo Shrimp Rolls, Laughing Bird Popcorn Shrimp, Lobster Trap Mac &amp; Cheese (add French Truffle for $25), Strike Out Sliders, Blooming Black Cod, Say Ahhh Surf &amp; Turf, Waygu 6oz.<br><br>I loved the lobster pop-tarts and lobster mac &amp; cheese in particular. Everything was tasty though!<br>Our server (Kevin?) was great. He was efficient &amp; pleasant. <br><br>I happened to be sitting at the corner of our table, so I probably got bumped into about a couple dozen times throughout the night. However, it&#39;s definitely not the servers&#39; or busboys&#39; fault they have to work in such cramped quarters.<br><br>&#34;The Damage?&#34; Just shy of $1k! That includes drinks, food, and tip.<br><br>Was it worth it? Yes.<br>Would I go back? Definitely.	1
Pizza was undercooked and overpriced.	0
Apparently they don't let you add on any orders, after the initial. "It'll take 30m for the pancakes" then "Sorry, we cannot add to your order." After we had to change tables so they can accommodate a larger party. Didn't bring out the vinegar dip for a while.Dumplings were OK. Chives and lamb didn't stand out, like Northern Dumplings in Flushing. It took a while for the XLB (we basically finished everything else for over 15m), and we saw them bring in a fresh order from outside somewhere. (It took that long for the XLB, but they wouldn't take a pancake order.)Their orange sauce was kind of Sriracha like, and definitely not like La Vic's.Anyways, leaving hungry and unsatisfied. Too bad too, we were going to buy a large order of the frozen stuff to bring to a party.	0
I should start my review with biggest complaint because the food here is very good, but, if I&#39;m paying $12 for crispy pork belly I think it wouldn&#39;t be too much to ask that it comes with a side of white rice to make it a meal.<br>That being said, the crispy pork belly was hands down one of the best things I&#39;ve tried here so far, the portion is quite small just so you know.<br><br>Everything I&#39;ve tried here so far has been really good to great, so don&#39;t let the location turn you off to trying it. Also don&#39;t confuse it with the Thai place literally next door which serves decent Thai as well but I think this place takes the Cake.	1
Great tasting and quite a variety.	1
Nothing was bad but nothing save maybe the mac and cheese which was an excellent side would make me come back. All of the mains had the same basic flavors zero contrast. I suppose if you love kimchi flavored everything this is the place for you.	0
Went there because we needed to shop around the area and wanted a quick lunch. Three powerful reasons why I&#39;m not going back:<br><br>#1 - The food is mediocre at best. Sort of Taco Bell for twice the price<br>#2 - The upselling is ferocious. Everything I ordered, an order of nacho, a quesadilla and some tacos was upsold. The girl behind the cash register kept pushing me for additional sides (e.g., meat on my nachos) without telling me that they were extra. Not that I care, but the experience is a huge turnoff and speaks volume about their ethics.<br>#3 - The place is outrageously noisy. So noisy --on a Sunday at 1pm!-- that I could barely talk to my spouse across the table.<br><br>A most unpleasant experience!	0
So I couldn&#39;t believe that I was eating healthy Cuban food! I didn&#39;t even know that existed! Full of flavor, low salt, low fat, simply delicious. Even the dessert (I had ricotta) was great, and it had no sugar! Now, the icing on the cake was the service: such a warm, kind, and pleasant lady! This combination of good food and excellent customer service is a rare find, so even though my first thought was to just stop by and take a look, I ended up staying, enjoying the tasty food and loving the wonderful company. Definitely recommend!	1
Must go back to try everything on their menu.<br><br>Had the soft shell crab po boy, Japanese beef short rib taco, raw ahi tuna taco, and the carnitas pork taco. They were all very delicious. The crab could have been bigger, but nonetheless, had great flavor and was very satisfying. While some of their components are fried and certainly not the healthiest, nothing was overly greasy or too heavy. All ingredients were very fresh and vibrant. Also, while everything was flavorful, nothing was too salty, which is a common hindrance of many other places. Each taco (and I assume the other items) seems to be very well thought out, cohesive and well balanced.<br><br>What I loved even more than their food was their service. My food was ready to be picked up at the counter and the guy saw that I was struggling and he apologized that he should have just brought the food to my table in the first place. The guys there were genuinely very happy and excited and helpful.<br><br>Extremely tasty elevated diner/street food and one of the best services I&#39;ve ever experienced (others, take note)! Can&#39;t wait to come back!	1
Every time we come here we have awful service. And the manager turned off the sound to a football game in OT. When we asked to turn it back on he said, &#34;OK, but we aren&#39;t a sports bar.&#34; Definitely not coming back. And we continued to come back despite the awful service. But rudeness won&#39;t be tolerated...	0
Another great lunch stop in the Arts District! My friend and I stopped in for a hearty lunch: I got the Carbonnade de Flamande; he got the Grilled Cheese Melt (quite possibly the most boring thing on the menu LOL). Predictably, he said his was okay. But we agreed that mine was truly something special: two medallions of beef on a bed of sauteed spinach over mashed potatoes. I could not do it justice, but the flavor was stellar. All libations are Belgian, and a host of options are available. The Mort Subite Kriek is especially worthy. A special thumbs-up to Travis, our server, for all the amazing suggestions. They all paid off.	1
Some in our party were hungry (me), and others in our party just wanted something to nibble on with their drinks. Marietta did a good job of satisfying us all. I had the soft-shell crab special, which was deliciously salty. My friends loved the quail, and we all enjoyed the smoky pork shoulder rillette thing (it was called something else on the menu). Only the fried green tomatoes were a little too deep-fried for our liking. The service was fine, none of the delays or issues reported elsewhere. Can&#39;t wait to come back and have a cocktail or two. A great addition to the neighborhood.	1
Dirty. Like dirt on the forks and knives dirty. <br>Bad service. They never came back to check on us and the guy next to us got his burger a full 5 minutes after his fries. <br>Not delicious. Certainly not umami. <br>Will never be back.	0
Service: I&#39;d give it 5 stars. Despite its trendiness, the staff was surprisingly engaging and friendly. Food: all over the place. The bacon covered lamb chops were an enormous disappointment. They were 2 of the smallest lamb chops I&#39;ve ever seen...and I could have lived with that if they weren&#39;t horribly overcooked and gamey. It was like lamb jerky. This was followed by my porterhouse pork chop which was perfect and HUGE, served over a tasty bed of black eyed peas and cabbage. My friends weren&#39;t so lucky. 2 of them got a sadly uneventful spaghetti dish. The other got the deep fried skate which, though yummy, was more like fast food over thousand island dressing. They bounced back with some delicious desserts. Now for the drinks. They were truly a travesty. They were $15. If they had been interesting, or strong, or large I wouldn&#39;t complain about the price. Unfortunately, I had the Pisco Sour which is a drink I&#39;m particularly picky about and this was the worst Pisco Sour I&#39;ve ever had. A drink that is notoriously strong and bitter was so weak and sweet that I finished it in about 2 minutes...and it was small. My friends had various other specialty cocktails. They complained about them being weak and packed with ice. This is unforgivable...the worst offense. Now for the bathroom. There is only 1 bathroom and the place holds about 125 people. Just not cool AT ALL. And to top this off, there was a girl in this tiny bathroom (which is elevated 3 steps over the bar area) who did not lock the door. So I open the door and she&#39;s standing up with her bare ass toward the door doing god knows what, screams (causing the bar area which is packed to look up) and pushes the door closed. She emerges a few minutes later and I just looked the other way because eye contact was more than I could handle at that point. And the entire bar has seen her butt. As for the crowd at the bar - think &#34;desperate overdressed girls&#34; and &#34;creepy lecherous dudes&#34;...all thinking they are wildly hip for being south of Houston St....painful.	0
Great spot and full bar! I've had tons of things on the menu and all were great. I would definitely come back!!	1
Had this on the list for a few weeks. Was really in the mood for good Pommes Frites. We stopped by on a Sunday night. They have valet, but lots of close pay-by-phone parking available. We were given a nice outside table outside. Staff was efficient and attentive. As you may know, menu has one entree, steak! Was done to perfection and unlimited fries and sauce were delicious. Manager stopped by to check on us during the meal. The desert choices are great. I had the Profiteroles served with nutella sauce, wife had the Creme Brulee. Unfortunately, Ii had not set correctly. they comped it and offered to make her something else right away.	1
Are you kidding me right now??!!!  CUT absolutely blew us away!!!  Our experience was BEYOND excellent!!!  From start to finish, they made us feel so special... I thought maybe they sat the wrong people or something.  Perhaps they thought we were VIP members of a royal family????  Nope!  Let's start from the beginning...- made my reservation on OpenTable and i typed in a small note that this was our 15 yr anniversary and just hoped for a nice table which to us meant maybe not too close to the kitchen where it might be loud....  I didn't think much of it.- arrived to find they had set up a beautiful, quiet and large romantic booth just for the 2 of us. ELEGANT IN EVERY WAY!- looked at the menu and saw that it had been personalized and printed especially for us and under our name which was just so sweet- lovely and attentive staff checked on us regularly and made sure glasses were filled and our needs were met at all times- quality steaks were BEYOND!!!! JUST BEYOND AMAZING!!!- we were so full and satisfied at the end of the meal we decided to pass on the dessert... The Cut Staff would not accept that on our special night and brought out their favorite dessert COMPLIMENTS OF THE HOUSE, with the words &quot;Happy 15th Anniversary&quot; written in chocolate... WE LOVED IT!  Don't know what else to say other than....    Thank you, CUT!!!  You made our anniversary a night too remember!!!!	1
So thrilled this place has moved in! It&#39;s exactly the sort of business I&#39;ve been hoping would come downtown...a specialty shop that will become a destination for folks. <br><br>I met Samantha early on and she&#39;s so friendly and excited about her place...Ebbie and June are also lovely, and really get the DTLA vibe. <br><br>Had a bunch of samples as they were getting things rolling...sausage roll, spinach feta roll, chicken pie, latte...all delicious. They pour Longshot coffee, which is yummy.<br><br>I&#39;ve gone in multiple times since, and it&#39;s always casual, friendly, and chill - folks hanging out at the counter, on laptops, just hanging out. It&#39;s a great food to take away, too.<br><br>The rolls are made with a wonderfully flaky pastry around the meat or veggies and cheese. The pies have rich but not overpowering fillings, and the crusts are tender and tasty. They also offer a vegan option, which is very smart.<br><br>It&#39;s located off of Los Angeles Street in the alley that leads into the Santee courtyard...look for the Subway, then turn into the alley.	1
Oooh how I love chowdah!	1
If you are looking for an intimate, friendly restaurant with delicious food, this is your place. We had the ossobuco and swordfish, which were both perfectly cooked. The beef carpaccio was not my favorite but the fresh mozarrella and tomatoes were spot on. There was a little bit of a wait for a table but well worth the wait. The service was excellent and attentive. They say this place is not good for kids but we brought our kids and we were fine. We definitely will be back for more.	1
I have absolutely zero idea how this place is so popular. I must have completely missed something during my visit.Went with a friend and we got the huevos rancheros, the breakfast wrap, a regular coffee and an iced coffee. Came out to ~$30. Not unreasonable.Picked up the drinks at the counter, then had to walk all the way to the other side of the place to get some creamer, which especially sucked because they didn't leave room for any and they only had whole milk. Didn't even mind that I spilled half the coffee on the floor by the time I got back to the table.After 20 minutes our food came to our table, carried by a gentlemen who apologized because apparently they gave us the wrong number. Didn't even give us utensils, napkins or condiments. Slow and bad service, but that wasn't even the main problem.The food was disgusting. I found a rock in my huevos rancheros and I'm pretty sure I'm going to want to faint when I have to go to the bathroom next. The sandwich wrap looked just as bad. But I did realize that most of the other patrons of this establishment had only ordered coffees and drinks; not food. Regardless, the coffee at this place was not that good anyways.	0
For a place that's only been open four days they have their act together pretty well. The space is very nice for the neighborhood. Simple but warm and inviting. The current pics don't do it justice. Service staff was informed and courteous. Now the food: Overall everything had a good amount of flavor. The deviled eggs were very good but not amazing. Spaghetti with meatballs was tasty but was a little too spicy for my 8 year old. However, he gobbled up the meatballs and he's not a big meat eater. The Italian sausage with beans and greens had a great flavor. My daughter ordered the steak and it was delicious and perfectly cooked. The halibut was fantastic, perfectly cooked and seasoned. The veggies give a nice contrast in texture and flavor to the fish. The only real letdown was the linguine and clams. It was way over-seasoned with crushed red pepper and very coarse black pepper. It overpowered the taste of the clams and had way too much salt. Overall we left feeling excited that there is a quality italian restaurant in the neighborhood that is still kid friendly.	1
We had reservations but had to wait 1/2 hour to be seated. For appetizers we had the still warm mozzarella which was very good. We also had the chicken and pork sausage with potato salad which was very good. For dinner I had the akaushi cheeseburger which I did not like at all (I took two bites and handed it over to my husband). Shake Shack has a better burger. The fries that came with it were good. My husband had the tomatoes, buffalo mozzarella and basil pizza which was not that great either. Our server was great and very friendly. After all the hype we heard about ABC Kitchen, we were disappointed.	0
Kevin was great!!! The presentation was amazing ! I tired the wagyu steak and I loved it.	1
Never brought my tea and desert until I asked. Then they charged us for extras they brought to our table we never ordered! Seriously? The only reason they even get a star because food was ok.	0
I have been going to The Apple Pan since as far back as I can remember. I think the same holds true for my parents generation and grandparents generation (not that either in my family are from Los Angeles).<br><br>Simply put, this is a special place. I&#39;m almost offended when I see people comparing it to In-N-Out. And yes, I like In-N-Out.<br><br>The Apple Pan is an LA institution. The place has looked the same my entire life... There is only counter seating, there is grandmother-type wallpaper, and the cash register is 500 years old (well, basically).<br><br>The employees here have been there forever. I recognize the day workers and the night workers. They are ALWAYS the same people.<br><br>The burgers are absolutely delicious and totally unique. They are very filling, much more-so that most other burgers. They have a unique apple-based sauce. The fries are great, and for some reason the Coke just tastes better out of the little paper cone that they serve it to you in. The Tuna Sandwich is very good, and so I hear... the Egg Salad Sandwich is also very good. Not to mention, you must try the Apple Pie.<br><br>This is the type of place where you get regulars like me who have been coming in again and again for their entire lives. You will see that many patrons will know the guys behind the counter on a first name basis and visa versa.<br><br>Nothing but 5-stars from me... I really want to go there for dinner right now...<br><br>And yes, expect a wait... at all hours of the day or night.	1
*sigh*Inattentive wait staff. Unimpressive food. Yet, really lovely music. That was a nice touch, but I can play my own jazz music at home. Smoooooth jazz. And heat up pot stickers from Costco. Really? Is there nowhere good to eat in SOMA. Please tell me there is a hidden gem within a reasonable walking distance of our house. That has dinner service.	0
not all that view is great long is long and dome , food is not that good , customer service could be way better	0
The Bobbie: delicious homemade turkey and stuffing, but the cranberry sauce was the downside for me. i love cranberries but not with my meat. it&#39;s just a bit odd with all the sweetness when it isn&#39;t matched by any saltiness<br><br>Capastrami: love the name, not so much the sandwich...the meat is very sweet, almost in a bad way. maybe it was the russian dressing or the cole slaw but this was a disappointment because i loooooove pastrami<br><br>order the largest size for ~$12 and cut it up and share with everyone. there&#39;s definitely enough to feed 3 people with one sub. by the time we left, the place was packed. glad i tried something off the strip for once!	0
I am a huge fan of boiling crab, I&#39;ve been to different boiling crabs in norcal and socal; honestly, this is the worst that I&#39;ve ever had. I always think boiling crab is better than hot n juicy, no matter the seasoning, freshness of it&#39;s seafood. <br>My gf and I ordered 1lb of frozen crawfish, 2lb of shrimp is different sauce; I knew the frozen crawfish taste bad, I haven&#39;t eaten the frozen one before, so I wanted to give it a shot, but I was totally regretted. DO NOT TRY THE FROZEN CRAWFISH!!!<br>on the other hand, our shrimp order is a bit weird. I could tell the freshness is different in each bag. I had no idea but the other bag is fishy and spoiled (very much!).<br>I knew restaurants could not give their best to every customers. I am not the kind of spreading &#34;DO NOT GO HERE&#34; after having bad experience. I always like boiling crab, so I would give another shot.	0
This review applies specifically to their weekend brunch. ABC Kitchen is probably a better venue for dinner or some kind of evening meal. The restaurant was extremely dark for a mid-afternoon meal! I had to ask our server to figure out how to turn the light on above our table just so I could read the menu. Two women sat down at a table next to mine and they immediately asked to be re-seated at another table (they didn&#39;t have any additional lights that could be turned on). Found myself wishing I had done the same. Aside from these complaints, the food was only alright (some items were far too salty - i.e. cheddar chive biscuits). Bottom line - really just not worth the price/ effort to dine here for brunch.	0
I will start by saying there is much to like about this restaurant from a location and aesthetics standpoint. It really drew us in. The night we ate there, it was really busy and we sat outside with a view of the capitol. We were kind of forgotton about and had to wait a really long time for all of our food. I am gluten free and this is the main reason I am writing this review. I find reviews of how restaurants handle those who eat this way, for whatever reason, so helpful. This restaurant has a GF menu (I have celiac) which was a huge bonus. However my soup which I ordered off the GF menu came out with a huge slice of sourdough laying on the soup spoon. Not a huge deal to get another spoon but made me nervous as to how aware they really were. Then the wait for our entrees took so long I had to leave with my 2 year old daughter because she had run out of patience. I am sure it is great on less busy nights, but we weren't able to enjoy the experience that night.	0
Oh NO! Are you kidding me? Drive around for 20 minutes to find parking, wait in line to sit on a stool, order from a grumpy waiter, order burger fries soda and pie, Get small un-memorable portions and pay $15 and leave. For the same price take two friends to In and out or one friend to The Counter, Those waxing nostalgia for this place are lost in a dream.	0
This was the first place I visited when arriving in Los Angeles last week and it&#39;s first impression did not disappoint! Went on sunday so we were able to catch the brunch special and the incredible bottomless drink menu! they do not skimp on the good stuff in the drinks and never let your glass sit empty for very long. The food was delicious and portions huge! oh yeah, and their appetizer?... froot loops and lucky charms!!	1
Super tasty food (I had a smoked salmon sandwich), but be aware that if you order your sandwich on ciabiatta bread, you&#39;ll end up with something half the size of other sandwiches. Which was actually a good size for me and would have been fine if they charged half the price but...<br><br>But they serve Lavazza coffee! Yum. Croissants were decent but not the best I&#39;ve ever had in Miami.	1
Perch should be named a &#34;speakeasy&#34; since it&#39;s somewhat hidden as you have to enter a building and go up two elevators to reach this spot. We came here for a rooftop gathering with some friends and enjoyed the spectacular view of downtown LA and the delicious Manhattans. The drinks were definitely well-made and we met the bouncer, Rene, who was very friendly. We will return again sometime and maybe check out the food as well.	1
Stopped by to by bread and chocolate croissantsFirst it was really expensive , $36 for 2 loafs of bread, 2 2 chocolate croissants and 1 coffee.The worst part of it is that it was just not good at all. Bread is better and much cheaper at whole foods and croissants are better everywhere else.Two stars for the nice decor only	0
By the time we came here, we were hangry. We tried two other places and either they were closed or too busy. That means this place had to come through or we would have flip their tables like Chinese gangster style (maybe not that exaggerated)<br><br>We ordered the roti, the first noodle soup dish and lamb. Being hungry, we devoured each dish before the next came out. The Roti was not fried so it was not greasy. I rather liked it more this way. It also came with a bowl of curry for dipping. There was a piece of chicken and potato in the bowl. For less than $5, it was really awesome.<br>The noodle dish was good and had a seafood flavor like Big Wong&#39;s shrimp soup. What I didn&#39;t like about the noodle dish is I think it was spaghetti noodles, and I usually like soft noodle but these were almost mushy. The lamb was not gamey and had all this brown sauce over it. When I see that I think it would be too salty but it was actually perfect in flavor. These are not flavors I am used I&#39;m not even sure what they used to make it with. We finished everything. <br><br>What I didn&#39;t like was their tea. It was supposed to be Jasmine but they were flavorless bags of tea. <br><br>We will come back to try the rest of their menu.	1
I&#39;m so sorry Romeo to do this to you, but I feel like you left room for improvement. The atmosphere is romantic, you are charming and your food is delicious, but your location and quality of food do not match your pricing. I really, really wanted to give you 5 stars, but I didn&#39;t have the heart to tell you in person that filet mignon doesn&#39;t need to be cut into small pieces and added to risotto if it really is the cut you price it to be...<br><br>I will say, I left full and there were moments that reminded me of some of my mother&#39;s best cooking, but I don&#39;t understand how you justify pricing yourself above Prime 112, Casa Tua, or Michael&#39;s Genuine. At $150/per person, after wine, gratuity and tax, you are the most expensive restaurant in Miami.	0
